# bgger
A sample of an app I am working on/playing with that re-purposes GeekLists on BGG.

This is an app I started working on to learn Grails 3 and to scratch an itch I had dealing with BGG's GeekLists.

There is a lot of hard-coded stuff that needs to be fixed (like hard-coded to my username and my RSS feed to Subscriptions)

Released under Apache -- do with this what you want.
