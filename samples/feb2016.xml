[size=14][b][u]Game Ratings:[/u][/b][/size]
It&#039;s somewhat of a custom to give a brief set of ratings for any game that gets posted here, to give others an idea of what to expect.   It would be really great to see that continue!

Not sure what to do?    Just give a quick set of comments, as little as a single sentence each, telling us one thing that you like :thumbsup: about the game and two things that you dislike :thumbsdown::thumbsdown:.

Can&#039;t think of anything you dislike about the game?   Try to to come up with at least something that others might not like about it.   

Want to list more than just three things?   Go nuts!
Don&#039;t want to list anything at all?   Go nuts!

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][size=14]Find and post an image of a game component with a HEART.[/size][/BGCOLOR] 

[COLOR=#FF0000][size=14][CHALLENGE CLOSED][/size][/COLOR]

[i]It could be component shaped like a heart, a component with a heart pictured on it, or the board or a box with a heart shown, or even a picture of the band Heart.[/i]

Those of you that have been around SGOYT for a long time may remember this from a list a few years back, but for those of you that are newer or anyone that needs a refresher, here are the rules:

[b]1)   All images must be from BGG.[/b]  [i](No external links are allowed.)[/i]
[b]2)  All images must be pre-existing on BGG.[/b]   [i](In other words, all images posted must be from January 2016 or earlier.   You can&#039;t take a picture and upload it yourself to avoid having to search.)[/i]
[b]3)   Each GAME can be posted only once.[/b]   [i](If someone else has already posted a Heart-shaped item from a game, you have to find something from another game, even if there are multiple different hearts in that first game.   For the sake of argument, all expansions are counted with their base game even if the hearts weren&#039;t part of the base game.)[/i]
[b]4)  One [i]successful[/i] entry per user.[/b]   [i](Some of your might have an easier time finding images than others, but to keep it fair please just post one each.   If you post something that gets denied because someone else beat you to it, you can of course try again.)[/i]
[b]5)  Please post your finds as a reply to this item.[/b]  [i](Feel free to post images of hearts along with your postings elsewhere in this list, but you&#039;ll only get credit for them if they&#039;re here.)[/i]


[b]This challenge runs until Midnight (BGG/Central/GMT-6) on Sunday, February 7th.[/b]  You can of course continue posting images after that (even if you&#039;ve previously posted), but you won&#039;t get credit for them.




[b]To make it easier for everyone (especially me) to keep track, here&#039;s the list of all of the games that have been claimed so far:[/b]

	<body>[size=16][b]Challenge #2: Hashtag Wars[/b][/size] 

In the style of the hilarious show @Midnight, the goal of this challenge will be:
[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][size=20][b]#HeartABoardGame[/b][/size][/BGCOLOR].


How do you play?  Simply post the title of a board game, but with a twist to the wording that somehow includes a heart, references hearts, or has at least something vaguely to do with hearts in some way.  It&#039;s wide open to interpretation and pretty much anything goes, but the idea is to be as funny and/or clever as possible.   [i](Please keep it tasteful.)[/i]


Some examples include:    Heartem Horror (Arkham Horror), Hearts of War (Gears of War), At the Valves of Loyang (At the Gates of Loyang).   These are all terrible, but should give you the right idea.   [b]YOU CAN DO BETTER![/b]


Quick Rules:
[b]1)  One entry per person, per day.[/b]  I&#039;m sure there are plenty of you that could come up with a dozen great ideas right off the top of your heads, but you have to give everyone else a chance too.
[b]2)  One entry per reply.[/b]  If you post five at once, we won&#039;t know which one is actually getting the thumbs.  Plus this spaces them out a bit to give more chances to everyone.
[b]3)  Check back frequently and thumb any and all entries that you enjoy.[/b]


[b]This Challenge runs until Midnight (BGG/Central/GMT-6) on Sunday, February 14th.[/b]  

The [b]Most-Thumbed[/b] entry at that time will earn :bag: [b]20 GeekGold[/b] :bag:!

Discretionary :gg: will be handed out in between.

[size=14][COLOR=#FF0000][CHALLENGE CLOSED!][/COLOR][/size]

The winner is...

[user=reggiemcfly][/user]

...With his entry &quot;Zulus on the Ramphearts&quot; [article=6127381](Link to Item)[/article] which collected 16 :thumbsup:.




[COLOR=#FF0000][b]The big pot has been claimed, but discretionary GG is still readily available, so if any of you have been saving up ideas go ahead and post as many as you want now without restriction.[/b][/COLOR]

	<body>[size=14][b]Challenge #3:  Heart Stories[/b][/size]

As the header to this list indicates, [COLOR=#FF0000]February is Heart Month[/COLOR], which is intended to bring awareness of all sorts of heart-related issues, whether it&#039;s heart disease, heart defects, heart surgery, blood-donations, or anything else along those lines.    

Most if not all of us have had some experience with at least one of those at some point in our lives, either directly ourselves, or indirectly through a loved one, a close friend, or some other acquaintance.

So, for this &quot;challenge&quot;, which isn&#039;t really a challenge at all, I invite everyone to share your stories.
Have you or someone you loved had heart surgery?   Have you lost someone close to you to heart disease or a heart attack?   Have you given blood lately?   Have you recently fallen in love and/or suffered a broken heart?   Anything you wish to share at all that&#039;s related to the heart.






Why is Batman the image for this entry?   Why not?   HE&#039;S BATMAN.

Now for something a bit lighter...

There are tons of Microbadges out there for people that are famous or notable in some way.  For example, the legendary Abe Vigoda, who recently passed away at the ripe old age of 94 due to natural causes, appears as the &quot;patron saint of wargamer requests&quot; (whatever that means??):  [microbadge=24366]

For this &quot;challenge&quot;, post a link to a [i][b]Microbadge[/b][/i] depicting someone famous that means something to you, and then tell us a little about why you&#039;re a fan of that person.  The [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/browse/purchase]Microbadge Database[/url] is loaded with a wide variety of people, including actors, musicians, authors, athletes, scientists, and more.   Maybe the person has inspired you in some way, maybe you really enjoy a role they&#039;ve played or a book they wrote, maybe they&#039;re the star player from your favorite team, perhaps they invented or discovered something awesome, maybe you just really like how they look (even a crush, perhaps?), or any number of other reasons.

-If you can&#039;t narrow it down to just one, go ahead and list several at once.
-If you don&#039;t already own the Microbadge for some reason, let us know why not.
-If there&#039;s someone that you think [i]needs[/i] to have a Microbadge but doesn&#039;t have one ([i]or you can&#039;t find it[/i]), let us know too and maybe someone else with the talent for MB creation will offer to make it.
-No worries about duplication in this one - you can add a person even if they&#039;ve already been posted by someone else.


-To promote a bit more variety, please avoid posting anyone that&#039;s directly involved with board games, whether it&#039;s a designer, publisher, reviewer, podcaster, 1P Guild member, etc., unless they&#039;ve achieved some level of fame outside of board gaming.</body>

	<body>This will be my main play for February.  I&#039;ll be trying out some new campaign cards, and giving a Marine Corps campaign a try.

[b]IRAN 2014[/b]
[i]Long Campaign, 9 days[/i]
[i]Marine Corps[/i]

[b]**Planning**[/b]

Turnip / G / AV-88 Harrier
Crispy / G / AV-88 Harrier     
Thor / G / F-35B/C Lightning II
Kong / A / AV-88 Harrier
Mystic / A / AV-88 Harrier
Dino / A / AV-88 Harrier
Animal / A / AV-88 Harrier
Pyro / A / F-35B/C Lightning II
Salsa / S / F-35B/C Lightning II
Burger / S / F-35B/C Lightning II
Meatball / S / AV-88 Harrier
Big Time / Ace / AV-88 Harrier

I started with 40 SOs and the Harriers gave me an additional +60.  I spent 54 to promote three pilots - Big Time to Ace, Turnip to Green, Salsa to Skilled - leaving me with 46.

Though some of my guys have some pretty hilarious names (Salsa, Burger, Meatball, Turnip and Crispy have me feeling pretty hungry), I actually used my intelligence to select pilots for this mission.  Now that I understand the game better, this was a ton of fun.  It took me over an hour to pick the pilots, and choose which level they would start at, and who would get promoted.  

I&#039;m feeling pretty good about this line up for this campaign.  It will be strange to not have any F-14s this time around, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find the strengths the Harriers and F-35s have to offer soon enough.

[b]**Planning, Round 2**[/b]
Oops, I missed reading the date on the F-35, they are 2014-present so I&#039;m going to have to redo my planning for 1984.  Thanks, Scarge, for catching that.  

[b]**Planning, Round 3**[/b]
Oops, I apparently can&#039;t read at all.  Harriers are 1985-present so they aren&#039;t legit for Libya 1984.  Time for a different campaign card.

[b]**Planning, Round 4**[/b]
New campaign card is Iran 2014 which starts with 70 SO&#039;s.  After adjustments, I&#039;ll be starting the campaign with 76 SO&#039;s!  Looking forward to using a lot of JDAM this campaign.  The first 8 SO&#039;s every day are free, so that&#039;s pretty sweet too.  I&#039;ve been away from this for over a week what with business travel and coming down with a horrible chest cold.  Hopefully I&#039;ll get a few missions in this weekend.  One can only lay in bed for so long....

[b]Day 1[/b]
I drew the Missile Boat Fleet target, a scramble, so off we went.  Big Time, Meatball, Kong, Crispy, and Dino.  This target was very interesting: Scramble, Small, Dispersed, Vehicle, and a nasty Improvement that increased the WP penalty of all Targets by 1.  Yuck.  I loaded the boys up with AGM-65 Maverick&#039;s.  They are immune to the Dispersed trait and the give a +3 DRM against vehicles.  I took a couple Mk 20&#039;s as they are lighter.  I also spread around some AIM-120 AMRAAMs.  

Though I was missing my F-14s and their lovely Phoenix missiles, both Big Time and Meatball had situational awareness.  Big Time has 3 (!) and he&#039;s the Flight Leader so he can share.  Aw, thanks, Big Time.  So, I had Meatball, Big Time and Kong attack as fast pilots with the AMRAAMs and took down all three MiGs.  That was sweet.  On turn 2, when we were within 2 range of the target, we unloaded the Maverick&#039;s on the Target.  The Target only needed 4 hits to be destroyed, and it was pretty easy to do.  Good dice rolling plus good stats is a lucky combo.  Target destroyed on Turn 2!  Great start!

Big Time&#039;s 3 situational awareness, plus he&#039;ll likely always be flight leader as the resident Ace, was really nice.  I don&#039;t have a lot of fast pilots, but the situational awareness flexibility should not be underestimated.  It made this mission feel easy.  Thanks to the Mavericks and the fact that the Target was a vehicle made this feel easy too.  I&#039;m not complaining though!  

Getting used to the Harriers is going to take awhile. They are very WP limited.  I&#039;m used to loading up those A-6s with a ton of AtG, and I&#039;m not going to be able to do that this campaign.  Also, when the Harriers fly low, they have Nap of the Earth which means that any site/target damage is given as stress instead.  So, maybe I should scrap the ECM pods?  Every WP counts...

	<body>I&#039;ll be working on my solo 10x10 during the month.  I&#039;ve been randomly choosing what gets played each week, and am trying to get in two games a week, so I expect to get eight games in during February.  I&#039;ll be tracking them on the GeekList (I was 5-5 in January), but I&#039;ll put some updates here as well.

:d10-1: [thing=129437][/thing]: Defeated Magneto, the Brotherhood, the Sentinels, and the Midtown Bank Robbery with 56 points.  I ended up rescuing 23 Bystanders, with six left in the Villain deck and one more still out in the City.  Next time, I think I need to play with the advanced rules.
:d10-2: [thing=75223][/thing]: Lost on the very last connection I had to make.  I had two days left and was making the connection between the Seal of Balance and the Golden Chassis when I got a negative result, knocking me unconscious.  I ran out of days as I recovered, but at least I was asleep for the end of the world.
:d10-2:.:5db: [thing=25314][/thing]: Not on my 10x10, but I wanted to try out this Sid Sackson solitaire game.  I scored 110 on my first try.  Interesting - I&#039;d play that again.
:d10-3: [thing=65244][/thing]: I played on Elite (first time I&#039;ve ever played that level) with the Pilot and Diver.  I won!
:d10-4: [thing=71836][/thing]: Victory on the basic version.  I got the last three doors with keys in my hand, and there were still three Nightmares left in the deck, so I did pretty well.
:d10-5: [thing=43570][/thing]: I had eight life left at the end of phase one, but I hadn&#039;t really added anything good.  Phase two ended with one life, and then I had no life while needing four more fighting points just two hazards from the pirates.  Oh well.
:d10-6: [thing=54201][/thing]: The dice were very kind to me, and I was able to make it to Reno in 39 days.  I almost lost it on Day 25 with no food, but I was able to bring in two more with four 2s, and managed to make it through with 34 points.</body>

	<body>Ok, first edit- since February is Valentines day and about lovey dovey stuff :gulp: I&#039;ve decided to complete one of the stars on my personal &quot;game playing list and goals for 2016&quot; with one of the first board games I ever fell in love with. Decent 2nd might not be the same as she once was but, neither am I and we&#039;ve both grown, aged, and gained new quirks but we still love one another!

Will have the materials set aside by this weekend and have my 3 heroes posted up. Once I get it played I will return here with a session report and MANY more pictures for everyone&#039;s enjoyment! :D



Heroes assemble! [imageid=2873350]

For my next trick I will sort out what I need to actually play, then I&#039;ll get some weekend dungeon crawling in!</body>

	<body>Crossposted from [geeklist=200803][/geeklist]: 

My first game of Sentinels ever since I fell in love with it again late in 2014 last year. Today&#039;s random mashup was the Infinitor (level 2) versus Bunker, Tempest, Nightmist, and Wraith. I managed to get the Infinitor down to 20-odd health, but it wasn&#039;t enough, due to gross miscalculations in exactly how much damage would be coming from where. This is a bit dangerous when one of your characters (Nightmist) damages herself often. 

Plus Infinitor&#039;s default reduction of all damage to Villain targets by 1 meant that Tempest&#039;s many powers were ineffective, so the fight was probably a lot harder than it might otherwise be. 

Still, the joy of the game is seeing how powers interact. And while I definitely am capable of keeping track of everything in this game, when I&#039;m mentally stretched out is probably not the time to do it. One of the things I want to do is to pull a set of random heroes, then go up against a level 1 villain, then level 2, then level 3, just to get the hang of it all. 

Sentinels is not a game for people who will only play it once a year, that&#039;s for certain. I should probably replace Imperial Settlers with Sentinels on my 10x10, or make up a 5x20 challenge, or something. </body>

	<body>This game is so hard to find for a decent price here, I haven&#039;t bought a hard copy of it... yet.

Last week, iOS released the app version made by [user=Peterk1]

I&#039;ve been playing it for hours, since I got it. Although, my understanding of baseball rules is certainly very thin, it&#039;s not a problem to play this excellent game.

When I mentioned the app, in a comment last week, [user=Peterk1]Peter[/user] asked for favor...

[q=&quot;peterk1&quot;][q=&quot;koinskyz&quot;]I finally had the opportunity to taste BBH2045, on my iPad.
[/q]
Can I ask a favor? Can you take a picture of the app surrounded by the Alps, or some ancient ruins somewhere like you do for all the boardgames!   :) [/q]

That was harder to do than I thought at first; taking a picture of an iPad mini &quot;in action&quot; under the sun isn&#039;t that easy. I finally spent the weekend taking pictures on my iPad in different locations (even in a stadium where I went to see a rugby match) which felt like a rather silly activity... ;) 

[imageid=2870221large]

Thank you for the app Peter! 
It&#039;s a true pleasure to have finally access to this great game. It will ease the reading of the numerous posts that will inevitably appear in the geeklist :)</body>

I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I have not gotten past War Phase 1 yet, but I keep coming back for more.

Plus, I&#039;m setting up a vertical magnetic board using Orisek Counter Holders and an old metal table top.

Should be fun.</body>

	<body>First game for the month, which I had been trying to get to the table again for the past few days, and finally managed today :) I received the Dynasties expansion last week, and have gone through and got them all sorted in as well as making a comparative list of all the factions - there are some very interesting ones which I am quite keen to try.

However, I do want to have a go at all the B sides, as well as the new factions, so for this game I went with Rome from the base game, with their Dynasty cards to the side. The addition of the expansion means that I will have to go back and replay all the factions that I&#039;ve done so far (actually only 2 ^^), but that&#039;s not a bad thing :) The Dynasty cards also add some more variety to the factions, subtely changing the way that they work when you put their new cards into play and on the same foot upgrading/changing their ability. 2 Military is good at the start, but by late game it&#039;s not so useful.

[imageid=2870295 medium]

Trying to play to their strengths I did an early focus (sorta ^^) on military, and grabbed a antiquity colony, but unfortunately I didn&#039;t get another for a while - as is its nature the shadow player had the habit of wiping the columns that I still wanted. Not as bad as other sessions I&#039;ve had, but it is all down to the dice after all. Late game picked up, especially once I was able to grab another colony (but not the third alas that I was after), a couple more wonders that helped stabilise my nation, and one of the new dynasty progress cards that gave decent VP but only let you put one worker on it, but it was too little too late for my score (42, my lowest yet). It was a fun session, and I look forward to playing it more :)

Edit: Oh yeah, ratings :P
:thumbsup: The new dynasty cards add more flexibility/variety to the nations.
:thumbsup: building up a civ is as fun as ever.
:thumbsup: Abraham Lincoln is an awesome advisor!
:thumbsdown: Didn&#039;t end up putting the dynasties into play in this session. I couldn&#039;t quite work in the direction that I wanted to, so I kept on holding onto the default +2 Military, and didn&#039;t really need the other abilities. It will vary from session to session tho.
:thumbsdown: The shadow player is as annoying as ever. It&#039;s a feature, and part of the solo game is working around and with that nature, but it&#039;s not for all.

Stage of Development: Ruleset (first draft)
[ImageID=2870247medium]
I&#039;ll begin this month posting something I love to do:

I&#039;ve been working on a puzzle quite a bit recently. It&#039;s really a solo game unto itself, and I think I enjoy this sort of thing as much as playing anything solo. As many of you already know so well, it&#039;s called game design, and I&#039;m at that stage where ideas are beginning to either reject one another or come together nicely.

For this WIP, the pieces of ideas have fallen into place rather naturally. But, there&#039;s a point in most of my previous design attempts where it&#039;s realized the game won&#039;t work as imagined in my head. Then the wheels come off, and I lose all interest. I&#039;m worried that point might be approaching fast.

I&#039;m a graphics guy. it&#039;s what really draws me to games initially. So, this time as I collect ideas, I draw them out in Illustrator or Inkscape - drawing all the pieces and describing how they work in the context of the game. Ten counters become a hundred and twenty counters. a chart here. A display there. And an 11x17 map that continues to grow... and after printing all the components and making all the counters (that I know will see many changes), I&#039;m finally working through the setup and sequence of play. As I do that, I&#039;m writing/rewriting rules and editing graphics on the fly. It&#039;s a really enjoyable process when everything fits together like they have so far! So, now that I&#039;ve totally jinxed the design, here&#039;s the prelim. blurb...

Sniper: Eyes on Target is a cooperative game for 1-2 players. Each person plays a sniper or data-collecting spotter working as a team in Afghanistan. Together, players attempt to secure a hostile combat zone by eliminating high value targets while remaining undetected. As the sniper, you’ll have to collect targeting info from your spotter to avoid civilians, ensure the scope is “dialed-in” correctly, and make the long ranged kill shot. Sound-mask your shot and clear a path for friendly ground forces to advance and verify your kills &amp; secure locations. Additionally, The spotter can direct squad movement, laser-mark locations for Close Air Support, or recon for hidden enemy sniper &amp; mortar teams.

Your mission objectives will vary, but as a highly skilled team of long-range marksmen, the fundamental goal remains: Terminate high value &amp; immediate threat targets while avoiding detection!

or just stay low! :p

	<body>First play of this game for my [listitem=4339107]10×10 Challenge[/listitem].

Decided to try the [thread=1321199][u]Gate To The Museum variant[/u][/thread]. Takes a little extra work to set-up, but I really like the concept. How good is the variant? Well...I never once actually managed to get a gate to the Museum to open, so I can&#039;t say. I&#039;ll have to try it again!

[b]&quot;Skids&quot; O&#039;Toole[/b] and [b]Jenny Barnes[/b] investigated the mystery of [b]Chatanothoa[/b]. Skids managed to pick up a Sheldon Gang membership right away and was by far the MVP of the game. Jenny had a much harder time of it, although she managed to eventually acquire a Silver Lodge membership. While they never managed to gain entry to Arkham Museum, they did manage to resolve several portals, while avoiding being devoured by The Great Old One.


[u]Final Score[/u]:

Elder Signs 10/10
Doom Tokens: 2/9



[b]EDIT 1[/b] :goo:
Took another stab at the [thread=1321199]Gate To The Museum variant[/thread] tonight.

[b]Carolyn Fern[/b] and [b]Darrell Simmons[/b] investigated the mystery of [b]Yibb-Tstll[/b]. It was fairly touch-and-go the whole adventure, but near the end they stumbled upon an otherworldly gate that led into Arkham Museum and they were able to finish the ritual to seal the Great Old One away forever.


[u]Final Score[/u]:

Elder Signs: 12/12
Doom Tokens: 6/12</body>

	<body>This should have been sold as a microgame at a much lower price point, a la Love Letter. This should not have been expanded to a deck of fifty-some cards, not because things are necessarily unbalanced (although now it is entirely possible to get a tableau of near planets that produce no wealth, spiking your game into the ground and you won&#039;t even know it for a while) but because the game now costs too much for the amount of game play in it. 

I find it unfortunate that it arrives with too few cubes in each color to cover (buy) all the technologies while tracking your metal, wealth, and military.  

And the words &quot;Year one: remove one event card, Year two: remove two event cards&quot; on the technology mat isn&#039;t even relevant unless you&#039;re stripping the game down to its original 18 cards, which most people won&#039;t do. That the text was left there is inexplicable to me.  

I would have enjoyed this at a price point of $10 than at the MSRP of $35. As it was, the money not only could have gone into a game that was worth more to me as a gamer, but this game is such that I&#039;m unlikely to be able to sell it or trade it. 

I&#039;ve essentially paid $35 for 50-some card backers and cubes for some other PnP I create. Disappointing to say the very least. </body>

	<body>My first SGOYT item :)

When I first saw this game I knew I had to make it. Sleek visuals, cyberpunk theme, plenty of nods to great works, and free (as in both beer and freedom).

I built it several months ago, and it&#039;s pretty much been sitting around.

I have a fair bit of downtime at work at the moment, so I was able to set it up. This is the first time in a long time that I&#039;ve played both sides of a multiplayer, but it isn&#039;t so bad. I just don&#039;t look at the hand once the cards been re-dealt at the end of the turn.

The game seems to have a lot of luck, both in drawing the coveted [i]Icebreaker[/i] cards, and in rolling dice, but I&#039;ve found I&#039;ve been having fun. I wish the designer gave us the sequel he was developing, that looked k-rad.

The game&#039;s still going (I&#039;ll finish tomorrow), and orange is looking pretty strong, though pink has picked up a few pawns to control, so it will be fun to see how it plays out.

Here&#039;s a pic from relatively early in

[imageid=2870473 medium]

You may notice [thing=90870]Uluru (aka Pelican Cove)[/thing] in the background. I&#039;m thinking about possibly running a solo challenge if anyone is interested.


Edit...

Finished the game this morning, Pink had a surprising resurgence, and managed to get the right cards (not to mention being able to use her cleaner to cause some havoc on orange. Orange just didn&#039;t seem to get many good cards, a few turns were pretty much just spent recycling cards hoping that the next turn would have some icebreakers

Here&#039;s a pic at game end:

	<body>Last night I played Tom&#039;s solo variant that I found on the forums for the original version of TtA.

[thread=465811][/thread]

This may well have helped keep the game in my collection.  The SoloPlay variant is good, but requires a lot of set up and Tom&#039;s is simpler to manage.  Using this variant, you turn over 4 random Age III events (plus Impact of Strength) which are used for the end game scoring.  Then you manage just Culture and strength for the AI through the game. Military cards are handled by dealing a number to the AI and acting on what is drawn.  It&#039;s a teeny teeny bit like the robot from RftG because it&#039;s abstracted away from managing a second player (and you need to keep it out of a produce loop!).  

There are varying difficulty levels which manage how quickly the AI &#039;produces&#039; Culture.  Last night I played the Medium difficulty and won 202-175, so next up is Hard which will make it militarily stronger and produce more culture per &#039;Production&#039; action.

The only negative I can see is I need to learn to play quicker - I ended up going to bed much later than I planned, but I needed to finish the game!</body>

Another good game of this tricky little card drafting, economic, spatial puzzle, golf course building game using the [filepage=112055]fan made but designer approved solo variant[/filepage].

Basically you purchase resources (sand, water, forestry), draft to your hand: the designs for holes (Pars 3,4,5)/VP cards/income boosting cards and then pay to develop the course before the deck cycles through.

The spatial element comes in placing your tee cards so that the entry exit areas line up and that the loop back around to join the club house.  Once a card has been placed, it can never be moved.

I cocked up a bit on this part and ended up way too far from the club house, it cost me a decent score.  Scored 26 (Sultan of Swing) by the rules as written but my personal variant it was only an 8 (Bogey Man) - basically I additionally deduct the distance the last hole ends away from the club house (I was 18 golf balls away).  The usual rule is a sliding scale of only adding points (i.e. +3 VPs if you are at distance 1-5, +0 VPS if over distance 10).

:thumbsup: Fun, quick, and a tiny box
:thumbsdown: High score only but I would consider a completed course reaching the clubhouse as a massive WIN, if it ever happened :shake:
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: I would love to see a complete graphic re-design of this

	<body>Off work with the lurgy today :yuk: but I&#039;ve been cheered up by the arrival of a box of goodies from amazon.de, including this quick little card game. Had 3 attempts, and almost managed a win on my 3rd attempt:
[imageid=2870571]

Nice little game. It gave me a feeling similar to playing [thing=147590][/thing] and games like that, where you set up a move and get to go &#039;I&#039;ll play this, then this, then go back 10, play this and then this&#039;. You essentially have 4 stacks, 2 ascending from 1 and 2 descending from 100. If you play a number exactly 10 away you can push the descent/ascent back by 10 which makes it easier to play future cards, and the idea is to finish all 4 pies with the minimum number of cards left in your hand/the stack. Don&#039;t know how often I&#039;ll crack it out solo but it was a balm to my lurgy-addled brain this morning. I think it should be a nice little filler that I can get out with non-gamers :)

:thumbsup: Dead cheap and plays quick
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Push your luck to some extent, but short enough that it&#039;s hard to mind
:thumbsdown: Theme is thinner than the card it&#039;s printed on (I&#039;ve got no idea what&#039;s going on, there&#039;s skulls and sinister font all over the shop but it&#039;s literally just a numbers game)</body>

	<body>[u][b]Session 1[/b][/u]
(Egypt Campaign, session 5)

[b]Score: 62[/b]
Conquered Province: Great Plains

Event: Disturbances

Achievements:
University
Travelling Circus
Coliseum
Free Trade

Provinces:
Islands
Misty Mtns
Ancient Ruins
Coastal Shores

I’d started this Egyptian campaign months ago and then somehow never got the game back to the table.  Fortunately, I had everything tracked on a spreadsheet and I was able to jump right back in.  This would be the fifth session of the campaign; the first four had gone extraordinarily well.

The event this time was a doozy, however: “Disturbances” which added 15 “disturbance points” for every raze token used.  At game’s end, the player must have more VPs than disturbance points, or lose a province.  In practice, this meant I had to be very cautious about using raze tokens in the early going.  As it turned out, I only used two for the entire game.  I could have used at least one more, but I frankly kind of put razing out of my mind as a tool for the entire session.

Upkeep for my conquered provinces slowed me down in this session; it’s starting to add up even with the improvement modifications I’ve picked up.  The steady resource drain prevent the construction of a few additional cards I could otherwise have completed.

I was helped immensely by drawing two pyramids in my starting hand, and pulling the third in round two.  Having these up for most of the session is the primary reason I was able to do so well without razing.  I think my score of 62 is pretty respectable given the event effect.

My peoples conquered the Great Plains as a reward, which province lets me start each future game with +1 common card.  This very nice benefit comes with steep cost of 10 VP, though.  I had just enough VP remaining after paying the ongoing cost to purchase a wood warehouse — the Egyptians are always short of wood, so I thought this would help, particularly since two of my provinces require wood for per turn upkeep.


[b][u]Session 2:[/u][/b]

(Egypt campaign, session 6)

[b]Score: 50[/b]
Event: Quarantine
Conquered Province: Old Forest

Achievements:
University
Travelling Circus
Coliseum
Free Trade
Wood Warehouse

Provinces:
Islands
Misty Mtns
Ancient Ruins
Coastal Shores
Great Plains

For this second session of the night, I continued my Egyptian campaign with a sixth go-round. While the Quarantine event was not a huge deal in the game (with Egypt, I’m usually spending gold to make deals anyway), and failure to complete the quest simply means doing without border faction cards in the next session.  I decided this was something I could live with since I don’t make more than one or two deals in these campaign sessions anyway.

I got no pyramids at all for the entire session, and I missed them.  I could not get an efficient production engine going and was thus more dependent on deals that I otherwise prefer.  Province upkeep was also a bigger problem with fewer resources coming in.  I did get a deal for raze tokens and razed more than I usually do to make up the production shortfall.  But this cut down on potential foundations for faction cards, which had a domino effect on my construction.  50 points was not a very good score, and after paying province costs, did not leave me with enough to purchase an improvement.

I did conquer the Old Forest, however, which produces much-needed wood without any per turn upkeep.  This should help me get going in future sessions.</body>

	<body>I have to admit, after playing [thing=124839]The Lost Cities[/thing] 5+ times, I was starting to have a bit of buyer&#039;s remorse.  I like it but the game felt too repetitive.  At the advise of others I opened up Rise of Rome and played the easiest Titan, Menoetius.  Wow!!!  Now this is the game I was looking for with my investment.  The Titans are much more interesting than facing off with the bosses.  I love how the crowd favor works and how exciting is it to actually be able to earn the CF Gladiator!  Fantastic game.  If you are wondering, I was able to take down the Titan on my first try.  Although, I mistakenly cheated initially having the Titan moving to an inactive shard rather than the champion.  Then somehow there were 4 straight rounds that the Titan could not move or attack due to die rolls.  What are the odds of that black die rolling a blank 4 times in a row (1/1296)?

[imageid=2870777 medium]

:thumbsup: Crowd favor system is so much better than TLC.
:thumbsup: non-health chips are a delight to handle.  I&#039;m tempted to buy  the premium replacements.
:thumbsdown: box size does not make for easy storage on the shelf.</body>

	<body>Two games with Dexter Drake (magician) and Michael Mc Glen (the gangster) against Azathoth (14 Elder Signs required, 12 doom tokens).

Much smoother with two investigators than previously with a single one. In the first game Azathoth was repelled with 9 doom tokens, investigators never lost much momentum.

Second game was more difficult (I used the following variant to ramp up the difficulty: discard all 8 mythos cards with a &quot;unless&quot; condition) .
Initial adventure cards were difficult and investigators quickly lost their items. Both investigators were killed, and Azathoth&#039;s doom track was filling rather quickly at 10/12. But completing two other world cards brought the 5 missing Elder Signs.

Next I will start playing with the Gate of Arkham expansion.</body>

	<body>I picked this up after watching The Elemeeple review. I was a big fan of [thing=75725][/thing] back in the day and saw some interesting correlations of having to manage both the finances and work-flow of a hospital.  

I have a couple plays under my belt already before February, but I am still no veteran of strategy for this one. My first play through ended in disaster as I had five people die before the 3rd round. Another game ended as quickly due to my inexplicably deciding to just skip the part where I get paid for curing people. Eventually I finished a full game, but with a pitiful score. And yet, I am having a total blast with this game as it lives up to all my expectations.  

Here is my latest game after 1 round. I seem to start off every game with at least one death.
[ImageID=2870937 medium]

:thumbsup: Oozes theme like a pulsating wound.
:thumbsup: Brilliant RNG system using colored cubes instead of dice. The brilliant part is that cubes are not returned allowing you to see what has come up and build a strategy to play the odds of what is left to come up.
:thumbsdown: Although I am not colorblind, the color cube mechanic might be difficult for those that are. 

Final thoughts:
I know some people are put off by solo games that are really co-ops in which you play all sides. This one does not feel like you are playing multiple characters. Each doctor is given two action points, so in a sense this game is just allowing you to use six action points instead of two when playing solo. There is even a variant in which you just use one doctor with six actions. The theme just great, as I feel the chaos of getting patients in and healed quickly. No patient can be left too long unattended. The scoring system at this point for me is secondary to just getting through the shift (perhaps because I still find it challenging). On a minor note, the theme is also refreshing over my less than diverse zombie infested gaming library. This has quickly elevated to my current favorite game. Thanks for putting it on my radar, Ava!

	<body>All the talk about the the cup racing and the like made me want to try this through Vassal, just to see if I&#039;d like it.

I played the January track for practice.  I didn&#039;t track my individual rolls as I was concentrating on rules (and alt-tabbing back to my job :blush: ).

My finishing time was 5 minutes 23 seconds.  Probably a lousy time, especially since I did a Time Attack with 4 dice as my opening and rolled 3 !&#039;s and fell off the track.  Guess I needed to ease off the clutch a little more.

Never fell off the track after that, but never did anything too crazy either.

My overall impression was pretty &quot;meh.&quot;  Sure, when I compare it to everyone else and I can start hurling insults at people, that part would be fun, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;ll be something I spend too much brainpower on.</body>

	<body>As I did last month several times, I got 2 plays of this in today on my lunch break.

I decided on keeping shorthand notes of both plays. Perhaps this will help someone on the fence about this game or someone will spot a nice play or egregious error I made.

[size=18]Hostage Negotiator vs. Arkayne #1[/size]
[b]Conversation 1:[/b] Started off with &quot;What Are Your Demands?&quot; and rolled 0 Successes. Threat Level (TL) now = 5
	Played the second &quot;What Are Your Demands?&quot; and rolled poorly again, this time with a 4 however. I discarded &quot;Small Talk&quot; &amp; &quot;Keep Cool&quot; to turn it into a success. I revealed that Arkayne&#039;s Major Demand was &quot;Supply of Weapons&quot; and chose to end the conversation.
	I bought nothing (zero Conversation Points (CP)) 
	Terror card was &quot;Don&#039;t Test Me&quot; and my roll was lower than the TL of 5, so 1 Hostage was killed.
----- 6 Hostages in the pool / 1 Hostage dead / TL = 5 -----
[b]Conversation 2:[/b] Played &quot;Keep Cool&quot; and rolled 1 Success; TL -1 = 4
	&quot;Small Talk&quot;; 0 successes; +1 CP and the conversation is ended.
	I bought a &quot;What I Meant Was...&quot;
	Terror was &quot;I&#039;m Getting Angry&quot;; TL +2 = 6
----- 6 H in pool / 1 H dead / TL = 6 -----
[b]Conversation 3:[/b] &quot;Keep Cool&quot;; Rolled 4 &amp; 4; Discarded both &quot;Demand&quot; cards for 1 Success; TL -1 = 5
	&quot;Small Talk&quot;; 1 Success; +2 CP &amp; chose to end the conversation
	Bought &quot;Just Stay Calm&quot;
	Terror was &quot;The Situation is Worsening&quot;; TL +1 &amp; +1 for my unrevealed demand = K
----- 6 H in pool / 1 H dead / TL = K -----
[b]Conversation 4:[/b] &quot;Just Stay Calm&quot;; 0 successes; played &quot;What I Meant Was&quot; and re-rolled one die for 1 Success; TL -1 = 6
	&quot;Keep Cool&quot;; 1 Success; TL -1 = 5
	&quot;Small Talk&quot;; 1 Success; +2 CP = 2 &amp; chose to end here.
	Bought &quot;Just a Few More Minutes&quot;
	Terror was &quot;Im Growing Impatient&quot; (draw the next red Terror card); &quot;Looks Like We&#039;re Back to Square One&quot;; TL reset to starting value (4)
----- 6 H in pool / 1 H dead / TL = 4 -----
[b]Conversation 5:[/b] &quot;What Are Your Demands?&quot;; 2 Successes; Revealed Escape Demand was a Helicopter; +2 CP = 2
	&quot;Just a Few More Minutes&quot;; 1 Success; TL +1 = 5 &amp; +3 CP = 5
	&quot;Small Talk&quot;; Rolled 3 &amp; 4, but decided to let it go; +1 CP = 6 &amp; Conversation is over
	Bought &quot;Bold Lie&quot; &amp; &quot;Just Stay Calm&quot;
	Terror was &quot;Minor Demand: Water&quot;
----- 6 H in pool / 1 H dead / TL = 5 -----
[b]Conversation 6:[/b] I conceded the Water for 1 extra die this conversation.
	&quot;Bold Lie&quot;; 1 Success; TL -1 = 4 &amp; +1 CP = 1
	&quot;Keep Cool&quot;; Rolled 644 on the three dice, but left it 1 Success; TL -1 = 3 
	&quot;Just Stay Calm&quot;; Rolled 643 and discarded &quot;What Are Your Demands?&quot; &amp; &quot;Small Talk&quot; to make it 2 Successes; TL -2 = 1
	Now I have 4 dice, so I played &quot;Keep Cool&quot;; I rolled 4421!!; No way to modify it, so 0 Successes; -1 CP = 0 and Conversation is ended. Drat!
	Bought nothing of course
	Terror was &quot;This is Going Nowhere&quot;; 1 H killed
----- 5 H in pool / 2 H dead / TL = 1 -----
[b]Conversation 7:[/b] &quot;Small Talk&quot;; 2 Successes; +3 CP = 3 &amp; I chose to end here.
	Bought &quot;Minor Extraction&quot;
	Terror was &quot;The Situation is Getting Worse&quot;; TL +1 = 2
----- 5 H in pool / 2 H dead / TL = 2 -----
[b]Conversation 8:[/b] &quot;Keep Cool&quot;; 2 Successes; TL -1 = 1 &amp; +1 CP = 1
	&quot;Keep Cool&quot;; 2 Successes; TL -1 = S &amp; _1 CP = 2
	&quot;Minor Extraction&quot;; 1 Success; 1 H freed &amp; TL +1 = 1. I chose to end this conversation at this point.
	Bought &quot;Just a Few More Minutes&quot;
	Terror was &quot;Time is Running Out&quot;. I only had one more Red Terror card after this one which instructs you to discard half of the remaining Red cards, rounded down. I played this that half of one rounded down is zero and I&#039;m pretty sure that is correct.
----- 4 H in pool / 2 H dead / 1 H freed / TL = 1 -----
[b]Conversation 9:[/b] &quot;Just a Few More Minutes&quot;; Rolled 223!; TL +2 = 3 &amp; Conversation is ended

----- 5 H in pool / 2 H dead / 1 H freed / TL =3 -----
[b]Conversation 10:[/b] It all went South here... &quot;Small Talk&quot;; 0 successes; +1 CP &amp; Conversation is over.
	Bought &quot;What I meant Was&quot;
	Terror was the Pivotal that says &quot;You may not acquire the zero-point cost cards for the rest of the game.&quot; OUCH! I only had one out anyway.
----- 5 H in pool / 2 H dead / 1 H freed / TL = 3 -----
[b]LAST Conversation:[/b] Discarded 2 &quot;Keep Cool&quot; for +2 CP = 2
	&quot;Small Talk&quot;; 2 Successes; +3 CP = 5

Whenever I have a spare 1/2 hour I just pull this out and go through it again.  I gotta say, having McGee (the Medic) and Maj Godwinson (lets you return Disorganized cards to stock) are Really, REALLY good.

...and coming up against StuGs, MG and Flak 88s are Really REALLY bad.

Thankfully, the Good Guys won this time.</body>

	<body>[i]It was the day Dolonar had been waiting for his whole life:  he was finally going to sit in the cockpit of his very own T-70 X-Wing without a trainer looking over his shoulder.  The only thing he&#039;d ever wanted to do was pilot an X-Wing, and a great sense of elation poured over him as he marched proudly onto the landing field toward the ship.

Dreams and visions flooded his mind.  He was going to be as good as Poe Dameron; better even!  Maybe even as good a pilot as Luke Skyw-

[b]&quot;Alert!  Alert!  Enemy ships incoming!  All pilots to their ships, on the double!  Prepare to mount a defense!&quot;[/b]

Breaking into an all-out sprint, he clambered into the cockpit and fired up the engines, forgetting to ensure his droid was installed.  Lifting off the ground, he punched the thrusters and shot out into the sky above the planet, eyes scanning the horizon for signs of the First Order.

[b]&quot;Blue Squadron Novice Dolonar reporting for duty,&quot;[/b] he said over his comms, but before the squadron leader could issue him orders, his ship was shot out of the sky and the First Order&#039;s TIE fighters screamed past the Resistance base, ducking and weaving between the blasts of the surface-to-air-cannon fire.  Dolonar initiated pursuit of the two TIE fighters, readying his guns and firing up his shields.

He&#039;d studied the maneuvers of his enemy over and over most nights while he was in Academy and quickly recognized that the TIEs were from the Epsilon and Zeta squadrons.  Some fancy flying of his own helped him get them separated from each other to try to whittle them down one at a time.

[center][imageid=2871439 medium][/center]


He knew the TIE pilots were trained such that their agility on the battle field was unmatched by his own, but he had the superior firing skill and it was only a matter of time.

A close call with the Zeta pilot put him on edge, and he knew the Zeta realized he&#039;d endanger himself attempting to fire at such close quarters.

[center][imageid=2871457 medium][/center]


As the battle raged on, Dolonar&#039;s skill behind the controls revealed the Epsilon pilot was no match for him, and though he&#039;d taken a few hits to knock out his shields, he was going to go home victorious.

The Epsilon was in his sights; he fired!  A direct hit with both cannons!  The TIE ship exploded into a bright ball of flame and rubble, and Dolonar&#039;s fervor was reignited.  Only one more to go...

[center][imageid=2871468 medium][/center]


Dolonar knew the Zeta pilot outclassed him with skills behind the controls, but he was determined.  A thought popped into his head he&#039;d never thought before:  perhaps he could use the Force after all.  He calmed his nerves, concentrated, and closed his eyes to help him feel what was around him.  

Then he did something he&#039;d only heard them talk about in Academy.  They said it was the hardest maneuver to negotiate; that only the most skilled pilots could manage to do it.  They didn&#039;t teach it in Academy for that reason: you needed to have too many pilot hours in the books to be able to make a Koiogran Turn.  But without any training or knowledge, Dolonar executed the K turn with the utmost precision.

Opening his eyes, Dolonar saw in front of him the Zeta pilot, ship facing away and preparing to bank around for a killing blow against the novice X-Wing pilot.

He fired his cannons.

[center][imageid=2871476 medium][/center]


The blast from the explosion rocked his ship a little as he flew through all that remained of the TIE fighter:  rubble.  He had done it.  Relief washed over him and he angled his ship back toward the base.  

It was the best day of Dolonar&#039;s life.  His dream had come true and he was a real X-Wing pilot finally.  He couldn&#039;t help but wonder what else the future held for him.[/i]</body>

	<body>Challenge 1 this month made me wonder if any of my library had hearts.  A  couple do; Hoplomachus, Tiny Epic Defenders, but I also realised Bowl-Sol hadn&#039;t been played for a while.  When logging the entry &#039;a while&#039; turned out to be nearly a year.

8 Plays with scores ranging between 89 &amp; 147.  

The final game was shaping up to be a Personal Worst - 71pts going into the 10th, then got Strike-Strike-6, finishing on 97.  Not a great score overall, but a nice come-back all the same.

[b]Update[/b]
8 more plays over the last couple of days with much better scores; Min 103 &amp; Max 157.

In these plays there were 12 Spares, 12 Strikes, a Double &amp; a Turkey.</body>

Time for more fun play testing [company=8007][/company][b] A Near Run Thing[/b], 2nd in Death or Glory Series started by [thing=124622][/thing].  Today was mostly Death, but it turned into Glory.

I tried the Full Attack this time, a 9 battalion attack.  Perhaps counter intuitively, the 9 battalion attack is harder to pull off than the 6 battalion attack.  The terrain is rougher, and while you have more battalions, they are not necessarily stronger.

I was rolling really poorly, a battalion would be trying for the last obstacle before bayonet combat, and get 2 retreats, or the dreaded die roll of :d6-1::bd6-1:, which sends you all the way back to your Rally marker.   ..and I never move my Rally markers up, I prefer to get my Cohesion Value and Strength Value back up first.  So of course my gamble did NOT pay off.

By the end of the game, 4 of 9 battalions overran British positions, but the points earned only got me to the Standstill victory level.  However, if the Prussians do not enter the game, the French gets boosted one level, in my case, to Victory.  Go French!</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve started my solo Super Bowl play of the Denver Broncos vs. the AI-run Carolina Panthers.

The game started with Denver getting the ball.  On the third play of the game one of Manning&#039;s long passes was intercepted.  Carolina was not able to move the ball (they actually lost two yards), so punted.  Denver then engineered a long drive, helped by a 47-yard pass, but the drive stalled at the Carolina 23.  On third and long, Manning was sacked.  So Denver settled for a field goal.  Score:

Denver 3, Carolina 0.

In the second quarter, Carolina started moving the ball, and made it all the way down to the Denver 5 yard line.  But then, the ghost of Russel Wilson appeared and Newton threw an interception into the end zone.  After a trade of punts, Denver got moving again with the long pass and scored a a perfectly-thrown short pass (the yards gained moved the ball to the 0 yard line).  With the PAT (now a 15-yard field goal), it was

Denver 10, Carolina 0.

With the second quarter winding down, Carolina&#039;s running game got into gear.  Play after play, I expected pass and the AI ran, though in my mind a lot of those yards came from Newton&#039;s scrambling or outright running.  I tried switching up my defense, but then Carolina started passing and they were able to score a touchdown with one minute to go in the half.  

So score at the half:

Denver 10, Carolina 7.

Stay tuned....

	<body>Set this game up yesterday, and got in about an hour last night and another hour and a half tonight. I incorporated the Seekers of a Hidden Light expansion, which adds quests - a very enjoyable aspect of the game. They help to provide a little more direction when first starting out, and make looking for encounters worth more than just some soul shards (those Lux potions are potent!).

The game started off well enough, and wanting to really try out the expansion I had all four avatars pick up a quest. The shadow in the Shadow realm was slow and plodding, never reaching an unsealed gate. The time spent there made it very powerful, however (8 or 9 life tokens), which made me nervous. Fortunately, an item I had received allow me to destroy a shadow in the shadow realm and seal up Xd* gates, where X was the life total. All gates sealed. Crisis averted.

Moving along, the journey became more of a slog: lair after lair of unusable equipment left the avatars sorely underpowered for taking on any of the Guardians. Then the second shadow broke free. Once again, I was able to use an item (potion) to completely destroy this manifestation, though all the gates were unsealed yet again. 

After exhausting the rest of the lairs, despite still not having ample equipment (even with the lux potions) I felt the need to press onto the Guardians. Fool&#039;s errand. I lost one (already weakened) avatar in one fell strike, and the other just barely made it out alive. Another shadows escaped the shadow realm, and bee-lined for an unrevealed well. It managed to open the well, and Xulthul arrived. I couldn&#039;t stand against him. My avatars were all separated, having fled various battles, and moved too quickly for them to catch anyway. He ended up revealing the last light well (conveniently one the same hex board as the first), issuing in a new reign of Shadow. 

Lovely.</body>

	<body>[i](My first post on SGOYT – woohoo!)

These are the events of the final (1942) game turn in my recent play of the base game of[/i] [thing=179918]The Producer: 1940-1944[/thing].  [i]I’m using my[/i] [filepage=127564]Hollywood Confidential[/filepage] [i]solo rules which pit the player against legendary producer David O. Selznick ([/i]Gone With the Wind[i], etc.) and his “one man film industry”, Selznick International Pictures.  At the end of the 1941 turn the score was Selznick 11, me 9.

Before I begin, I’ve gotta tell you that [/i]The Producer: 1940-1944[i] has a more profuse implementation of theme than any game I’ve ever seen.  Amazingly, everything in this account comes directly out of the gameplay. . . [/i]

[floatleft][ImageID=2686524large][center][i]You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard . . .[/i][/center][/floatleft][b]1941 had ended on a high note for me.[/b]  My film [i]A Guy Named Joe[/i], last year’s surprise box office hit (due in no small part to the public’s appetite for war flicks since Pearl Harbor), landed Frank Capra the Oscar for Best Director, and my studio now has a lot more cash reserves than Selznick.  However, I’m a little nervous that my Mob ties may cause me more problems this year than just having to cast Don Vito’s girlfriend in another production.

Of course, Selznick’s going to have to pay the cops another $200,000 this year for protection after he refused that same boss’s offer of “help”.  But he’s got a nice stable of talent under contract over there, and a number of top-notch scripts.  We both expect our audience numbers may be down this year, with a number of able-bodied men overseas in the service, and others occupied with the war effort on the home front.

Selznick’s cash flow problems wind up hitting him real hard at the start of the year.  (They sure weren’t helped when his last flick of ’41, [i]Dr. Cyclops[/i], laid a real egg at the box office – after he’d spent big bucks on building a second soundstage and a special effects unit for the production.)  So he’s got to mortgage a number of those buildings just to stay afloat [i][[i]using up a precious Producer action to do so, out of the 6 he has available for the game turn[/i]][/i]; lucky for him that also provides him enough cash to keep all his talent under contract for the year.

To start this year I decide to put together a big ad campaign.  Hopefully this will help me reach more of the demographic I’ll be pitching my films to throughout the year (basically, everyone except the kiddies), and should help my Oscar chances as well.

Selznick makes use of a second-unit director and both of his soundstages to produce a blockbuster [i][[i]called a “Kolossal” in the game[/i]][/i].  He has Michael Curtiz directing Humphrey Bogart and Hedy Lamarr in [i]The Sea Hawk[/i] [i][and since Curtiz and character actor Claude Rains worked on the actual movie in real life, that makes this adventure flick a Best Picture Oscar contender][/i].  Swedish-born actress Signe Hasso is reunited with Curtiz, one of her favorite directors as he’s also a European ex-pat, so her performance may also get her an Oscar nod.  It turns out to be a box office smash, drawing on the huge fan base of its male and female leads, as well as a broad cross-section of men, women and teenagers.  Critics like it too, and their favorable reviews attract even more moviegoers.  The film brings in $2.6 million in revenues to Selznick International Pictures – quite a turnaround after they’d been down to their last $60,000 before its release.

Fortunately for me, the press has found some correspondence from Selznick star Bela Lugosi implicating him as a Nazi sympathizer, so he may prove to be box office poison in any of their future productions.  For myself, I’d like to diversify my genre output as much as possible [i][[i]the more genres you produce, the more extra victory points you get[/i]][/i].  However, I’ll need to raise more cash to devote resources to construction of some specialized facilities to do it, so I decide to just put out another drama to fill some seats.  With director Frank Capra at the helm, my production of [i]White Cliffs of Dover[/i] looks like it has some legs – and that’s not just due to rising star Elizabeth Taylor getting some good notices.  Despite a big ad campaign, the film’s initial take at the box office is disappointing; but with generally positive reviews it gathers momentum, and finishes up doing a respectable $1.6 million in business.

Now that Selznick is flush with cash, he decides to go back to the bank to pay off those mortgages [i][[i]you can’t win the game if you have any active mortgages at the end of the last turn[/i]][/i].[floatright][ImageID=2703644large][center][i]If I build it, will they come?[/i][/center][/floatright]  

I’ve got a script in development for the musical [i]Bathing Beauty[/i], so with some of my recent earnings I decide to build a second soundstage and the orchestra facility I’ll need.  And I’m pleased as punch that two of my biggest stars, Jimmy Stewart and Lauren Bacall, have announced they’re tying the knot – news of their wedding plans should bring plenty of fans to see their next picture. 

It turns out Selznick’s going for diversity too, and he rush-releases a B-Movie production of [i]Heaven Can Wait[/i] so he’ll have a comedy to his credit.  The film, livened up by a hilarious pie fight sequence, brings in $1.2 million - though nobody will remember it at Oscar time.  

But now I can finally put out that musical.  My obligation to the Mob means I’ve had to cast as the male lead a piano bar singer who Don Vito “discovered” in one of his casinos.  A young Judy Garland co-stars, but everyone’s really coming to see lovebirds Jimmy Stewart and Lauren Bacall, even though they’re just playing supporting roles.  I pull out all the stops for this one, as it could be the last film I put out this year.  I even throw in a slow motion sequence, and have a top-notch editor working on it too.  It racks up $2 million in revenues.

Meanwhile, Selznick’s been sitting on a great script for a thriller called [i]Laura[/i], but he needs to build a noir theme set on his lot to shoot it first.

All the blood drains from my face as I read the headlines in the paper the next morning – the FBI has arrested crime boss Vito Salvatore.  Sure enough, I come under investigation; I wind up spending $500,000 on lawyers to keep me out of the hoosegow.  Undeterred, I put out a casting call and hire some more talent for one final production this year.  Among my new employees are temperamental star Vivien Leigh and veteran director Raoul Walsh.  As a founding member of the Academy, Walsh should bring me some extra sway come Oscar time.  I also build out my entire studio lot, adding a third soundstage, a make-up room and a special effects unit.  [i][[i]Each building gives you victory points, and you also get +5 VP at the end of the game if you’ve completed all available structures at your studio.[/i]][/i]

Selznick needs to hire a director and some players for [i]Laura[/i], so John Huston is brought in to direct Olivia deHavilland and James Cagney (name dropper!).

[floatleft][ImageID=2703641large][center][i]I&#039;d like to thank all the little people for making this award possible[/i][/center][/floatleft]I need to rent out Selznick’s noir theme set to shoot my last film of the year, the thriller [i]The Woman in the Window[/i], so I fork over $300,000 to him for the privilege.  I’m hoping director Alfred Hitchcock’s skill in the genre will earn him an Oscar.  Unfortunately, the film only brings in a paltry $600,000 at the box office – it seem most of the adult moviegoing public has already seen its quota of films for the year.  I knew I should’ve looked for some kid-friendly scripts!

Seeing my thriller tank at the box office, Selznick plows ahead with his, as he doesn’t have any scripts remaining in any diverse genres.  He brings in a talented art director to work on [i]Laura[/i] to try to appeal to a younger crowd, but winds up with only $400,000 in ticket sales.  With the war having depleted the potential audience, it seems the public is staying away in droves.

But who cares – it’s Oscar night!  All the stars in the Hollywood firmament are out for the presentation of this year’s Academy Awards.  And the Oscar for Best Picture goes to . . . Selznick International Pictures for [i]The Sea Hawk[/i] (drat!).  Best Director is between Michael Curtiz for [i]The Sea Hawk[/i] and Alfred Hitchcock for my production of [i]The Woman in the Window[/i].  Hitch gets it!  Spencer Tracy takes Best Actor honors for my production of [i]The White Cliffs of Dover[/i], and his young co-star Elizabeth Taylor gets the Oscar for Best Actress.  [i][[i]At this point I’ve just pulled into a tie with Selznick for victory points![/i]][/i]  And with some behind the scenes help influencing Academy voters, young singing sensation Judy Garland wins Best Supporting Actor/Actress for her role in my musical [i]Bathing Beauty[/i]. [i] [[i]I’m ahead![/i]][/i]

[i]Too bad though, my hopes for victory are dashed, as Selznick’s greater production diversity (putting out seven different genres of films to my six) allows him to eke out a 53-49 win.  But what a finish![/i]

	<body>2P Solo

I couldn&#039;t decide which two to use this time around, so I flipped all the boards over, mixed them up, and randomly chose...  Knight vs. Thief.

With all the little tweaks that have been made to the rules, cards, and abilities and such over the past few months, this felt like the most balanced match-up between these two yet.   They had an almost perfect back-and-forth trade between points scored, with the Thief stashing a treasure every time the Knight smashed a crystal or vice-versa.
[imageid=2871837 medium]
Hitting the Knight early on (and a second time later) with the Strength-loss backstab slowed her down just enough for the Thief to take the lead, and while she did manage to tie it back up in the closing rounds, this game belonged to the Thief.   

Eight tiles remained in the Cave stack, so there was still plenty of time remaining before the collapse would have become a threat.</body>

	<body>Was getting sleepy, almost ready to call it a night, but I couldn&#039;t remember if there was something I was... CRAP! Deadline for [listitem=4319956]Hole #5 in the Predator Golf challenge[/listitem] is today!

So I threw it out on the table. No practice run, nothing - set it up and went to work, drawing a random Predator for my avatar. Primeval Hunter? Sure, why not!

Actually did pretty well for about 2/3 of the game - killed a lot of stuff in the wilds, saving the 2-honor cards for the Combat Zone so I&#039;d get the points. Then once the Worthy Prey started making appearances, I started getting traps by the truckload, thanks to a couple of untimely Gear cards (Sonic Lure, rot in hell) combined with the abilities on the Prey cards.

In the end, we cleared out most of them while taking, believe it or not, very little damage or dishonor, and cheesing the Killer Instinct cards to thin the deck. (I&#039;d been able to pull off a couple of Restores along the way too). I didn&#039;t quite get enough heavy hitting cards in the armory, though, so I was looking at an average damage per hand of maybe 8-9 by the end.

So of course, when Dutch makes his appearance, his Gear card is a Submachine Gun, raising his attack from 9 to 12. He gets to the Combat Zone, then kills me with his first strike. Yaaaaaaaay.

So I probably can&#039;t complain, since I didn&#039;t practice at all - ended up with a probably-not-too-good 14 points and death by Schwarzenegger.</body>

[size=18][b]Ouch![/b][/size]

Tried the first mission of the core deck in Easy Mode, to remember how to play, after not playing this in a very long time. I had a pretty good deck with Gimli, Glorfindel, and Beravor for another scenario. Did not work so well in this scenario.

[b]Location MADNESS![/b]
One evil spider and 5 locations made the scenario impassable. There was just too much location threat to counter, with no Willpower to get through the gridlock of locations.

	<body>[b]1 February[/b]

[i]The Cavalary[/i] - the Viet Cong move to find and capture the American air crew of a CH-46 helicopter while a hastily mobilized force of New Zealanders rushes in to rescue the Americans.

WO2 Lovell takes two of his squads and moves double time northwest across a large brush covered hill toward the Americans. The other two Kiwi squads move west and skirt the southern edge of the hill along a wide trail. His scout moves to skirt the brush covered hill to the north. Meanwhile Arnat leads seven squads of VC equipped with a BAR northeast toward the American crew. The VC she leads are little more than farmers armed with AK-47s and they move cautiously and slowly the first two turns.

On turn 3 Arnat knows both the Americans and the New Zealanders are close. With some encouragement her troops pick up the pace and win the initiative.  She first sends a single squad toward an area of light jungle she expects some of the New Zealanders to be. It&#039;s a gambit as those poor farmers will likely die, but it will allow a couple other squads pinpoint the location of the Kiwis and ambush them with a melee attack. WO2 Lovell takes the bait. As the single VC squad gets close his point man picks up their location. They&#039;re close, very close. When the first couple move into sight he gives the command and both squads open up, wounding and killing some of the VC while the others shake and look for cover. 

The two squads she designated to ambush the Kiwis now rush forward hearing the small arms fire. Because they started out of line of sight of the New Zealanders, they will take advantage of their ability to triple their firepower and inflict casualties first. Instead of concentrating their attack on one squad they try to engage both squads and Lovell. Fortunately for the New Zealanders one of their fire teams on the flank caught sight of the incoming VC and shouted a warning. The Kiwis shifted their attention from the reduced and shaken squad they were shooting at and turned aggressively to face the new threat. Surprise blown at the last minute, their ambush faltered under the unanticipated fervor of the New Zealander defense. The VC were beat back in close combat, sustaining heavy losses; the few remaining that could move melted back into the jungle and routed. 

The other two Kiwi squads kept moving west and then turned north around the brushy hill. They moved toward a point west of the sound of the small arms fire, hoping to catch a VC flanking or rear guard force by surprise. Instead, Arnat and the two squads in her immediate vicinity got the drop on them. The New Zealanders took heavy fire from those VC and their BAR. Ond squad shook and took cover while the other sustained a couple dead and wounded.

Arnat committed her last two squads to securing the Americans, just one hex north of Lovell&#039;s location. The American air crew was quickly captured by the two VC squads. The Kiwi scout moved west toward the gunfire and climbed the hill while the Medic, who had purposefully hung back a short distance from the two squads who were taking fire directly for Arnat&#039;s squads, moved to rejoin his men, knowing they needed his help.

On turn 4 the New Zealanders gained the initiative, fortunately for the American air crew. The medic was able to rally the whole squad. To the north Lovell rushed his men a short distance north and engaged the squads who had just captured the Americans in melee. With their location pinpointed and unable to avail themselves of their ambush ability, the VC took heavy casualties again. The few that survived and were ambulatory fled quickly, leaving the Americans to their rescuers. 

Pulled in two directions and fearing her men to the northeast were in trouble, Arnat decided to first engage the two Australian squads (one having taken casualties) her men were firing at. Though they would likely face opportunity fire from the rallied squad, she knew her odds in melee would be better and she ordered her squads to advance on the Kiwis they were shooting at. They double timed and made a right hook to approach through some heavy jungle which would afford them more cover. It was for naught, however, and her gamble failed. The rallied squad had anticipated Arnat&#039;s move and were waiting for her as she led her squads through the heavy jungle. At close range, a mere minute or two before they would have been able to enter melee, the two VC squads were cut down by extremely intense fire from the Kiwis. Most were killed or wounded and both squads were combat ineffective. Arnat herself was wounded badly.

The Kiwi scout, with small arms fire raging to his north and south, moved west and came upon the remaining half squad of diversionary VC that Lovell&#039;s men had halted ten minutes prior. Coming out of the jungle stealthily, the scout took out a couple of healthy looking VC. In shock, wounded, and surrounded by their fallen neighbors, the few remaining wounded VC surrendered to him.

On turn 5 Arnat failed to rally and the Kiwis who had thwarted her ambush captured her.

[ImageID=2871940large]

[u]Analysis[/u]
This ended up being an overwhelming victory for New Zealand. They won with a score of 17-1, having suffered only one half squad worth of casualties. I actually thought the game was likely to go to the VC on turn three. Had the VC succeeded in their ambush (they only needed to roll a 7 or higher on 2d6) they would have eliminated Lovell and his two squads, thus basically ensuring a VC win. Though that failed and Lovell&#039;s men responded by wiping out the those two VC squads, they still would have had a decent chance to win had they won the initiative on turn 4 by either fleeing toward Arnat&#039;s squads with the prisoners or by executing them and fleeing. Instead the New Zealanders won the initiative which allowed Lovell to engage the adjacent VC squads holding the Americans captive on the first impulse of turn 4. They were outgunned and were eliminated without causing any casualties among the Kiwis. Thus rescued, and with 4.5 of the 7 VC squads eliminated, Arnat was forced into a bad position of meleeing Lovell&#039;s group or meleeing a the weaker force a couple hexes away.

This scenario was simple like the Friend in Need scenario I&#039;ve been playing. It was a lot of fun to play this rescue/capture scenario. Just a brutal, quick contact scenario. It was nice to use the ANZAC forces as well, as they have slightly different qualities than the Americans.

	<body>And so the campaign ends. After 4 defeats in the previous quests the last one was completely different... I fooled you! I lost again.

This time the defeat was not as bad and it could have been a victory but I used a massive attack (6 hits IIRC) to kill of 2 enemy units (a Black Orc and something else I think) instead of hitting the final Boss.

But I don&#039;t mind as I realized later in the game that I had done a terrible, terrible, mistake. I had forgotten to read the top of the quest card and I cruised through the locations without paying the penalty.

Now that the campaign has ended I have a couple of thoughts. First of all this is a very good, engaging, quick game. Further development of the game, more heros, more abilities, more treasures, etc... will only make the game so much better. It is not what I dreamt of it of being (although fighting is not the only thing you have to do, it is still a major point) but it is still a very good game.

I am having a problem with scaling this game. I think the 2 player (or solo game) is not well scaled. Many items are almost irrelevant for a 2 player game (the ruby that lets you recover 4 actions, if played with 4 players it will see a lot of play but with 2 less so), the locations are harder with 2 players (drawing 4 open enemies means either 1 for each or 2 for each, that is a big change), and the enemies are harder (the skaven engineer will hit both players every turn!).

Will I play this game? Yes, soon. But I will try it with 4 players as I think the 2 player spot is not were it shines.

Also, as a final thought, I think the quest were all too difficult (maybe it is just the scale problem) it would have been nice to have a few changes of pace, some easier missions and some harder missions.

Looking forward to my next game.</body>

	<body>Dominion Empires has just been announced, timely reminding me that I still haven&#039;t managed to play with all the cards from the last set yet (Adventures - which I think is the best expansion set to date). Carting the boxes along to game night (2 boxes full with cards, weighing around 5kg+ each) isn&#039;t always practical, and it doesn&#039;t get to the table as often as I&#039;d like either, so the more recent sets haven&#039;t had a lot of play at all.
There is always Dominion Online, but it doesn&#039;t feel the same, means the physical set doesn&#039;t get any use, and the price point for the expansions is more than I&#039;m willing to pay. So, I decided to look into creating my own solo variant for it that suited my tastes.

Inspiration in part came from my brief reads on automa design[blogpost=37830]in this blog post(s)[/blogpost], and I decided to tackle designing an AI opponent whose actions reflect the important features that human opponents have on your game, rather than playing the of the game itself.

Opponents in Dominion have 2 main impacts on your engine building:
1. They deplete piles, and
2. They play attack cards that interfere with your turns.
They are also necessary for resolving some cards, like thief, pirate ship, tribute, and the like, but that can be tied into point 1 above.

The AI rolls 2xd10. the first d10 represents the &#039;action&#039; that it performs while the second d10 (or d12 if playing with events that can effect you) represents the kingdom card that it buys for the turn.
The AI also has 2 tracks (Economy and Prestige) that effect it&#039;s actions (they improve over time) and what treasure cards/VP cards it acquires.

The AI (v2.3 in this case) looks something like this: (sorry for the bad lighting). Blue is standard behaviour, while red is modified behaviour. Both attack cards and VP generating cards like Monument or Bishop go in the slots at the top of the board, and once there get a chance of being used. As an alternate source of VP cards like monument couldn&#039;t be ignores.
[imageid=2872116 medium]

Then onto testing it.

[imageid=2872117 medium]
All things considered the first kingdom that I used wasn&#039;t very interesting, but it served well for trailing the AI. I grabbed all the provinces in the first game, realising that I hadn&#039;t given the AI enough opportunities to acquire them, and that it didn&#039;t grow quick enough, even taking into account the random nature of the dice rolls. Some quick improvements to the AI, then tried again. 39:24 - much better result, but still too slow. So more improvements.

Changed kingdoms, tested again. Won again, still too slow, though it had much more success with attack cards.

Kingdom #3 for testing:
[imageid=2872123 medium]

This one looked more interesting, and while I won the first game impressively again I felt that it certainly running smoother. Made some minor tweaks, and played again - 23:23. Much better.

So far so good. I am happy with how it is progressing, but it still requires more testing. It is a simple enough AI, at least in my eyes, but there is still many improvements that I could make to it I&#039;m sure. I will continue to work on it as I use it, and get to play with the new cards at the same time.

Bring on [thing=192951]Empires[/thing] :)

[Update]: Ran some more tests with a slightly modified AI sheet (most significant change being that I dropped both tracks to 15 from 20), and a new set of kingdom cards. This set had a bit of everything that the AI has special triggers for: 2 VP cards, 2 Attacks, 2 Treasurers, which makes for a good test run. Played three games, and lost all three quite convincingly, even with some slight modifications in between. The kingdom card selections do have quite a significant impact on how the AI acts, so I&#039;m not surprised that it did better, but I didn&#039;t expect it to do so well. Mind you, I&#039;m not the best Dominion player out there, and I have no doubt that I could have played much better. It would not be too hard to make different version of the AI to suit different play styles / kingdom sets (in fact it would probably be necessary), which can be done by modifying the set of actions that it takes, and the composition of the prestige and economy tracks.

The two events for this kingdom were quite interesting, but didn&#039;t get a lot of use in this kingdom for the test runs done, not because they wouldn&#039;t be useful, but just didn&#039;t fit into the play style that I was trying.

[imageid=2874742 medium]

[imageid=2874743 medium]


[Update 2]: More testing with some more kingdoms on the first AI (now named Interactive AI), and although I&#039;m having difficulty beating it, I am pleased with how it is working. It has it&#039;s issues for sure, and unsurprisingly how successful it is does depend on the kingdom layout, but it is quite a bit of fun to be able to try out different card combinations from the same supply pile to see how well they do. 

[imageid=2878327 medium]

I have been quite enjoying this kingdom set, and have tried quite a few different approaches, though Scouting party (event) has seen use every single game - it&#039;s just been really handy, and helps cycle through your deck that much faster.

I have also started working of another AI using the same design style, one that will hopefully drain the kingdom piles faster while still providing a challenge (Merchant bot), as the interactive bot always will  gun towards Provinces, and the game always ends with that pile being empty.

[COLOR=#CC0066]Full details for those interested can be found on the  [thread=1519656]discussion thread for this project[/thread].[/COLOR]

Many thanks for those that showed some interest too, as it has inspired me to work even more on this project :)</body>

Always a pleasure to get this out so when [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/200307/item/4392658#item4392658]Maloma&#039;s February Thematic Challenge[/url] popped up in the 2016 SGoYT Challenges Geeklist I just had to enter.

This was my first run and I used the official Solo variant - I&#039;m planning on doing a run with the BadKittenRazor rules too as detailed in the challenge as they sound great.

Using the scoring system supplied for the challenge:
[u]Loss[/u]
Spaces = -45
Boats = +10
Starting cards = -12
Contract Cards = +14
Resources = +6
Locals = -4

[b]TOTAL = -31[/b]  :blush:

Yes, that&#039;s a minus 31.  Not so good, but only 108 off the lead...

Still there&#039;s only one winner in each solo game:

	<body>[size=18]GAME GIVEAWAY[/size]

Ok, two weeks off these lists is even more crazy then trying to feed a little newborn and keep it happy and healthy. :) So I just skipped past the January list and jump right into February, hoping to get the odd hour of solo gaming in during the remaining 3 weeks of parental leave.

To start off, here is a [b]game giveaway. Free shipping worldwide[/b]. To enter just comment this item with an (irrational) fear/irk you had or have - be it baby related or not. Though baby related ones score higher as this newfound dad needs to read that he is not alone with his &quot;fears&quot; and thoughs. 

I&#039;ll draw a winner at the end of the month. 

My (irrational?) behaviour which I would have never expected (as I consider myself a rather rational person) is around the water we use for the baby food. As our daughter was not really accepting breast feeding we needed to switch to baby food after the first week. Now, German fountain water is strictly regulated and our local water provider marks it as passing all strict criteria for preparation of baby food. Thats what we started using and our daughter was happily drinking her bottles. Then her dad started reading all those different web blogs around healthly water and his sleepy brain made the craziest assumptions and was painting the craziest pictures. Long story short, I ended up buying bottled mineral water that is also approved for baby food (and actually tastes really well to adult tongues, too :) ) as it showed even better rates than our local fountain water.  The little one is continuing to drink happily and her dad&#039;s mind is at ease (for now).</body>

	<body>In honour of our host this month I had to play this first using his solo variant.

Ben the Brigand set off to make his fortune.

Unfortunately he should have been called Ben the Bad Dice Roller.

Failed a simple mission early on and a rumour shortly after due to poor dice rolling and he never really got going.

With about 5 event cards left in the deck and only 2 Glory to his name he attempted an influence roll on an NPC pirate to complete another mission.

He failed it and a fight ensued.

[imageid=2872520 medium]He didn&#039;t win it. :shake:

A gorgeous looking game that tells great pirate stories. Although they tend to be stories of ineptitude and sinking when I play. :D

Made my top 20 last year and I can&#039;t see why it won&#039;t again this year.

Especially if I start using all the expansion components.

:thumbsup: Every game tells a different story and I get to be a pirate in them.

:thumbsdown: Set up isn&#039;t excessively long but it can feel it in comparison to the length of some games (well for me and my inept dice rolling anyway).</body>

	<body>Then it was on to a brand new game for me.

I&#039;d rewatched Ricky Royals playthrough to help get me started. But the rulebook is super quick to read anyway.

My first attempt using Train #1 was a bit all over the place. I definitely felt like a newbie.

[imageid=2872527 medium]
Managed to score 117 and I was pleased to hit over 100 on my first go.

I enjoyed it enough to try again with Train #2.

[imageid=2872529 medium]
Scored 147 this time. Felt like I did everything a bit better and even moved my surveyor this time.

However, I&#039;m now in a bit of a dilemma.  I had a lot of unplayed games at the turn of the year and I&#039;ve bought a few (including this) more since.

I was sure some would disappoint me and so I wouldn&#039;t have a worry about storage space.  However, I keep liking them all and today I found I quite liked this one too.

So what am I going to do about storage until [geeklist=199014]Dunshire[/geeklist] is finished?

Anyway, it starts off as a nice slow train ride but becomes a frantic locomotive out of control by the end.  You scramble for points as the game marches up the mountain.  If you&#039;ve done things well early on you might grab a bunch but if not then..... This also means it doesn&#039;t take too long to play either which is another plus.

Further plays will be needed to see if I can get over the high score aspect of it but I&#039;m looking forward to playing it and finding out.

:thumbsup: The most fun train game I&#039;ve played. It&#039;s a real race against time to score points and that aspect and tension appeals a lot.

:thumbsdown: Thematically dull to me and nothing new mechanically but the ratcheting up towards the game end condition more than makes up for it.

[b]Update 5 Feb:[/b]

Played again last night and used Train #3.

Managed to score 186.  I managed to control the resource bag very well early on and that seems key to success in this game.  I also managed to get every scoring marker out for the first time which helped too.

	<body>Finally today I got in a quick game of this (+ Batman) before picking up the girls from school.

After thinking this was too easy I scored a -2 at the weekend.

I had to try again.

Did better today. Managed my hero cards well and scored 11. That makes them Action Heroes.

[imageid=2872542 medium]The Final Battle.

It&#039;s quick, light and has just a smidge of thinky-ness.

Still not sure if it&#039;s a keeper but I do want to see what the other sets bring to the party (Green Lantern especially).

:thumbsup: A nice dice rolling filler with a great theme.

	<body>June 6th, 1944. The Allies are landing in Normandy to liberate German-occupied France. But the beaches are heavily defended and the whole operation is in jeapardy. Can you make the difference?

No. I couldn&#039;t. Not this time.

I decided to break this one out again, got it last year and only played it a couple of times. Not nearly enough.

I really like this game. But it&#039;s mainly rolling dice, I have to be in the right mood for something like that.

You can get stars (to recruit specialists), soldier (to expand your Unit), courage (to advance) and tools (to obtain Item Points). And of course skulls, to cancel another die. Which I tend to roll quite often in this game.

The rules are pretty easy and there&#039;s a map to teach you the basics of the game. In the practice run you ignore basically anything and just stick to moving your soldiers, then machine gun fire and landmines are added, throwing in specialists to offset the added difficulty. Then live ammo is added in the last stage of the introductory map. Now you use every rule. Which is a great way to get to know the game.

After going through the tutorial map once, just to make sure I remember everything, I decided to play my &quot;real&quot; game on Battle Map 03: Utah Beach!

[imageid=2872747large]

I didn&#039;t make it to the end of the map. I rolled really badly. I managed to get the Sharpshooter, which helped quite a bit but I probably was trying to buy too much stuff and didn&#039;t have enough soldiers left, when I needed them.

I will have to play this some more. It hardly takes up any space at all on the table (though I put [thing=149776][/thing] away for the time being, to make space for it) and plays quickly. The design works really well, buying specialists, getting awards, buying enough soldiers to not get yourself killed... I like the game.


:thumbsup: Works really well, good components and great tutorial to get you used to the rules.
:thumbsdown: Its rolling dice. So its quite luck dependent and not the most stratgic game out there.
:thumbsdown: I think its hard to get. Or maybe thats only the expansions. But the prizes I found are really high.

	<body>Well, the weirdest thing just happened to me.

I&#039;m not feeling too great today, but I wanted to get a game in.  So, I set up my newest hotness and sat down to play a exciting game of Runebound.  I thought Corbin, the rhino-horned dwarf, looked fun and went with him.

On the second turn of the game, I encountered an Orc Brigand.  I flipped the combat tokens. One of them missed the dice tray and hit my leg.  I carefully scooted my chair back to pick it up off the ground, but I couldn&#039;t find it.  

I still can&#039;t find it.  

I have scoured the room.  I&#039;ve looked on the floor, under the table, under the other table, on my pants, in my pockets, in my shoes...I have no idea where this combat token went.  So, I put the game away.  Hoping that it would show up.  It didn&#039;t!  

I guess it&#039;s not my day to play games.  I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find it sooner or later, I just have no idea where this thing went.  

[b]Edit:[/b] After a break, I went digging around the room again, and I found it! Phew. I know I could have made a replacement and then buy the new tokens when they came out, but I&#039;m really glad I found it. It was under the back leg of a different table in the room. I could see it, I only found it when I started feeling around. Haha. Game tokens fly all over the place. :)

Since I had already put the game away, I decided to work on my random encounter tokens. I thought it would be a fun variant to have random encounters. So I used some familiar looking tokens Of which I had extras.  

[center][ImageID=2873002 medium][/center]
[hr]
[b]Edit #2 - 2.3.16:[/b] I set the game up for another go, and wouldn&#039;t you know it, I dropped a combat token on the ground right away.  Luckily, I found it without any problems.  I really enjoy the combat tokens in this game.  However, they do fly all over the place.

I played with Corbin against the Corpse King.  He wiped the floor with me.  he gets an extra life point for every zombie that is spawned on the board.  He had 23 life points to my measly 10.  He defeated me in the second round of combat.  This was definitely a harder scenario than the other one, but still plenty fun.  I think I might need to run a second hero and have him or her simply be a zombie killer.  Maybe not, the challenge is kind of fun.

[center][ImageID=2874220 medium][/center]

I also played with my random encounter tokens.  Here&#039;s how I did it:

+ On the board there are nine of each encounters: Combat, Exploration, and Social.
+ I made 11 of each token.
+ I placed out 27 of them randomly on the board, and kept the remaining six in a stack to the side.
+ When I got to the parts of the time track that have me replenish the encounter tokens, I replaced the spent ones with the face-down tokens in my stack.
+ Then I shuffled the ones I just removed from the board with the rest of the remaining tokens and make a new stack.

I liked it quite a bit.  It made the game harder.  There were times when I needed money, and I wanted to fight a monster.  However, I was unsure which encounters contained a monster.  So, there is a little bit of push-your-luck. You might not have the time to waste on exploring the wrong encounters.

I am enjoying this game so much!  It&#039;s a blast!</body>

	<body>My attempts to keep the gaming spending down were thwarted with my purchase of this. Plus, some Amazon vouchers which I received over Christmas were spent on the the [thing=144811][/thing] expansion and a copy of [thing=171662][/thing].

So, my first proper play of this using the base game along with the printed copies of the Captains and Corp cards. A first play, which I didn&#039;t post, did not count as I was forgetting to launch boats for the AI. 

The purchase of Lobster and Cod licenses gave me plenty of scope for a lot of launches.

Final scores : Captain TC 61, Captain Kirkham 56, Me 73

	<body>This is my first of five plays with each of the Nations on their B-sides to take advantage of the special abilities.  I am going to complete this cycle prior to integrating the expansion to compare with the ten plays using the generic A-side that I summarized here: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/202271/item/4408141#item4408141]SGOYT January 2016[/url].  Since I did not mention this before, all plays are at Prince level.  

I plan to do the B-side plays in alphabetical order.  China comes first and it also happens to be the weakest B-side in multiplayer.  However, unlike multiplayer, the special production ability trigger on China is always successful per Nations solo rules, and the major ability of starting with an extra worker is also a huge boon in the solo game.

Having a building removed for 1 food per turn may seem to produce diminishing returns, but since I am a firm believer in covering military for resource build in the solo game it just meant that I could focus my energy on developing fewer buildings higher and balance those builds with Wonder development.  As the game progressed it seemed like everything was providing book, book, and more book.  I scored 26 book on the final turn alone and the 1/10 scoring of my combined resources made all the difference as this game exceeded my previous 10 generic side attempts.

Following is the final layout with the coins and book pile on the far right representing the ridiculous book score I was able to amass.

[imageid=2872885]

I need to complete plays of all five cultures to really determine if correct but this initial play does support the theory that B sides are stronger.

Nation: China (B-Side: Pagoda, +1 worker, +1 food)
Level: Prince

Game VP: 22
Colonies: 0
Wonders: 2
Buildings: 17

19 Gold
6 Wheat
12 Stone
86 Book
123 Resource Total: 12

Final Score: 53 - Saladin

I am going to do separate entry on the SGOYT list for each play unless that violates a standard of this community because I think each B-side will afford a unique perspective on its interaction with the Nations AI.  Onward to [b]Egypt[/b]!

	<body>I&#039;m trying to play this game. 

This game is driving me up the wall. 

First, of course, and this is somewhat minor, there&#039;s an artistic disconnect in the game. 

Card art: beautiful. 

[imageid=2872952 large]

These, on the other hand, are the tiles that form the board. 

[imageid=2872956 large]

Life is somewhat interesting when you have to match the green cards and tiles of one green to the green cards and tiles of the [i]other[/i] green, without any iconography, just based on colors, because of course such an important part of the game that threads through the campaign and muster phases doesn&#039;t deserve that much attention to detail. 

Also, you tell me which meeple is male and which meeple is female. Apparently the one with the hat is female, but I don&#039;t even understand why. Not to say that women can&#039;t wear hats, it just feels weird to me. It feels arbitrary. 

And yes, male and female is how they decided to distinguish the two meeples. Why? It matters for a few cards, but why should it? Why should a guy be able to use a harp in a town while the gal can&#039;t? This isn&#039;t so much demanding equality from a game as much as a thematic explanation. And, for that matter, a game play explanation. 

Why couldn&#039;t the meeples be, say, a magic user and a warrior? And then the magic user can use the harp and the warrior can&#039;t, and that would make more sense from multiple perspectives. 

So these (non)-thematic elements irk me, and the design elements make it difficult for me to play the game at times, because I&#039;m like &quot;oh, so THIS green surrounded by brown is actually the same as THIS green surrounded by yellow, but they just look different because of the color context around them, but they are the same, so....&quot; 

So okay, thematically it doesn&#039;t work for me as well as it could—everything else seems thematically there, so—so, okay, the graphic design doesn&#039;t work for me either, and I really depend on usability when it comes to interfaces of any kind. So what about gameplay? 

Remember when I said that Dice Hate Me Games had bad rulesets when it came to solo play? 

Yeah. Mayfair is apparently even worse when it comes to solo rulesets being explained with multiplayer rules. Plus the multiplayer rules go on for three pages about how battle is conducted. [b]Three pages.[/b] 

And it&#039;s weirder than that, because your base strength for attack and defense are determined by randomly drawing cards from the top of the &quot;creature&quot; deck (which has both creatures and items, but whatever). Sure, you add on top of that, but it just makes you feel like you don&#039;t have control over what&#039;s going on. 

Sometimes an empty marsh will turn up a four-power defense, and sometimes a marsh with an opposing cube in it will turn up a 1-power defense. In spite of some extra rules to try to ensure more cards will be turned up, this feels like it&#039;s at a minimal impact. 

The game is also slow. You start with god cards in your deck, which sounds awesome, but they all have power 1, which is both your attack currency and your mustering currency. You gradually add in cards from drafting from the Tisch, and you appease gods and thus remove them from your deck. This is a very interesting mechanism, actually, but the deck building feels like it moves slower than in other deckbuilders. I&#039;m not even sure why. 

There&#039;s a somewhat convoluted way of having the opponent draft cards in a controlled fashion, but... it begs the question: was it too expensive to include a die? Probably. It&#039;s not like Catan brought in any money to spend on graphic design and materials. /sarcasm 

Did you know that you need to cut the player aids out of the rulebook? Yeah. I&#039;m having visions of [thing=3562][/thing] all over again, which was actually a good game with a horrible ruleset and terrible art and graphic design. 

This game was painful to learn and painful to play for the first time and painful in some parts to look at. 

I am so sorry, I&#039;m ranting. I&#039;m trying to give as much information as possible as to why I&#039;m ranting, but it&#039;s very hard for me not to be so disappointed. I always expect better from Mayfair, and I don&#039;t know why I continue to do so. 

Morgan is a friend of mine, by the by. And I am really, really sorry that I didn&#039;t have better words to say. Part of me is really, really sorry that I&#039;m not keeping quiet. But ... argh. I&#039;m a reviewer. Such is life. 

There&#039;s every chance this game will shine, though, just like Theophrastus did. I have every confidence that this is a good game. It just is super-painful for me to deal with. And I had to deal with figuring out the rules to the SoloPlay version of TransAmerica, and I still hate learning this game more than I did trying to figure out what all the little colored rectangles meant in the TransAmerica SoloPlay ruleset.

Anyways. 

[b]Update:[/b] 

Ok, you folks were right, this is a [i]very[/i] interesting and pretty good game! Morgan&#039;s honor is preserved. ;) If not the honor of the graphic design team. Once I got the rules figured out it was pretty smooth sailing, except I still don&#039;t like trying to figure out which green shade is which. &gt;_&lt; 

I quite like this game. Making it more difficult is a good idea, and I do agree that randomly removing 10-15 cards from the first creature deck to get into harder encounters later is an excellent idea. 

Two thumbs up for game design. Wish the rules and the graphic design were better. </body>

	<body>Got my first ever play of Dead of Winter in this month.

I played the &quot;We need more samples&quot; mission 3 handed solo (6 characters) using the Cooperative variant from the rule book and the Crossroads app. As was suggested by someone on these forums, I just planned out my turn with each team and then checked the app to see if the crossroads card would activate. It worked perfectly fine.

The starting survivors for colony alpha:

Team 1: Leader - Student, Follower - Sheriff,
Team 2: Leader - Teacher, Follower - Doctor
Team 3: Leader - Chemist, Follower - Principal

I saw early that I had a nice combo of putting the teacher, the principal, and the student all at the school. This would let me kill 1 zombie with any die without rolling exposure with both the teacher and the student, while the principal and the student could look at and keep an extra card while searching. Because of this I wanted the student to move last in the first round so I organized the leaders in such a way as to make this possible. The first crisis had me gathering tools and as per the main objective I was always trying to kill zombies and collect samples. The tools were no problem with starting cards so I put my school plan into play and also sent the sheriff to the police station to use his ability to kill 2 zombies at a time. 

The round 2 crisis was tools again and had me scrambling a bit to find them, on top of that I pretty quickly ended up with more followers thanks to a crossroads card and a search event, which granted me the construction worker joining team 3. I was able to pass the crisis again and feed the team for a second round while continuing to keep the zombies under control when I suddenly ended up with the chance to get the key to the weapons locker of the police station. The consequences of this choice had a profound impact on the fate of our survivors and will necessitate me putting the rest of game in the spoiler section.

[o]I chose to take the key from the sheriffs which granted me a sniper rifle and a shotgun. The consequences were that I had to have the police station, hospital, and gas station empty of zombies in order to win the game now, along with collecting the 12 necessary samples. The sheriffs were willing to give us the guns, but only if we could keep the gas, medicine, and jail open for business which was a fair enough request I guess (I mean who cares about the library or school when zombies are trying to eat your brains.) The weapons were extremely useful in keeping the zombies under control and gaining samples, but the new mission objective forced me to change things up a bit because I had been so committed to the school. 

The construction worker wielding a shotgun got a good handle on the situation at the hospital and the sheriff was already at the police station keeping the zombie threat there relatively under control as well. The round 3 crisis had us looking for fuel which meant going to the gas station anyway. The principal and the student were going to head to the gas station to find gas and kill some zombies which would leave the school with just a teacher and 4 zombies. However, before he could leave the student had a mysterious encounter with a ninja. He chose to help the ninja out and together they cleared the school of zombies and the ninja joined team 1, but they both took a wound in the fight.  The doctor had to give up her busy work researching the samples we had already collected to help out the sheriff at the police station. She was promptly bitten by a zombie (why on earth do we have doctors fighting zombies, STAY IN THE LAB). Fortunately, she did not spread the disease to the sheriff. 

My brave group barely managed to scrape together the necessary gasoline but did manage to get it done while keeping everyone fed, however the trash pile was too high which cost another hit on the morale track. The team was 1 sample short and had the zombies well controlled going into the 4th round and things were looking good. 

The final crisis was a food crisis and was going to be a bit difficult because I had a small rabble of useless followers and real followers to feed as well. The teacher at the library made a heck of a lot of noise but came up empty on the food front. The principal and the student found what we needed at the grocery store while the sheriff cleared out the police station and made it safely back to the colony. The construction worker and her shotgun cleared out the hospital while the principal and the chemist&#039;s sniper rifle finished off the last of the zombies at the gas station. 

In the end everyone ate and the final crisis was averted with 0 zombies at the police station, hospital, and gas station and 15 samples collected. [/o]

A victory for our brave band, unfortunately with the untimely demise of the doctor the samples may be useless, perhaps there will be more adventures for the brave folks of colony alpha later.



:thumbsup: creates a wonderful story and is a very immersive experience
:thumbsdown: seemed easy, even playing in hardcore mode (which is recommended for coop by the rule book)
:thumbsdown: does seem to lose a bit of tension without the possible traitor or the secret missions (could definitely use the secret mission cards obviously without the traitor ones but it was not recommended by the rule book)

Overall a really cool game that I&#039;m glad to have in my collection. Probably more of a multiplayer game for me than solitaire because I think the possible traitor and secret missions would really add to the experience and I like my solo games just a bit more difficult and thinky than this one. However, I will certainly still play this solo and I think it works fine as a solo game.</body>

	<body>This one is a massive table hog for a solo game, a bit fiddly and the components could be better. However it doesn&#039;t get nearly enough love, a really fun scifi game, and I also picked it up really cheap so it&#039;s been a bit of a bargain.

From what I can tell this does X-Com better than the licensed game.</body>

It&#039;s funny, I bought this game mainly for solo play, and yet the 1st three plays were all FTF or Vassal/Skype, ie, multiplayer.  Have no doubt, multiplayer IS the preferred way to play this game.

In any event, today was the day I decided to try it solo with the &#039;bots. I am a huge fan of the bots in the COIN games, and now [thing=11825][/thing] is in my sights because there are bots for the 2nd edition.

For better or worse, &#039;bots are not always the smartest tools in the shed.  They robotically meander ahead, but not really following a set strategy.  The Allied bots don&#039;t really make any special effort for (or against) the Bomb, they don&#039;t make any special efforts for anything.  The bots mainly seem to be exercises in min-maxxing.

Which is OK, my main goal is to kill some time and get some Vassal time in with this particular module (yes, I use Vassal for a lot of solo play, saves time setting up/taking down, which means more play time).

The Churchill bot won the 1st conference I played, but other than that, the Allies didn&#039;t do too much.  Nobody advanced ANY of the war front.  As Stalin I won the Bomb issue, and while the Allies advanced Bomb research, I get VP just the same.

Saved game after 1 conference (another advantage of Vassal play), I&#039;ll get back to the game later this week.</body>

	<body>[u][b]Session 1:[/b][/u]
vs. Arkayne

[b]VICTORY![/b] (2 terror cards left)

Rescued hostages: 5
Dead hostages: 2

After seeing a surge of SGoYT postings about Hostage Negotiator, I decided to break my copy out again.  I started with Arkayne because I’d be relearning the rules 6 months my last session.

I got the threat level down to zero pretty quickly then was able to reduce it a few times to rescue some hostages that way.  Unfortunately, terror events caused the deaths of two hostages, but I was still feeling pretty confident.  Then I drew the terror card which halves the terror deck.  I chose to do this, but it cut the deck down to just three red cards and the pivotal event.

Time now became tight.  With two hostages left, I was just able to purchase minor extraction for the next round.  I rolled a success and expended two cards to turn that face into a success as well, thus rescuing the two remaining hostages.

But Arkayne was still uncaptured.  I got lucky when the next terror card was a hostage escape attempt.  With the threat level at zero, I only needed one success to capture Arkayne — I rolled three, so I guess I really really captured him.  We mourned the two dead hostages, but the five we rescued were grateful.


[u][b]Session 2:[/b][/u]
vs. Donna

[b]Defeat[/b] (time)

After my victory vs. Arkayne, I set up a second session against Donna, the nutty professor.  This one did not go nearly as well.  I had bad luck from the start as the dice went cold, but I didn’t help my cause by being too spendthrift with my initial cards.  I should have held some back, but I spent them all, and I never quite recovered as the dice stayed cold.

I eventually rescued six hostages, but four were killed in the process; even then, I rescued the final three during the Pivotal Event, so the game ended on time.  An additional hostage was taken thanks to a terror card, making the total 13.

I had threat level down to zero when the Pivotal Event arrived.  I managed to accumulate 4 conversation points during the round, and then I spent them all to concede the major demand. This caused -3 threat which forced the rescue of another three hostages, thus doubling my rescued total to six.  But that was all I could do and the game ended with no cards remaining in the terror deck.

It had been so long since I&#039;d last played in part because my first sessions had left me feeling somewhat &quot;meh&quot; about this game.  But somehow the design clicked for me this time around, and I enjoyed it much more.  I&#039;m looking forward to more sessions soon.

:thumbsup: Plays quickly, but has some strategic meat on its bones; hits a sweet spot for playtime on a weekday evening with limited time

:thumbsup: Variable terror card deck and different abductors enhance replayability; each game plays out differently

:thumbsdown: I am surprised to find that the theme is a little too dark for my taste, but I&#039;m coming to terms with it</body>

	<body>Robinson continues to die.

It was really nice sitting outside at my daughter&#039;s soccer practice with a tray on my lap, playing Friday, so I guess I can&#039;t complain too much.

I played twice and scored -47 and -45 on Level 2.  I died both times in the Yellow Phase, basically the same amount through the deck.  Obviously I need a new strategy, but I&#039;ll figure it out.  The second time I actually suffered immensely from the card order, pulling a bunch of high fighting cards early and then ending my play with two aging cards and a bunch of zeroes.  Oh well, like I said, it was a nice night.

Update: Another soccer practice, more Robinson dying.  The first of my two games went better, reaching into the red phase but falling short (-42). The second play I felt like stupid Robinson, reaching the yellow phase where I realized I had basically only pulled 0 value fighting cards the first time through the deck. Seriously, Robinson couldn&#039;t have fought off an angry house cat.  A terrible -56.  The weather outside was still nice, though.</body>

	<body>Have this set up on my table. Have read the rules, set up my bomber and crew and taken off successfully. Will be playing this piecemeal over the next few days. Updates to come.

==============================

So my crew flew their first mission (of a 35 mission tour of duty).

[imageid=2874744 large]

[imageid=2874745 large]

The 11 brave men, led by Captain Arte Novak took off from the Marianas Islands in their bomber, &quot;Flak Happy&quot;, on their way to bomb an airfield in Okinawa.

[imageid=2874747 large]

In spite of drifting off course, the Flak Happy managed to meet the rest of the squadron and get into formation for the flight to the target. Flying over the open ocean, in great weather, the squadron made good time.

Passing over Iwo Jima, the crew encountered their first enemy fighter, a Shoki, that approached from 12 o&#039;clock but failed to hit the bomber.

[imageid=2874750 large]

The Flak Happy was almost to their target zone.

[imageid=2874751 large]

A Japanese fighter, a Shidon, approached from 3 o&#039;clock, evading the bomber&#039;s gunners and spraying the B-29 with shells.

[imageid=2874752 large]

The shells tore through some ammo for the Aft Upper Guns, destroyed the Aft Lower Guns and the Backup Generator but most disastrously the Left Gunner, Sergeant Ernest Malone, was killed. The damage resulted in the depressurization of the waist section of the plane.

With temperatures in the depressurized compartment dropping rapidly, the pilot opted to stay at high altitude, in formation, for one final turn as they approached the target. A Hayabusa flew in from 6 o&#039;clock and riddled the rear of the bomber with shells. 

[imageid=2874753 large]

The Central Fire Control Gunner&#039;s sights were destroyed, along with an ammo box in the utility section (luckily the resulting explosion did negligible damage). The tail gunner, Sergeant John Bennett received some light wounds.

The Flak Happy released its payload, but unfortunately did not hit the target.

Turning back towards home base, the Flak Happy encountered a Hayate fighter but took no damage. The pilot chose to break formation to reduce altitude in order to prevent the remaining crew in the depressurized Waist section from getting frostbite.

After uneventful travel over the ocean, the crew flew over Iwo Jima again. They watched in horror, defenseless as a Zero approached from 3 o&#039;clock. With the left gunner dead and the CFC&#039;s gun sights destroyed they had no defensive fire to cover that position.

[imageid=2874755 large]

[imageid=2874756 large]

Luckily the fighter failed to score a hit and disappeared into the distance.

The crew remained at low altitude, out of formation, until they finally sighted the Marianas Islands. After a safe landing the crew breathed a sigh of relief, but with heavy hearts at the loss of Sergeant Ernest Malone.

	<body>First win! A nail biter of a game that I won a the last moment using the &quot;Sniper Take The Shot&quot; card. Had enough hostages saved and just needed to eliminate Arkayne. Terror deck was almost out of cards, threat level got maxed that turn too. Whew!

I&#039;m learning to take calculated risks better AND use the card to gain single conversation points, a detail I was forgetting to utilize.

	<body>It&#039;s the latest in the COIN series which I got yesterday. And, it&#039;s another one with frenemies, French/Patriot vs British/Indians. Usually in Revolutionary War games, it is the Americans versus the British that are the main show with the Franco-British rivalry as a sideshow. In this one, it is really the British and French involved in a proxy war in the Americas. While the British want to bleed the Americans and French into submission, the most focused enemies of the Patriots are not the British, but the Indians. The Indians want to help the British hold on to the Colonies, but they want to become a strong unified nation next to a weak colonial presence. 

I decided to start a solitaire game as the Patriot player. 

The first campaign was pretty short before the onset of winter. The French moved naval squadrons to the West Indies in order to build up their forces to intervene and had their agents provocateur recruiting militia in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, the British mustered troops in Norfolk, and then occupied all the cities on the east coast driving the militia guarding Philadelphia into New Jersey. The Patriots responded by strengthening their positions in Virginia and New Hampshire and building up Washington&#039;s Army in Massachusetts. Later, with French help, they were able to wrest control of Quebec and New York from the British. However, their control is paper thin. Meanwhile, the Indians built their first village and managed to advance their resources to beyond zilch despite being stiffed by the British on both their requests for aid.

I can really feel the storm is coming....

[b]Update 1[/b]

Well, now that I have gotten that XCOM2 Sectoid off my back, I finally can get back to writing about Liberty or Death. When we last left the guys in blue they were facing their first winter quarters phase. 

The 1st Winter was a political one. The patriot&#039;s committees of correspondence moved New York, New Hampshire, and Virginia to active opposition. Likewise, the British secured their base by moving the cities of Quebec, Norfolk, Boston, and Charleston to active support. Gage was replaced by Howe. Not exactly sure what the Indians and French did other than to accumulate money. Then, a few people deserted including the militia of New Jersey. That put the Patriots up politically over the British 14-10, but left the British with a considerable advantage in resources.

During the second campaign, the British pressed their resource advantage by moving troops into New York City and Philadelphia and organizing the Tories there. That put British in control of all the cities. Thomas King also organized the Tories in South Carolina and built Fort there. The British also gave a substantial amount of resources to the Indians, and they stirred up trouble on the Ohio frontier by raiding New York and building up war parties in the Northwest.

Meanwhile, the Patriots fortified their positions in New York and New Hampshire and recruited militias in Connecticut/Rhode Island and Virginia. My goals were to get some forts on the map for the next winter, expand the Patriot positions in New England and Virginia with the hopes that Virginia becomes a base that opens up the Southern Colonies.

Then, the storm hit. The French who had been quietly building up forces finally intervened by sending regulars into Massachusetts under Rochambeau and into the West Indies and blockaded Norfolk. The British responded by invading Connecticut/Rhode Island and New Jersey from New York City and Philadelphia while Howe left Boston with some regulars and troy militia bound for South Carolina. They also skirmished with French in the West Indies. 

That touched off a rash of Brilliant Stroke card plays which basically trumped the next two Patriot movement opportunities. The first up were the Indians who used theirs to max out the number of war parties and overrun Maryland/Delaware. Then, the French were up next, and they used theirs to build up forces in Massachusetts and invaded Boston and finished the mutual destruction of all the forces in the West Indies by skirmishing with the British. Then, the Indians abandoned Maryland/Delaware for Pennsylvania with majority of their war parties, but sent two active war parties into Virginia to cause some trouble. And, we were at the 2nd Winter Quarters. Somewhere in there, the British also drove away the squadron blockading Norfolk, but it succeeded in protecting Virgina from British intervention.

The second winter was tough on the Patriots. While the additional resources from building forts was a bonus, the British really clobbered us by consolidating support in the occupied areas. They&#039;re up 23-14. The only advantage that I have in the coming campaign is that the British spent all their resources rewarding loyalty among their subjects. I will have to get into a few of these British enclaves this campaign and rabble rouse while preventing the British from inflicting more casualties than they take, but I have to be careful not to let that get out of hand which would let the French win when the political winds shift. I also have to get this insurrection to spread to other colonies beyond New England. Also, sometime during this campaign the British will probably play their Brilliant Stokes card and trump at a critical time, so I definitely have a hill to climb.

	<body>Played my first game of this tonight and it was fun. It was just the base game with no expansions mixed in. I think I won and didn&#039;t break any rules as I found all eight doors. I will likely play a few more times with the base deck before starting to choose which expansions to mix in.

:thumbsup: very colorful which is nice to see on the table
:thumbsdown: I don&#039;t think I am the worlds best shuffler and his game has plenty of it. 
:thumbsup: twenty minutes to play is just about perfect for my lifestyle during the week.

Up next is Cruel Necessity on Friday as long as it is delievered tomorrow.</body>

	<body>Okay, so I gave in and bought the Force Awakens starter for X-wing, and I completely 100% blame this guy:

[user=garyrbrooks][/user]

:) To be fair, I did use a gift card to a store in order to get it. So I didn&#039;t really spend any money on it...

Anyway, I opened it up last night and got it all set up and ready to play at 9:30 PM.

[imageid=2873322]

I started playing through the tutorial using an android app I found for the AI of the tie fighters. The game started off well with my x-wing evading some shots, but I was also being evaded by the fast flying tie fighters.

[imageid=2873324]

Then things took a turn for the worse and one of the tie fighters got in a good shot on me, taking down most of my shields. I was able to retaliate with a a few hits, then things went really bad and I took a damage card.

[imageid=2873326]

I was starting to lose interest at this point, but he combat just kept going. I kept missing, they kept missing. We kept flying by each other.

[imageid=2873327]

Then it happened, my interest waned enough that I decided to pick up and try again later. Obviously there is something I was missing. I took my last picture at 10:41 PM, a little over an hour after I started. I was thinking it would be a quick game, even with me learning the rules. It was just a tutorial. An hour of measuring out all the ships and precisely moving them using the templates ended up feeling more like work than fun.  So, I am going to give it another shot, maybe tonight, but someone please let me know what I am missing or that things you add after the tutorial make a big difference. </body>

	<body>I received this today in the mail after buying directly from Fowers Games via their website.

I tried two runs at the Intro game (with two floors) and lost both times. I made the serious mistake of removing 9 cards from the guard decks because I was playing solo, but I should&#039;ve only removed 3 cards as I was playing 3-handed :laugh:. Man, that first floor guard sped up quickly.

The second play was much better as I got the flow down. I had found and cracked the safe on the first floor and found the safe on the second as well. The Juicer got kinda trapped though and when The Peterman tried to run upstairs and trigger a distracting alarm to fade the heat on her, he was himself caught with no stealth left.

I&#039;ll try this again tomorrow if I get a chance (looks like I&#039;m staying home from work to tend my ill daughter - just a cold). I&#039;d also like to play this with others as I think it will be fun that way too.

I must remember to take some pictures with my reports...</body>

	<body>Finally got to open and play this expansion. I am a sucker for Imperial Settlers and I don&#039;t really understand why.

The game went more slow than what I had anticipated because I had forgotten a good deal of the game and the new mechanics really changed the way you play the game. Instead of thinking what common cards to discard you are now thinking about what atlanteans cards to discard.

I won (obviously because the solo game is not challenging) with a score of 35 so there is a lot of room for improvement.

I will probably give it another go tonight.</body>

	<body>Little game with 2 avatars (Scout and Medic), first movie scenario. I started with larger decks to increase the difficulty (18+1 cards 10 specialists 8 grunts and the special avatar card instead of  12+1) as recruited cards would take longer to come back and would be &quot;diluted&quot;.
This way I hoped to have the same difficulty level than a 3 players game.
It made the game very challenging (too much for me). My poor guys took 2 strikes each before they could kill the first wave of enemey entering the combat zone, and the second wave killed them, during the second objective.</body>

	<body>I finally played my copy!  Oh man, it&#039;s been what...4 months since I got it?  Gotta be at least.  This was a two player game, to learn the rules.  Next time I play I&#039;ll go with the solo rules.  I needed to learn how to play so I can figure out how to teach it.  This is my first farming [i]euro[/i] game.  I highlight the euro part because technically my first farming game is...well...[thing=5195][/thing].

Thoughts?  I actually liked it.  I&#039;m glad I backed the Kickstarter.  After receiving it, setting it up and not playing, then reading the rules and other people&#039;s posts, I really started to feel like I&#039;d wasted the money on the KS campaign.  I&#039;m glad I decided to try it before deciding though.

Final scores were 193 and 234.  I totally didn&#039;t expect the winning player to actually win, because the opponent was getting 5 free rice each round as well as a free livestock and 1 water.  However, in the second draft, the winner managed to snag Spirit Card 32, which says that the paddies do not need water to grow.  That enabled him to plant and grow his entire field and harvest each paddy in round 7, thanks to card 35, which means he only needed one laborer to harvest each hex.

Great farming euro.  We&#039;ll see how it compares with [thing=146886][/thing].  I&#039;ll have that baby in my hands tomorrow.


Edit (02/03/16):

Well, I don&#039;t have La Granja in my hands.  Things didn&#039;t work out for getting it from my friend who made the order on CSI, so I took a stab at the solo rules for Spirits.

I finished with a score of 173.  That&#039;s considered Average, and for my first game solo, I&#039;m okay with that.  I noticed that when I was picking the Spirit cards for the draft, I was choosing based on what the ability was it gave me, rather than the number, which meant that my opponent generally got the first water more often, and there were some solo cards drawn that meant I got no water to my reservoir.  I&#039;ll have to put more focus on the numerical value of the cards next time.  Interesting dynamic, I must say.  </body>

	<body>And another game of this using the solo variant rules on The Builders: Middle Ages BGG page.

I was doing ok until I foolishly took a 5VP building to stop the AI getting it, and revealed an 8VP building underneath it.  Realised afterwards that I hadn&#039;t dealt out the full 4 buildings (I was using the top card of the deck as the 4th building to conserve table space), and I should have been allowed to &#039;look under&#039; that card first, as I would never have taken it otherwise.  But I did, and the AI on its next turn took the 8VP card, giving it 18VP and triggering game end.  It&#039;s final score: 21VP.  Mine: 13. :( ;)</body>

	<body>On the 2nd of February I played some small solo games:

Tiny Epic Galaxies against the normal rogue galaxy. First time that the Rogue was stealing away planets from under me - usually I&#039;m mostly worried about them leveling up too much. I tweaked out a win though. I&#039;m enjoying this game more and more.

After that, the shufflefest Onirim. I failed to get the last door but it was pretty close. Awesome value in this game (got the second edition for 2 euro at Essen last year).

Lastly, Friday. First game I accidently shuffled in a challenge card instead of an age card when I went through my deck. Started again when I found out. I managed a 46 point win, but it was pretty close. 

So, three great small games under my belt, good start of the month!</body>

	<body>I&#039;m back! Haven&#039;t had a ton of time for gaming recently. Work has been crazy, and have been busy with friends and other projects. Outside of a few snowstorm plays of [thing=141572][/thing] during Winter Storm Jonas and the 34&quot; of falling snow, you&#039;d think I would have spent more time gaming.

Nope. I got Final Fantasy Explorers for my 3DS. And given that Monster Hunter and Final Fantasy are two of my favorite video game series, well, that&#039;s the perfect &quot;You got chocolate in my peanut butter&quot; kind of situation for me. 

This last weekend, I took a few extra days and visited a good friend in VA to go to a concert for her birthday (MUSE!) and just hang out. She got me into playing Netrunner with her and her boyfriend, which is a game I had ALWAYS wanted to try. I loved it. Sadly, being a hidden-information game it doesn&#039;t seem like it would work for solo play at all, and I don&#039;t know many people here in Baltimore that would even be interested in it, let alone that actually play it. However, I still had that LCG bug going on, so when I got back to my house last night, I got out a game that I have an odd relationship with; The LOTR LCG. 

I like this game, I really do. I like how challenging it is to play solo. I personally play one-handed, because I find that playing with two decks is entirely too much work for me. That makes it even harder, too, but I don&#039;t mind losing. 

However, I feel like with the not-small amount of money I&#039;ve spent on this game, I still don&#039;t have the player cards to make the kinds of decks that I want to. And sometimes I find it frustrating because it is so challenging that I don&#039;t like the idea of spending more money on it. (For what it&#039;s worth, I only own the core set, [thing=107933][/thing], and [thing=146574][/thing]. 

So with what I have, I built an interesting little Spirit/Leadership deck, and got promptly trounced by some unlucky monster spawns playing the first quest from the core set.

I will probably tweak some things and try it again tonight when I get home. 

Those of you who play this: what else do I NEED to start making decks that might have a slightly higher winning percentage? Or am I just a little bit boneheaded and not looking at this the right way?

:thumbsup: Solo playable, living card game. Can spend some time deck building and not have to wait for your friends to come by to see how well you did. Really hard. Hobbitses.
:thumbsdown: Really hard. Expensive. Addictive and causes you to spend more money on it. </body>

	<body>Hey everyone. I&#039;m actually posting for the first time, since I&#039;m too lazy to record most of my plays. But today I tried to do something I planned for a long time, so I&#039;ll share with you all.

Since I love Onirim and I usually play only few expansions (the ones I liked on first play) I decided it&#039;s time to revise my opinions, so I played all the expansions once to see how my opinion changes or not.

1) [b]The Book of Steps Lost and Found[/b]
    This expansion really makes you think ahead. Especially in the begining, when you don&#039;t want to burn through deck too fast. It&#039;s one of my favourites when I want a good challenge. You get more luck, but also more manipulation thanks to the spells.
    The play wasn&#039;t so smooth. Wrong cards the first few turns coupled with nightmares that were clearly out to get me. They actually formed groups to beat me down. But there was still hope... For a while. If you think about it, they kind of tried to corner me. Well, they sadly succeeded. I ended with only 6 doors when the deck ran out. Can&#039;t win them all.

2) [b]The Glyphs[/b]
    You need to open 12 door cards in this expansion. At first I thought: &quot;Really? You actually want me to open more stuff now? I have only one labyrinth!&quot; But as time goes by, it&#039;s not as impossible as it seems at first. You need to plan to open some doors with keys though and actually I tend to save keys more in this one to do just that. And of course the incantation, which is a fine touch. This is one of those that get better when you mix multiple expansions.
    The game was actually really smooth and I managed to win. Not decisively though, I almost lost with only 6 cards left in the deck.

3) [b]The Dreamcatchers[/b]
    One of my favourite. It reduces shuffling for one and second it brings another manipulation possibility. You can effectively put nightmares out of the game without having to deal with them. Great expansion.
    Since I&#039;ve been playing with this one a lot, winning was a bit easier than I would expect. I guess if you play multiple times, you develop specific strategies for expansions. But this was a lot of fun to do and a lot of tight decissions. At one time I had to put 3 nightmares back in the deck so I wouldn&#039;t lose. That was stressful :)

4) [b]The Towers[/b]
    In my opinion one of the expansions that actually make the game a lot easier, since you can manipulate the deck a lot. There is tactics involved for sure, if you waste your towers for a row and get a bunch of nightmares, it&#039;ll eat you up. But if you balance manipulation with keys and making the tower row fast, you&#039;ll probably be fine.
    I said I find it easier and I actually won pretty decisively with 25 cards left in the deck. I used 5 towers to manipulate the deck and built the tower line in 4 turns while knowing no nightmare will sneak up on me. So a nice win there.

5) [b]Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions[/b]
    This one really haunts me. I know it&#039;s possible to win. I&#039;ve won once before. But it&#039;s hard. At least for me. The Dark Premonitions are mean and unforgiving and I curse them each time I play this. But it keeps me interested, cause I want to beat them with my Happy Dreams! But I have to be in a happy mood to play this because it makes me sad almost every time... Since almost every time I lose.
    It&#039;s pretty apparent from the intro I didn&#039;t win. Half way through the deck an no Happy Dream in sight. Dark Premonitions ate my door and locations in the meantime and I started losing hope. Then I got Happy Dreams and killed the remaining Darkness. Unfortunately, it was too late and my time (deck) ran out. Have to play more of this expansion.

6) [b]Crossroads and Dead Ends[/b]
    When I played this for the first time, it seemed very easy. But I was actually very lucky back then. Since whenever I had a lot of Dead End cards in hand, I never had something important to lose with discard. With repeated play, there&#039;s more to tactics while playing this then meets the eye. You have to time your Escape action very carefully, which is the key to success. And also refrain from wasting the wilds.
    This one was interesting. I was playing a few turns with 2 Dead Ends in hand figuring I&#039;ll either draw more and Escape, or nightmare will solve it. Nope. I kept drawing locations and wilds. I started to panic, triggered an Escape and my new hand was eaten by nightmare the next turn. Brilliant. I thought winning was impossible by then. But with some manipulation of deck cards with keys, I opened the last 2 doors by discarding matching key from hand when I put them to draw so I could do this. It was very tight though.

7) [b]The Door to the Oniverse[/b]
    You know in horror movies they&#039;re always told not to open the strange doors, because there&#039;s always something to eat them. Usually without killing them first. But you actually have to open the strange door here. Now I played this before only once, because I found this expansion to be the most confusing. All those animals with special abilities, come on. But the abilities are really cool and they give you so much control over what&#039;s happening it makes it a lot more tactical than just the base game. And you only use a combination of 8 of those, so each play is different. This is the one I really started to like only after today&#039;s play.
    The only two animals I didn&#039;t get were The Harpoon Hunter (which was not in the game at all) and Repentant Treasure Keeper because he was at the bottom of draw deck at the end of the game. So I got a bit familiar with the animals. Love the squirrels (also love them in Sylvion, great friends, I want them at home as pets) and The Mirror saved my hide twice (it was in the deck 2 times). If it wasn&#039;t for the Denizens, I would have lost. But they made the game so interesting by letting me manipulate draw deck, use discarded cards, repeat symbols, limbo nightmares without resolving them... There&#039;s so much packed in this one it&#039;s unbelievable. And the Denizens didn&#039;t seem unbalanced, like some had better uses or were clearly more powerful, none of that stuff. And it amazes me how they actually did this one, although it&#039;s really confusing to play for the first time. Still a very good game that was.

I stated I love Onirim, it&#039;s quick, have very good decisions, doesn&#039;t feel mechanical, has small footprint and all you use is a deck of cards. This is a brilliant design in my opinion and the expansions make it even etter in time.

One thing that bothers me though. Why are the nightmares clearly shaped and look like black cats? Cats are nice!

Hope you enjoyed this long story and that you enjoy Onirim as much as I do :)

Have an ice day... A nice day!</body>

Bit of a cheat as it&#039;s the app (inspired by Koinskyz) but I am enjoying it and I think I&#039;m learning a bit about baseball.

Won a World Series (after many learning games and losses) but this was my most convincing.  I had a good one with the Bostons which I won 7-6 I think.

It&#039;s a quick game and I&#039;m still learning and I miss cards and boards but the app makes it so easy to break out and play a game whilst you&#039;re making a cup of tea and then another one whilst you&#039;re drinking it!

:thumbsup:  Nice looking, playing and easy to use app
:thumbsdown: I was a bit disappointed the app meeples are chess pawns but I&#039;m very over that now

	<body>Been eyeing this one on the shelf lately, so it&#039;s time for another play.

My third attempt at mission #3 just using basic rules. In this mission, my squad has to locate four scientists marooned on Jovvian III. The monster in this showing would be the humanoid mutants.

Managed to win this time! 

I had originally intended to move down the centre of the map, but early use of my intelligence resources changed my plans and I aimed for the intelligence resource cache on the right hand side, finding one scientist in the cave complex.

Moving down, I used the single intelligence resource that I had found to locate another scientist. A nervy trip into cave complex &#039;c&#039; found the last two scientists for the completion of the mission.

A win, with loss of both my fire team and assault team.

	<body>One of my most played games, so it&#039;s surprising just how long it&#039;s been since I played (as ever, getting all the expansions in the base box of a game usually nixes my desire to keep playing it). 

Took Valeros and Ezren, who are both quite nicely buffed by now, through the Local Heroes scenario - a pretty simple affair whereby we bask in the former glories that have led us here. (Although packing the general store with monsters does give it the whiff of the January sales in this part of the world.) No real problems, and I seemed to roll well throughout - which is highly unusual - but this felt a little rote and overly-familiar, for the first time. I&#039;ll put it down to the fact it&#039;s a gentle, rather generous, stocking up mission. Need to get back out to the harder campaigns now. (I&#039;m also considering levelling up Amiri to bring more location cards out when I have a three man team.)

	<body>My first attempt at this game solo.

[b]Turn 1[/b]
Sergeant Lorenzo and Brother Leon both killed a genestealer.
There was a Psychic Assault on Brother Valencio but he was strong enough to withstand it.
2 new genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 2[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius killed a genestealer but Brother Scipo was unable to copy him.
The genestealers did not hit any marines.
4 new genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 3[/b]
Brother Deino and Sergeant Lorenzo both missed with their attacks. Luckily Brother Leon killed 2 genestealers.
Both blip piles were empty so they moved on to the next location killing 1 genestealer in the process.

[b]Turn 4[/b]
Arrived at the Black Holds and Brother Leon ignited the Promethium Tank.
Lexicanium Calisterius and Brother Scipio both missed their targets and so, in a zero tolerance environment, the rest of the marines threw Brother Scipio to the genestealers who promptly killed him.
3 more genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 5[/b]
Sergeant Lorenzo and Brother Deino both killed genestealers but Brother Leon and Brother Valencio missed. The marines were understanding towards Brother Leon who had so far proved his worth but Brother Valencio was left to fend for himself and the genestealers killed him.
2 more genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 6[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius failed to hit his target but thankfully his target also failed to hit him.
2 more genestealers appeared as they travelled to the next location.

[b]Turn 7[/b]
After arriving at the Wrath of Baal Chapel, and having a good motivational talk with each other, Brother Deino and Sergeant Lorenzo both killed a genestealer each, and Brother Leon killed 2 genestealers.
The genestealers did not dare hit any marines after that onslaught.
2 new genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 8[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius killed a genestealer and none of the marines were hit in retaliation.
2 new genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 9[/b]
Brother Deino killed a genestealer but both Brother Leon and Sergeant Lorenzo missed their targets.
Brother Leon paid the price for his mistake and was killed by the same genestealer that he was trying to kill. Brother Deino also perished and could be heard cursing Sergeant Lorenzo (who had just missed that very genestealer) as he died.
Sensing blood, 4 more genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 10[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius missed his target but 2 swarms also missed him.
1 genestealer tried to attack Sergeant Lorenzo but ended up dead.
2 more genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 11[/b]
Sergeant Lorenzo missed his attack but one of the blip piles was empty so the quickly travelled to the last location killing 3 genestealers in the process.

[b]Turn 12[/b]
After another team talk the remaining marines arrived at the Toxin Pumping Station. Lexicanium Calisterius killed 2 genestealers and Sergeant Lorenzo also killed 2 genestealers that tried to attack him.
4 new genestealers appeared.

[b]Turn 13[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius activated the control panel and removed 4 genestealers from one of the blip piles. Sergeant Lorenzo missed with his attack and thankfully so did all the genestealers.
1 more genestealer appeared.

[b]Turn 14[/b]
Lexicanium Calisterius killed 2 genestealers but died while defending himself from a third genestealer.
Sergeant Lorenzo also died after being overrun and flanked by genestealers.

There were 5 genestealers left in 1 blip pile and the other pile was empty. There were also 4 active genestealers.

:thumbsup: - Small playing space.
:thumbsdown: - Relies on a single die roll to see who lives and dies.</body>

	<body>This is a very rare fantasy adventure game in that it has no real combat, no slaying of monsters, no hulking swordsmen in armor. It has a slightly new age feel as a player enters a mystical order and then completes various tasks on a variable map to ward off the influence of evil across the land. It&#039;s essentially a pickup and deliver game set in an imaginative realm, and plays quite well solo.

The mechanisms, components and rulebook are clunky in all the expected ways for a thematic Avalon Hill game from 1982 (it&#039;s quite a long game too), but this one has a real charm to it. From the designers&#039; notes:

&#039;And what do we find when we enter this realm? We meet a world of Truth, Beauty, and Peace; where Evil is conquered by positive creative Good rather than by violent destruction; where there is intense competition in attaining personal excellence, but always for the good of all rather than for selfish gain; where there is reverence for the Mystery of the Powers Beyond, yet where that Mystery becomes a part of all; where Music, Dance, Ritual, and Craft have Power to affect the course of events.&#039;

	<body>Another game and this one was even better than the first one. I managed to score 104 points. The Atlanteans were swimming in resources. As a matter of fact, they were so fill with resources that I realized I must have done something wrong.

And indeed I did. I was multiplying the Actions everytime I was using them.

I will have to try again!</body>

	<body>Me and the wife have been watching War and Peace on BBC 1.

It had made me want to get this back to the table ASAP.

I finally managed it and played the 1809 campaign.

A massive victory in Ratisbon destroyed all the Austrian forces and I thought an easy victory would follow but then I seemed to get bogged down in the west of the map capturing the objectives.

Time was ticking by.

On the final turn of the game I managed to get a hard fought victory in Vienna without Napoleon present and then force marched Napoleon and nearly everyone else in to Wagram to claim victory on an envelope check.

[ImageID=2875119 medium]

It is an inferior victory (i.e. Napoleon did it quicker and is therefore better than me :D) but with a couple of turns left I didn&#039;t think I would manage it but received a ton of supply points which I saved for the forced march I would need to do on the final turn.

As you can see from the board the objectives I held in the west were looking vulnerable to enemy forces and I needed to risk that in order to have a chance of winning before time ran out.

:thumbsup: Gives the epic sweeping feel of a historic military campaign.

:thumbsdown: I&#039;ve played and won the first 7 campaigns with only 3 defeats (i.e. I&#039;ve played 10 times).  Difficulty may be a little on the easy side.  I don&#039;t care though as I have a blast and during the game you get tough decisions to make and squeaky bum moments.</body>

	<body>Headline: Noted Terrorist Escapes!

Dreaded Terrorist known by most simply as &quot;Arkayne&quot; escaped arrest after taking seven hostages when he was surrounded by police at a hotel in downtown Philadelphia last evening.  After a long standoff using a trained negotiator, all of the hostages were released, but Arkayne was no where to be found.  Interviews with the hostages revealed that he had an escape plan devised early on and used the cover of a supposed press conference to make his getaway.  He is considered armed and extremely dangerous.

Clarence Hendrix, a security guard at the hotel, was found wounded with the hostages, he is in the hospital in critical condition.  The rest were treated as a matter of course, but were released unharmed.

A 5 :gg: award has been dispatched for the capture of this terrorist.

-----------------------
Rules:
Not falling for that again:
Remove Demand: Media from the Terror deck

The Public wants him captured:
Remove Sniper, Take the Shot! from the conversation deck

Make sure he has nowhere to go:
Remove Escape Tunnel from Escape Demand deck

Cornered Rat:
Play with only 9 Red Terror cards

------------------------

First to capture him in the comments section wins the GG.  

I lost last night because of the stinkin&#039; escape tunnel (I tried to get him out with 1 red card left by rolling 5 dice, but only got 1 success!  So I finished with just a 1/3 chance of capturing him....)</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing a lot of [thing=146021][/thing] horror lately.  First I wanted to test out the 1 investigator game using the new reference cards.

[ImageID=2852889 small]

I&#039;ve never found playing 1 investigator to work very well.  You just can&#039;t move around the map fast enough.  With the above revision you now spawn 2 clues instead of 1 clue.  This would address how difficult it was to solve mysteries, but would it be enough to make 1 investigator worthwhile?  

After 4 attempts I can definitively state that IT DOES NOT!  [thing=146021][/thing] with a solo investigator just doesn&#039;t work.  All it takes is a rumor or a mystery with an epic monster to make the game annoying and usually impossible.  San Francisco is a great city, but when the Tick Toc Men show up outside of Sydney you are going to spend several turns and likely have multiple bad things happen to you as you make the long journey to Australia.  It is just a boring slog where you rarely feel like you might win.

So I&#039;m giving up the idea that a solo investigator is worth doing.

Next up is trying out the [thing=181817][/thing] expansion which arrived this week.  I opened the box and mixed everything in immediately!  All these new cards and investigators!  Fantastic!

And well... everything is mixed in.  Yep.  There we go.  I wonder when the next expansion is coming out?  I sure am looking forward to it...

It is a good expansion and anyone who really likes [thing=146021][/thing] is going to want it.  Though after [thing=164167][/thing], Under the Pyramid just doesn&#039;t really feel all that expansive.  When I opened Mountains I had Prelude Cards and Focus Tokens!  Elements that enhanced every game I played.  Plus you had a Sideboard and Adventure Cards.  I don&#039;t use them all the time, but they are neat additions.  Under the Pyramid just has more of all that, but nothing new really.  Impairment Tokens are fine and all except they are just a way for the game to be meaner to me.

Maybe it is for the best to have expansions like [thing=154842][/thing] and [thing=181817][/thing] which just disappear into the rest of the game.  They add variety without bloating the game with new rules and mechanics.  I like them, I will always buy them, but man they are not sexy at all.

[b]TLDR[/b]

1) Don&#039;t play as 1 investigator.  4 investigators are the only way to fly.

2) If you only have the base game I would buy [thing=164167][/thing] first, then [thing=177182][/thing], then [thing=154842][/thing] and finally [thing=181817][/thing].</body>

	<body>Welp, another play in the bucket. On Sunday, I completely hosed my desktop computer. This really annoyed me because I was heavily in the mood to play [thing=74501][/thing] (with DarthMod) all day. Ah well :(

Having Sunday evening free (after an afternoon of making my PC worse and worse), I pulled this down and set it up. Started playing through as Tovak. I played through the first day and enjoyed it. What is great about this game is how quickly that first level up comes, how quickly you start feeling that you&#039;re getting more powerful.

I didn&#039;t end up playing again until Tuesday night and finished up Wednesday morning. I had an EXCELLENT time playing this bad boy. The only frustrating thing is how much experience you need to be good at it so you can cease making subtle mistakes that are fatal in the long run. 

Here&#039;s game end:

If you look at the bottom of the pic, you can see one of the components of my Broken Token organizer. What a beautiful thing to have. 

I really want to play this again but it&#039;s such a commitment!</body>

	<body>Decided to play the [b]Home Sweet Home[/b] objective this morning.  In this scenario you have to build 10 barricades at the colony and 1 barricade at each location.  You 6 rounds to pull it off.  I played the non-hardcore side.  I generally prefer non-hardcore in [thing=150376][/thing] because I enjoy having a chance at winning.

[center][imageid=2875499 medium][/center]

I always play 2-handed.  And when I solo Dead of Winter I never select my survivors.  I don&#039;t even do the draft.  I just deal out 3 survivors to each hand.  Let luck fall wherever it wants.

Left hand gave me the Sheriff, Fireman and Construction Worker.  Ashley Ross, the construction worker, is perfect for this scenario because she can build one barricade per turn without spending a die.

Right hand gave me the Mayor, Police Dispatcher and Nurse.

[center][imageid=2875511 medium][/center]

Luck was kind to me this morning.  I kept Left Hand at the colony for most of the game to clear out zombies and build barricades there.  Right-hand sent the Nurse and Dispatcher out to the police station and hospital respectively.  They gathered weapons and medicine to support Left Hand.

They also found a Mop which they gave to the Mayor and made him clean up the colony most turns.  He was a pretty unpopular Mayor before the zombie apocalypse so this was good for morale.

This was the first game I&#039;ve played where I didn&#039;t lose any Survivors.  It was close and we ran into some nasty Crossroads because my ability to run the Colony apparently sucks.  I have former military essentially launching a coup and other people handing out old government fliers telling everyone that all hope is dead.  

But I also got to meet Maude the zombie who inadvertently kept my colony from starving (no we didn&#039;t eat her).

But we won thanks to a great group of survivors and a good dose of luck.  I really wish I had brought [thing=146021][/thing] downstairs to watch.  &quot;See?  You don&#039;t have to be a dick all the time, Eldritch!  This is why Dead of Winter gets a broken token insert and you don&#039;t!!&quot;

[center][imageid=2875513 medium][/center]

There was one time where Gabriel Diaz got frostbite while fighting zombies at the colony.  We were out of medicine and the round was over.  At the start of the next turn he took another wound due to the frostbite effect.  One more turn he would die.  Janet Taylor, who was already wounded, risk her life to find medicine at the Hospital and bring it back to the colony.  She took a wound in the process, but made it back in time to save him.

Guess who gets to hook up with a Fireman tonight?  You go girl!

It is February.  Love is in air.

I love [thing=150376][/thing] so I got the Broken Token insert, added sleeves (KMC Perfect Fit), all 3 promo characters and replaced the blue dice with dice that look like ice cubes (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011WOEL2).  Because the blue dice were ugly.

[center][imageid=2875515 medium][/center]

Great game full of great stories.  Easy to play and with the Broken Token insert it sets up and tears down fast.  Plus sometimes you can play as a dog.</body>

	<body>Played through a handful of Viral games over the last few days.

I was very close on quite a few games, I&#039;m definitely improving on my decision making in this game and managed to stay funded fairly well each time.

Then sometimes you just get a game where...

[IMG]https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/content/10833024[/IMG]

In my last game I had a bunch of duplicate molecules to start so a couple of turns later I solved them all for $16, making sure I purchased a few things for the lab along the way so I could keep as much of that as possible. My DT rolls were legendary. I had quite a decent staff to work with (Brown, Foster, Monroe, interns) and on the last turn Adam Schlinker&#039;s token eliminated a mutation that allowed me to clear the last molecule from the board for a victory.</body>

	<body>After playing that Mage Knight monster, I needed something short and quick but involving. P:TC is more and more my go-to game for this. Nothing to watch out for, no weird rule exceptions (except for treating all dice of a cured color), it&#039;s so straightforward and gives some good Leacock disaster management. 

Played on heroic difficulty. Not too pleased with the random draw of 4 roles (no scientist? No medic????) but.....

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Skql9cF.jpg[/IMG]

BOOYAH! Suck it, apocalypse!

Great game. I need to break out Forbidden Desert again because I used to love that game but my more recent plays have found me completely flummoxed as to how to balance the thirst with everything else; it&#039;s felt way too luck prone but I am pretty sure it&#039;s my own failings and not the game. Maybe now, with my Loyang and Pandemic:TC (and even my better than normal Mage Knight performance), my mind has returned!</body>

	<body>Finally got the chance to play this again.  TWICE!

It&#039;s not long and pretty easy (though I did have the tendency to over think things and spent some time reading all the rules posts in the forums - not many).  I ended up having to play it how I THINK the spirit of the game wants it to be played.

Played two games. 
[b]1)[/b] LOST horribly the first time out.  Ran through all the City Sectors and hadn&#039;t found all the locations for the Device before running out of time.  Also, with the ever-changing modular board, I had to go round about ways of getting back to Society Hall to build my strength back up. 
[b]2)[/b] WON the second time with lots of time to spare.  I lucked out and found The Hive right off the bat (which allows you to gain the Map, which I did. Up to 3 City Sectors 1 hour turn time.)  So I was able to breeze through the city sectors, finding a whole bunch of gears, and again was luckily able to draw most of the needed locations right off the bat.

:thumbsup: Short little game with a lot of theme and replayability.  Tough to beat.
:thumbsup: Beautiful components.

:thumbsdown: Rules are written I guess about as clearly as they can be, but there are still some things that need interpretation.

:thumbsdown: Someone wrote a review that said the game is more reactionary - the player just simply reacts to what happens rather than making any real choices about decisions.  I can see that somewhat. But I still enjoy it.</body>

	<body>First face off against the robot. I received this game today, after reading so much about it I finally had to buy it :laugh:

And I&#039;m really glad I did. After trying to understand the rulebook, I just ended up watching a video on youtube which made things quite clear and with the small rulebook for the robot I played my first game. 

My final score was a 32, against the robot who had 24, in easy difficulty, so I&#039;m sure that I got very lucky after what I read or missed some rule, or just both :laugh:

I&#039;ll definitely take a look again in the rulebook now that I understand much more after playing, and I&#039;m very excited to keep playing this, so many possibilities, I have to say that I was a bit lost at first, but I ended up doing a small strategy. I know this game is going to be on the table a lot after this first game.

[imageid=2875744]

Edit: 2nd game

This time the robot claimed vengeance and wiped the floor with me :sauron: (34-44). Now that the game is set up I have to try to beat it again. :p

Edit: 3rd game

Apparently it wasn&#039;t enough. Lost again by a ridiculous 24-44 :shake:. Damn is hard and addicting this game (just one more...) :laugh:

Edit: 4th game

[imageid=2878646]

With some luck, I managed to win again, 40-34. I went full military conquest, with a lot of rebel planets, and with the Galactic Imperium I managed to earn quite a few points. Now I can go to sleep, and face the robot again tomorrow :p</body>

	<body>First play of the month. Life has been interfering with my plays. Needless to say I got two plays of this one in as Boston and got pummeled 4-0 and 4-1.

I did three opening buy rounds each but the freaking AI would counter every good play I made. It was awful... Ly fun. When I get beat but enjoy getting beat so soundly by a game that makes me want to reset and try again I know it&#039;s a keeper. Really like this one. Am glad it isn&#039;t easy and look forward to many more solo plays. Going to buy a few team decks from my favorite real life teams just to have them. If I can find them easily.

No pictures because there isn&#039;t much to see really. Click on images for the game and you will get the gist plus my table is a crisp black so nothing spectacular there either. </body>

	<body>After 2 aborted plays of this (one due to messing up the rules and one due to lack of time) I finally got in 3 plays of this today.

I used just the ship and licence cards from the base game with the solo captain cards from Arctic Bounty.

The first game resulted in defeat. I scored 53 but T.C scored 55 and Kirkman scored 59.

[ImageID=2875504 medium]
I definitely made some mistakes, I failed to get enough boats out and didn&#039;t manage the licence auction properly.

Tried again and things went splendidly.

[ImageID=2875505 medium]
I got lots of boats out, managed the auction phase a lot better and got a good win. I scored 75, T.C 52 and Kirkman 22 (he only launched 1 boat).

One final game tonight whilst my wife was out. Did well again and got another win.

[ImageID=2875969 medium]
Me 62, T.C 49 and Kirkman 20 (again just 1 boat launched).

I really liked all 3 plays. Someone had said it has a similar feel to RftG and San Juan (I love both, although only play San Juan on my phone) and they are right.

A great combination of decision making and mechanics has won me over.

Yet another unplayed game that I&#039;ve enjoyed. My storage problems continue. :D

I&#039;m looking forward to trying out the cards from the expansion.

:thumbsup: A relatively quick playing game that gives me a nice brain workout.

:thumbsdown: Theme isn&#039;t a winner but if the gameplay is right I can enjoy a game anyway.</body>

	<body>Been a while, but this was my first play with the [thing=180049][/thing] expansion material mixed in. Played my long-suffering troll/human combo, with one being the new Drone Rigger (samurai bent) and one the Social Adept (Mage-style). Played Crossfire, loaded up the black market with the new gear... and... managed my first ever win. 

And it feels like I had to have screwed some thing up, because I never win at anything in this game. 

I wonder if some of the new cards offer a bit more in the way of balancing, because I&#039;ve never even come close before. I was still very lucky, of course, with my human staggered (as per usual). Came down to the wire, but seeing off the demolitions expert allowed me to strip another antagonist of one level of damage... which cued me up to murderise the Security Goons (who in turn allow one runner to heal one health point). 

Good fun, even if I had to stare at my hand for five minutes to work out how I was going to pulverise my tormentors. And I [i]finally[/i] have seven karma to spend on upgrades! 

Now I get to sweat on using the stickers or not. :shake:

	<body>Got this in from KS a few weeks ago, and finally got around to sleeving the cards earlier this week.  That set me up for a go last night.

I played with the recommended starting cards, and ended up crushing the &quot;AI&quot; Duke, 84-23.  (I did happen to get the opposing Duke as the one who receives bonuses for Domains, and, since I didn&#039;t allow him to manage to gain any, he failed miserably!).  Hopefully next time it won&#039;t be quite so lopsided, but I had fun nonetheless.  

In case anyone is interested, the next game in the series Villages of Valeria is live now on KS and is kicking butt: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dailymagicgames/villages-of-valeria?ref=nav_search

:thumbsup: the artwork is amazing (by &quot;The Mico&quot;)
:thumbsup: dice chucking with personalized 16mm dice :bd6-1::bd6-6:
:thumbsup: fantasy retheme of Machi Koro, with way better mechanics to boot
:thumbsup: good replayability with variable monsters, domains, and citizens...plus few expansions coming/already out
:thumbsdown: first solo game was ridiculously easy; hopefully not the norm!
:thumbsdown::thumbsup: some cards had &quot;the Valeria Curl&quot; (not properly dehumidified in manufacturing), though the sleeving pretty much took care of that, and DMG is doing a phenomenal job replacing any curled cards for backers who aren&#039;t satisfied</body>

	<body>This was a continuation of the slight trend from last week of playing games that I hadn&#039;t played in a long time, this one just over two weeks from being a full year apart.

I got a little bit of a late start and had a few other distractions in between, so it got set up as a simple two-player team game.   Each team got a pair of Heroes starting at a mid-range level, and I intentionally picked ones that I couldn&#039;t remember having played before - a pair of Quickness-equipped Necropolis warriors, versus a pair of Dwarves.

On stats alone it looked like the Necros should have run away with the game, but their speed and greater hitting power led to them biting off more than they could chew a few different times, which ended up slowing them down much more than the Dwarves who had no choice but to take a more efficient and calculated path.

[imageid=2874781 medium]

In the end it was the Dwarves that came out ahead, with three treasures collected for $2475 compared to just two for $1725 for the Necros.  The Dwarves were also in much better shape, leaving on nearly full health while their opponents were battered and each was just one or two clicks from death.

All four had reached Level 5 by the end.

[u][b]Necropolis (98)[/b][/u]
Rax Coldstone - Level 2 (53)
Ribhan Crag - Level 2 (45)

[u][b]Dwarves (97)[/b][/u]
Terk - Level 3 (42)
Jarl Stonehill - Level 4 (55)

-----------------

:thumbsup:   Built on an extremely modular system that can support a wide variety of player numbers in just about any format you can think of:  player vs. player, players vs. DM, full coop, and even solo.
:thumbsup:   HUGE variety of figures available to use as Heroes and Mage Spawn (monsters), each with its own built-in stats.   ([i]Multiply that by about 10 if you add in everything from the original [thing=864][/thing][/i]).

:thumbsup::thumbsdown:  All combat is based on a 2d6 system, so the odds of success are generally known but with enough variability to keep you on your toes.  If you like or at least don&#039;t mind dice, that&#039;s great.  Not so much if you hate dice.

:thumbsdown:  Long out of print collectible miniatures game, so hard to find, especially if you&#039;re looking for specifics.
:thumbsdown:  Setup is a bit of a chore unless you do a lot of fudging of point values to avoid having to sort figures ahead of time.

My offensive Tactics/Lore deck is obviously broken for Passage Through Mirkwood.

I find that I enjoy very much a game (or two) of this game now and then. I think that it is not a game to play over and over, but once every couple of weeks or after a longer game can be very enjoyable.

Now over to abductor pack 3.</body>

	<body>Played this for the first time in what seemed like forever last night. Included the [thing=40849][/thing] roles and special events, but none of the other expansion stuff.

Randomly selecting roles got me the Scientist, the Operations Expert, and the Researcher, who got a New Assignment about 2/3 of the way through the game and became the Containment Specialist. This switch came right as it was most needed and allowed me to keep the red infections down long enough to get the final cure in for the win.

I don&#039;t play this one nearly enough for how much I enjoy it. Maybe this play will help to keep it in my mind.</body>

	<body>Yesterday I picked up the Villains expansion at my FLGS so I tried it out.  I played 2 games yesterday but only 1 using the villain cards.  I&#039;m surprised, but I won both games.

The first game was against Chokepoint and it was surprisingly easy.  I doubt my heroes took more than 6 points of damage total among all of them.  That was even though I was using the Sentinels so I was playing 6 heroes total.  I just got lucky that all the damage ended up going to the same character and I was able to heal him quickly.

My 2nd game was against 3 villains.  It was fun and I was sure I was going to lose, but I did somehow manage to win the game.  Once the 1st villain goes down, it&#039;s so much easier.

Boy I really like this game.

I&#039;ve been crazy busy lately.  I&#039;m not sure why really but I find I have very little free time for gaming or posting on BGG.  I&#039;m sitting at home on my computer only because I took the day off today.  Been doing all sorts of chores.  I was hoping to game this morning, but nope... gotta run!

:thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup: I just love the variability this game has with so many decks to choose from.  I think all my favorite games use that similar mechanic of only playing with a few items to change up the game..

[thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=42452][/thing] come to mind.  I only wish Rattus had a good solitaire option.  The one variant I tried was only okay.</body>

	<body>[b]Extraction Team, You Had ONE ****** Job![/b]

I [i]may[/i] be slowly gaining some competence in this game. Today, at least, I did manage to start with two games that came down the last roll, and which went according to some rough plan up to that roll.

The first attempt, I took care of Arkayne reasonably well by building up to a favorable sniper shot and ceding to an escape demand. I then used a similar approach to extract the last hostage and force the 2nd in command to surrender (or be killed outright), with a 75% chance of success. I guess I should have tried a different tack to grab some re-roll cards, because sure enough, I didn&#039;t even get a single 4 during the extraction attempt (I was counting on that to be able to cash in two spare cards to get me over the hump). Those bozos on the extraction team blew it, and the abductor got away.

The second attempt didn&#039;t go as smoothly, but I was able to kill Arkayne and focus on the 2nd in command with some time to spare. The terror deck reset the threat level, so I thought I would try to get the guy to surrender after he let the final hostage go. In retrospect, it would have been easier just to kill the guy. But I just managed to cash in re-rolls and spare cards to capture him on the last roll (the 4 did show up that time).

Talk about a night-and-day difference to the experience of the other games I occupy myself with. Exhilarating, stressful, frustrating stuff. On to a new batch of abductors! But not before I give the head of the extraction team a piece of my mind.</body>

	<body>So this is what I&#039;m trying to jam between stuff at work.

And yes, my ultimate goal is to go all the way to High Frontier.

Right now I have large nocturnal lizards with creepy teeth and parental tendencies as well as an equally large lizard that has all that along with HUGE claws, though it prefers the daylight.

[imageid=2876923medium]

Sadly we&#039;re being hampered by these little creatures that always seem to find us by making these annoying squeaking sounds.  And they can eat our kids using these long gooey tongues!  Ewwww!  They seem to have a lot of energy, and that extention on their spine seems to keep them upright and centered, so they are hard to take in a fight, even with our teeth and claws.  Worse still, they&#039;ve recently begun taking us down from a distant, hunting us using objects to do the killing for them.  Quite unsportsmanlike, if you ask me.  I liked the other mammals.  The ones that had the good nature to DIE when the meteor hit.

To be continued....

[b]And we&#039;re continued![/b]
You know what we need?  Brains!  That&#039;s what!  These little furry things have got to be the ugliest creatures ever, and they are EVERYWHERE!  I swear, if that ocean over there didn&#039;t happen, I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be in every corner of this planet.  They seem to develop a new way to solve a problem every week, and if that doesn&#039;t work, they actually use their smarts to do it!  I actually saw them growing food intentionally!  Did you know you could do that?  I thought our bug eating sticks were good.  I&#039;ve got tool envy.

So after that huge volcano heated everything up and killed a large portion of the world, I decided we aught to get smart.  Looks like we have a bit of an uphill climb against the furry ones, but you never know.  This stick can get pretty big.

[imageid=2882889medium]

Megafauna game ended when we ran out of Mesozoic tiles.  Luckily the penultimate tile was a large volcano that raised the greenhouse and killed quite a few white critters.  We were actually tied for dinomeeples on the board, so we split the VP tiles.  I won the Megafauna segment based on VP from cards, which was the only way I could have since there was a white meeple on pretty much every land mass on the board.  The transfer over to Origins is a bit of a slog, but now that we&#039;re there, I&#039;m going to have to refamiliarize myself with the rules, but it&#039;s Eklund, how complicated can it be?

[b] Well that was that [/b]

A brief blip in history, the lizard people were a savage race, using their greater numbers to take down the hairy-ones and enslave them in quick order, effectively wiping the species from the planet.  Unfortunately, this aggressive stance could not sustain them, and even after a brief stint being able to cultivate their own seeds, the clans devolved further and further into warring nations and eventually self destructed into chaos.

I think I lasted, what, 5 turns?  I did a silverback action to get pieces on the board and take out the mammals.  I had a card in my hand with a fecundity decrease, so it seemed like a good idea at the time.  However, my next several chaos rolls were a 1, and all my cubes melted off of the map like a species unable to adapt to a changing climate.

I bet those mammals would have survived.  Shame I bashed their head in with a stick.  Guess that was a poor long-term strategy.</body>

	<body>Time for some Alien action, tonight.

Played the second scenario using randomly chosen Avatars of Executive and Medic.

I found a lot of the more expensive cards filling up the HQ early on, and this gave the aliens a chance to fill the Complex. After this, it seemed I was just hanging on. Later on in the game, I found that both Avatars each had one hit point remaining, but managed to hang on for another few turns. The alien queen had arrived by this point, and finished the game off.

A win to the aliens....

	<body>Did some solo deck building yesterday. I got in a 2 handed solo game of [thing=159109][/thing] on my iPad. I lost in round 9 on the very last enemy of the first group. It was a very close game where I think I only let 2 enemies actually get through to directly attack the base, but lost to all the direct damage abilities of the aliens. That&#039;s a tough way to lose, but I just needed to buy more direct damage items instead of focusing on the ground combat. Very tight game. I am considering buying at least the soldier expansion because I would like more variety in that aspect of the game, but I&#039;m not sure if it will get enough play to justify it. Ok on to physical board games.

Shadowrift is a game that has been on my radar for a long time. I have almost bought in to the past 3 kickstarters but the Game Saluteness of the campaigns just always held me back, which is disappointing because the designer seems like a great guy and is very active and helpful on bgg. Anyway I traded for it last year and got my 3rd play in last night.

For those unfamiliar with Shadowrift, it plays a bit like a tower defense deck builder with the deck building much in line with Dominion or Thunderstone. Basically, there are bad guys (6 different enemies groups that you choose from at the start of the game) trying to destroy your little village. These enemies slowly appear and march through the village causing all kinds of havoc (mostly by killing your villagers and leaving the town littered with corpses). You must keep the town from being overrun with corpses while trying to either build 8 walls to protect it or close the shadowrifts which have mysteriously appeared to spawn the terrible monstrosities which are plaguing your village. The shadowrifts are equal to the # of players and get shuffled into the monster deck (I shuffled 1 into the top half and 1 into the bottom half for this game). If you can close the shadowrifts or build all the walls you win. You defend the village by using your hand of cards to attack enemies, learn skills (buy new cards from the pool in the middle, think dominion or TSA), build walls, and recruit new villagers. The villagers are a really cool part of the game. There a 5 people in the village each turn. At the start they are all 10 villagers in the deck are helpful and you can get aid from them during your turn, which is great because it doesn&#039;t take an action to use the villagers. Just like Dominion many of the really good cards require an action to use and you only get 1 per turn so you must be careful about what you buy and the make up of your deck. Thankfully, there are villagers to help you out and you can even recruit more villagers. 2 traveling villagers appear each turn that you can recruit (for a price of course), but sometimes these travelers are dastardly infiltrators which will sneak into your village trying to wreak havoc. Also, your villagers can and will die and get replaced with a corpse card. If you ever populate the village and have no good villagers (all corpses or infiltrators) then you lose. With 6 different enemies and a decent variety of possible market cards the combinations and variability offered in the game are pretty wide. 

I play the game 2 handed solitaire. There are some variants and the designer has even discussed his thoughts on true solitaire rules if anyone is interested. The basic scaling is the enemy power part of the game. The enemies gain power based on the number of players and each enemy has a power level that must be paid before it will enter the village and start rampaging. Therefore, the enemies in a 2 player game appear slower than higher player counts which seems to offset having 1 or 2 less hands of cards pretty well. However, it&#039;s not perfect because there are cards that can inflate how much power the monsters gain and these are flat increases. With monsters gaining power each round, the rounds move quicker in a 2 player game and the flat increase has a greater effect. Also, I think the wall building win condition is probably near impossible in true solo. Anyway some combination of these things makes playing true solitaire with the base rules basically broken.

Enough intro, on to my play. I played this game with one of the recommended setups, fighting against the Drow and using all the loot cards along with some strong attacks. The Drow are the weakest of the enemies in the game from what I can gather and these loot cards are pretty great because they don&#039;t require an action to play and sit in front of you like ongoing cards that you can use whenever you want. Unfortunately, the loot cards are expensive, they can only be bought with gold, which takes 2 resources to acquire first. Fortunately, gold can be shared between players unlike the cards in your hand. I spent the first couple rounds when the enemies weren&#039;t in play yet acquiring gold and some nice skill/attack cards and eventually getting player 1 a nice loot card. In round 3 the first enemy appeared. I wasn&#039;t strong enough to dispatch him right away but thankfully his abilities and attacks weren&#039;t going to be terrible. Also, the next enemy card was going to cost 7 power, which meant that it wouldn&#039;t appear for 4 rounds barring anything weird happening (but it would be a real bastard if it did make it into our nice little town) . This gave me time to keep building the deck and finish off the first monster. I even used the explore action to kick the big bad monster to the bottom of the monster deck before it could sashay into the village. This just meant that the weaker monsters that appeared next came more quickly but was probably worth it.

I was able to keep things relatively under control through the mid game although it got a bit touchy at times and by the time I found the first shadowrift my decks were humming along and I felt pretty good. I closed that rift quickly and just had to search through the monsters to find the other. There were a few corpses rolling through the village and I needed to try to get that under control but mostly there was very little threat as I tried to cycle the enemies to find the other rift (I was all in on the rifts, the walls weren&#039;t really an option at this point). I recruited the gravedigger and grabbed some loot to help manage the bodies in the village. In the end once that rift came I closed it immediately for a win.

Comparing my 2 handed solo deckbuilders today I must say that Shadowrift captures me much more. There are just so many interesting decisions every turn. Mostly it&#039;s because of the villagers. Those traveling villagers have awesome abilities but they often take both players their entire resources for a round to recruit which means you didn&#039;t improve either deck. Every buying phase is difficult, there are almost always multiple options and they all seem like viable choices. There is also more variety to Shadowrift. The base game of Xenoshyft is more limited with the enemies and you always have the exact same soldiers to recruit. 

:thumbsup: Plenty of interesting decisions
:thumbsdown: production quality could be better, especially the rulebook and the card text could be crisper (the 1st edition was basically self-published, a 2nd edition which improves on all this is supposedly coming but it KSed with Game Salute in charge so who knows what will actually happen)
:thumbsdown: plays best 2 or 3 handed, which means lots of shuffling plus extra shuffling with this one because of the villager deck

Overall I really like this game. It seems well balanced for cooperative play and has plenty of combinations for replayability. It gives me that true Dominionish deckbuilding I like in a difficult co-op. It takes some patience and work to get the rules, but there is a 2nd edition rulebook that probably makes it better.</body>

	<body>We are having lovely weather today, and I decided to head out to the park for lunch and a game.  Unfortately, the sunshine is accopanied by 17 mph winds, so I thought had to give up my plan to play. It was all looking very bleak until I realized I had a game in my bag that didn&#039;t need cards!  Yay Delve :D

I did not do as well or as poorly as I have in the past, but it was still a respectable play.

	<body>I haven&#039;t had too much time for gaming, so far this month. So, this game took me two days to complete. I threw in the [b][thing=182732]Mercury expansion[/thing][/b] for this game, and there&#039;s really no reason to not use it from the start. It adds a new planet to explore and some new mission cards. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t get any missions to Mercury. My aims were for the Moon and for Venus. 

However, both the Moon and Venus were a harsh mistress. They would have destroyed any craft I landed there. The atmospheres were too hostile, and I&#039;m glad I surveyed them before trying to land a probe. Which left me with only the manned mission to Mars. However, I didn&#039;t work toward Mars, or humans in space, this game. My focus was on surveying and samples. I was also experimenting with Ion Thrusters. When I learned I couldn&#039;t land on Venus, I was able to shift my craft&#039;s trajectory to Ceres. I landed and picked up samples, but couldn&#039;t get back off the planet. Instead, I let things sit there for a future mission to worry about. 

At the last minute, I shifted all mission personnel to launch a manned mission to Mars, but by 1972, NASA had already lost the space race. 

This is a terrific game. It&#039;s exciting and completely different than anything else I&#039;ve played. It&#039;s also exactly what I wanted from a space-themed game. I also really enjoy how half the game is spent working on a mission-planning worksheet. Then you try and make it happen. I haven&#039;t quite figured out how to properly plan multiple missions at the same time. Or smaller, test missions while building up to the big mission. I&#039;ll get there 

This game does make my brain hurt. It&#039;s work to go through everything. You need math, logic, foresight, patience, and an eraser. All these things are part of what makes this game great. However, I also think these things might cause it from getting much table time. This is a game that I&#039;ll have to plan ahead for. Maybe not all the time, but this last game really took some work. 

This game is excellent. I was right. It gives me exactly what I wanted from High Frontier. I have no desire, any longer for High Frontier, because Leaving Earth gives me exactly what I want from a serious space travel game. </body>

	<body>Wow. With the solo scenarios from the Invasion expansion, Orleans has rocketed up in my appreciation of it as a solo Euro. And this is after I&#039;ve only dipped my toes in the shallow end of the pool with the level 1 (easy) scenarios, Dignitaries and the promo scenario, Reise Nach Tours. 

Even the easy scenarios require juggling aspects of deck/bag building, resource management, and worker placement. Though the events of the scenarios are fixed instead of randomized as in the main game, this doesn&#039;t seem to affect their replayability too much as variability happens with bag draws—and in Dignitaries at least (and perhaps others later on), you&#039;re only allowed a randomized subset of the place tiles. 

You could approach each game with the same strategy every single time, of course, in which case the easy scenarios won&#039;t satisfy you. If you like to explore other paths, even the easy scenarios will entertain you. 

Later this month I hope to move on to the harder scenarios. </body>

	<body>So I&#039;ve gone from &quot;it&#039;s decent, probably not staying in my collection though&quot; to &quot;it&#039;s pleasant, and staying in my collection.&quot; 

I can probably pin the &quot;blame&quot; for this on four factors: 

1. Playing games that reminded me that &quot;pleasant and somewhat light on theme with some strategic options&quot; is better than &quot;heavy on theme, excruciatingly frustrating, and laced with being clobbered over the head with luck.&quot; I&#039;m looking at you, Warhammer Quest: Adventure Card Game. 

2. Playing games that reminded me that publishers can really screw up a game by under-developing it and/over-extending it, and thus I began to really cherish the publishers that allow a design to be what it is—rather than, say, take the lovely Micro Space Empires and bloat it to Galaxy Command with a much higher price tag than it deserved (and I&#039;m very lenient when it comes to game pricing—like, I would value Star Wars: Imperial Assault at the full $100 and VPG&#039;s gold box line at their listed MSRP. The original Micro Space Empires I&#039;d value as a $10 game, not a $35 game). 

3. Playing games where the art was, to my eyes, mediocre (again, Galaxy Command) and the components were at best barely adequate (again, Galaxy Command) reminded me to cherish the games that are works of arts with decent game play, which Shakespeare certainly is. 

4. Not being able to reach 30 points yet seeing how it might be possible just whets my propensity to replay a game, and Shakespeare is tricksy in that regard still. 

Did my bar lower for keeping games around? 

Well. No. I&#039;m still drop-kicking games to the trade/sell pile (though in some cases I&#039;ve given up and am slating them to be recycled for parts—again, looking at you, Galaxy Command). I just like to think I&#039;m being more reasonable about it now. </body>

	<body>I&#039;m starting to play all my Rosenberg games to see which ones to get rid of, and it looks bad. 

That is to say, Rosenberg is still a genius designer and most of his games click with me so well that I&#039;ll be lucky if I can even think of one to put on the trade pile. 

Glass Road I thought was promising as an expendable title, but no, it had to go all interesting and teasing on me. Trying to make the best of the building offer is an excellent exercise, and especially in combination with the resource wheels and associated mechanisms, makes Glass Road a wonderful Euro with meat, and yet it&#039;s very easy to get multiple games in. 

Somehow it feels like it paces much like Baseball Highlights 2045, though the games are completely different. But the pacing is almost entirely the same—it&#039;s eerie. Try it some time, if you have both games. 

What I like to do is to go through three churns of building tiles. That is to say, I play three games, and discard all revealed building tiles and just use the rest of the tiles for the next game as opposed to shuffling all the tiles together again. More games to get in, and I suppose it could be considered a mini-campaign at that point. 

Plus there are so many building tiles that this is entirely possible to do and never need to recycle building tiles once. And that variability also helps give Glass Road its sense of addiction. 

Wonderful game.</body>

Ah, Dice Masters. It kind of sits in the uncanny valley of thematic expression in board games, kind of where the Legendary system sits as well. Legendary never pleased me for the same reasons that the Cerebus deckbuilding system doesn&#039;t please me—they feel too abstract for the themes they attempt to represent. I don&#039;t doubt that the systems are flexible enough to provide some thematic hooks, but they just don&#039;t do it for me. 

Dice Masters doesn&#039;t do it for me, either. Which is why I tend to need the extra mechanisms in the D&amp;D series to be entertained by the game. The D&amp;D Dice Masters series is perhaps the most mature in terms of mechanisms added, but I&#039;m thinking of the experience mechanism mostly, which has yet to show up in any other Dice Masters games. (And thematically, it wouldn&#039;t fit in those other games anyways. Which is a really odd thing to say about Dice Masters, but as I said, it&#039;s not lacking in theme—it just does theme in a very abstract manner.) 

I liked Quarriors, but ultimately those are all going on the trade pile. I hoped Dice Masters would be better, and it so, so is, but ... 

It&#039;s just such a unique game. I feel like I ought to keep it just for that. But to be honest I&#039;ll probably be better off selling my singles for store credit (meagre store credit at that) at Cool Stuff Inc. 

The dice are scrumptious though. 

But ultimately I probably shouldn&#039;t keep a game for that reason. And I probably shouldn&#039;t keep a game just because I think it&#039;s the only dice building game that works. 

Ah, decisions, decisions.... </body>

	<body>Soloable with multiple variants; I enjoy this high score variant the most - [thread=61638][/thread]

I tried the F.O.E. variant, but without an intelligent bluffing mechanism, you&#039;re just blindly guessing. The AI then takes advantage of this, but not because you&#039;ve failed to anticipate it—which is a major failing in the game, because you simply can&#039;t compensate. You only get two randomly chosen character cards to choose from per round, and even with the temporary 3-card advantage from possibly selecting the King, it&#039;s simply not enough choice. At all. 

The high score variant, on the other hand, does remove the bluffing aspect but preserves special powers and city building. Mix in the Dark City (aka the starred purple buildings in recent editions of Citadels) buildings and you have enough combos between the character powers and the purple buildings to exploit. 

I mixed up the variant further by adding the expansion character cards (in particular, cards 4*, 5*, 6*, 7*, 8*, and 9* [Artist]) for a total of 12 character cards. Deal out 6 in one round, and then 6 in the second round, instead of using the same 6 characters in both rounds. I shuffle the characters and arrange it so that duplicate numbers are moved to the second round and replaced. 

It&#039;s quite a pleasing, fast filler this way. Stays on the shelf for now. </body>

	<body>I enjoy this game immensely for such a fluffy light game. Perhaps it&#039;s because of the theming, but I view it as one of the best pure applications of the push-your-luck mechanism in a way that doesn&#039;t involve rolling dice over and over and over. 

(I have nothing against dice; I like Nemo&#039;s War just fine. It&#039;s just nice to have cards for a change.) 

A PnP filler I&#039;m happy to keep around. </body>

	<body>I&#039;m terrible at Race for the Galaxy. I don&#039;t know why I still play it, sometimes, as I lack the understanding necessary to do well at all. On the other hand, I don&#039;t exactly play it intensely, and if I did, I&#039;d probably be able to beat other folks at the game. As it is, I usually score below 15-20 points. 

The RFTG AI just doesn&#039;t let up. None of the bots are easier than the others. You need to understand each one, and the solo game manages to keep the &quot;try to anticipate what your opponent will do, and then don&#039;t duplicate effort&quot; aspect of the multiplayer game, and it&#039;s quite vital to doing well. As is &quot;try to anticipate what your opponent needs, and don&#039;t give them that opportunity unless they can make as little use of it as possible.&quot; 

Brilliant AI, lots of replayability even if you never get the other expansions. I currently have the other expansions separated out, as I kind of like the concept of them more than the implementation. But if I ever play the base game + Gathering Storm enough to get bored of the dozen home worlds (which is unlikely) I can access them as well, as they all have their own AIs too. </body>

	<body>A very enjoyable light game that gives me the Bohnanza feeling without having to bother with trading. The mechanisms here actually work pretty well for the solo player, and I really appreciate that this game exists. 

The cards are also incredibly nice, probably the highest quality cards in my collection, and that&#039;s saying something. 

This is actually play #14, since I found this last year and played it quite a bit, trying to win. My win rate is 3 out of 14 games. Today was a decisive victory, especially given that the Bean Mafia doubles their base score. Keeping their fields dry was a difficult endeavor, but it worked. 

This and Citadels (with a particular solo variant) will probably battle it out for Light Light Filler Card Game in my collection. I&#039;d probably give this the nod first, though. </body>

	<body>I found this a few hours ago elsewhere on this Geeklist, so, gave it a shot.

The following was set up after I played, with Jumbo cards. I played with regular, but might with Jumbo sometimes. They juuust fit.

[ImageID=2877400 medium]

I enjoyed this game. It takes longer than [thing=180387][/thing], so it won&#039;t see play as much, but was definitely thematic. I kept saying, I&#039;m gonna roll again . . .er, draw. Roll is fine, I&#039;m bowling!

It&#039;s a little mathy, in that you are adding this option, adding that option, trying to see what would be the best way to bowl your ball, the best path to take. On a day when I am more used up, and with all my issues, some days are like that, Dungeon Solitaire will win over Bowling. But it&#039;s great to add more variety to my Solitaire repertoire, because one is fun,but you need to eventually change it up. 

My daughter asked my, how many kinds of Solitaire are there? I said, you have no idea . . .

 120! Not bad . . .

[ImageID=2877399 large]

I used a spreadsheet score tracker, but frustrations with my kindle, and protected spreadsheet that often comes up when trying to do stuff, made me not like it so much. I did find that sometimes, this was because a checkbox had gotten filled in. But I also find, this new generation of kindle, to be a junky piece of inconsistent garbage, when you want to do, you know, the types ofthings most people want to do on a tablet. Stay away from Fifth gen Fire. This pic is a little cluttered but the other program, I couldn&#039;t get a screenshot at all. !#$!#+?#!#!!@$ kindle.

Um. (If you&#039;d spent hours and hours on the phone with customer service and had reps lie to you on multiple occasions, it&#039;d drive you nuts too!)

Ok, enough of that.

I&#039;m looking at t r ying the solo [thing=30367][/thing]. I need to relearn the game, though.

I tried [thing=75223][/thing], but my first go didn&#039;t go well. I&#039;ll give it another go. 

I&#039;m really looking at trying, besides more solo games, games good for two that are or can solo. The small footprint thread is also good. I got a good intro started and my tablet died, that was on me f or not plugging in. Lost the whole thing,ugh.</body>

	<body>I wanted something on the lighter front tonight and went with this. The only issue I have with it is that I need a better system to organize the cards. Since I have a lot of the expansions it ends up taking even more time to sort them out. Any suggestions for storage on this game? I may build a foam core solution but I&#039;m not sure yet.</body>

	<body>Played the bare bones version of this game over the past few nights (including a couple restarts), and have to say I really like it.  This is a game I&#039;ve seen over and over again on the solo PnP lists, but never really knew what I needed for files...everyone wants to make it look so [i]nice[/i].  It wasn&#039;t until Monday I actually found the basic sheets I needed to play.

It took me a couple trys to get the hang of the flow, but the game does have a nice hum to it.  The rules are fairly straight forward, if ambiguous at times (thought that&#039;s yet to scare me off a game [size=7]*cough* Dark Darker Darkest *cough*[/size]).  It&#039;s also quite satisfying to see my civilization start to grow as the game progresses, and even more satisfying when the Advances you take perfectly counter a lousy event draw (I&#039;m looking at you, Tribal War).  Looking forward to another round!</body>

[b]Passage through Mirkwood[/b] has been crushed.

Once I made a Spirit/Lore deck to specifically beat this scenario, I crushed it in the fourth turn. It was awesome! :D

Now, back to my battle deck to attempt [b]Journey along the Anduin[/b].


Man, this game really hits my [thing=47185][/thing] vibe. Which is great, because I loved that game. But I didn&#039;t have any trained opponents for it.

Score: Meriwether Lewis (me) = 48; Mackenzie BOT = 42
:thumbsup: quick turns; plays fast
:thumbsup: balanced
:thumbsup: great components
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: solo variant leaves player wanting but happy for a solo variant of any sort.  Kudos go out to: Oliver D. &quot;mildaene&quot; for its development.
Best played with 3 to 4 players

:d10-4: [b]I am continuing with my previous party of heroes (B-3: Boudica the Soldier, Bhavya the Acolyte, and Bahati the Archer) and also continuing the same adventure.[/b] (I am counting this as a separate game for purposes of my 10 x 10 challenge because of the length of play, not because I have ended the previous adventure (which I haven&#039;t).


[i]In the morning, while the party was eating their free hot breakfast provided by the innkeeper, several people in dirty but sturdy clothing approached their table.  

&quot;We have heard of your great deeds against the undead,&quot; said a woman who was apparently their spokesperson.  &quot;We are archaeologists, and we have been trying to excavate and study a local tomb of historical interest, but we have been constantly annoyed by the undead who hamper our efforts.&quot;

The heroes kept eating, and tried not to take notice of the surrounding archaeologists.  

The woman continued, &quot;No one that we&#039;ve hired has been successful, and now we cannot even enter the tomb because the undead seem to have taken up residence inside!  If you will clear the tomb and the area leading to it, you can keep whatever equipment you find that was left there by previous adventurers who tried to clear the tomb.&quot;  

Bahati raised her eyebrow and kept eating.  

Bhavya the Acolyte looked up and replied, &quot;We are tired, and our Soldier is still wounded. We do not want to leave our bones and equipment there for the next adventurers you hire.&quot;

Boudica stood up and proclaimed, &quot;It is only a scratch, not even enough to waste a potion on! And you could lay the undead to rest!&quot; Bahati pulled her back down to her seat and put a spoonful of oatmeal in her mouth.

Bhavya looked guilty but turned her attention back to her food.

The spokesperson retreated to hold a murmured discussion with her group, and then approached the heroes again, &quot;My name is Caro, and these are my colleagues, Bartholomew, Wendy, Max, and Vera. We will also add some gold in addition to whatever you find there if you destroy the undead.  But you cannot keep any historical artifacts from the tomb or graveyard, only that which was left by other adventurers. Are you willing?&quot;

Bahati the Archer stood.  &quot;Gold is good.  What say you, friends?&quot;  Nodding, the other two finished their food, then also stood and gathered their gear.
[/i]


[b]Still using the Bones Darkness Deck, I set up a 6x12 combined tile with the To Cut Off the Head Quest and the Consuming Darkness Trap.  I reset the Heroes&#039; Threat, the AP on the Darkness card (because there is a trap), and also set the Treasure limit to 5.[/b]

[ImageID=2877414 large]

Since the Consuming Darkness trap (situated at the opposite side of the combined tiles from the heroes) would add an extra AP to the Darkness Track every Refresh Phase (until deactivated) for every hero within 5 spaces of it, it was important to not have all of my heroes enter the second half of the combined tile (within range of the trap) or the Darkness would activate often.

According the the quest rules, the heroes must make 3 Courage tests while adjacent to the Soulless Captain before the captain can take any damage.  

The Archer, having 5 ammo readied from the previous map tile, used Orion&#039;s Tears to take out 5 Shamblers, although one of them resurrected, while the Soldier used Action and Reaction movement cards to get closer to the invincible Soulless Captain.  During the next Hero Cycle, the Archer played a Find Weakness card to help the Soldier start making successful Courage tests against the Soulless. then helped the Acolyte finish off the Shamblers in the first half of the combined tile, and the Acolyte played a protection card.  Then the Darkness arrived and the Soldier took damage and more Shamblers spawned from the lair.  

After making the final necessary Courage test required by the quest, the party concentrated on bringing down the Soulless (and thereby gaining the quest rewards: Gain 1 Serendipity, remove 1 White token from the Treasure bag, and add On Darkened Heels to the Quest deck.) Then the Soldier moved onto the second half of the combined tile (into the tomb section), the party picked up the treasures (just gold pieces), and the others moved into position just out of range of the trap in order to be able to cast ranged attacks.

Before this game was over, another Soulless Captain (not invincible, though!) appeared from a Darkness event, causing damage and allowing Shambler resurrections, and a few more spawns occurred.  All of the heroes were wounded despite using Interrupt cards, and were having trouble controlling their Threat levels, but the Acolyte managed to heal them back to full health before the end of the game, and the Archer used Fool&#039;s Errand to help keep the Darkness at bay.

When the combined tile was cleared, the heroes gained 7 more gold pieces, several potions, and a couple pieces of equipment, and were able to deal with a Merchant (Alyssa Dulac, the jeweler).

Note:  I am writing the tile icon stuff into the story so it seems that the archaeologists gave them the money and potions from the gold hoard, and that the merchant was encountered in town, later.:


[i]&quot;Here are six pieces of gold,&quot; said Caro the archaeologist, when the heroes returned and then the archaeologists accompanied them back to view the results of their battle.  &quot;I see that you also found some good things that the previous adventurers had left behind!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, with their bodies,&quot; Bahati the Archer mumbled.  

The archaeologist shuffled their feet and looked elsewhere, pretending not to hear the Archer, nor see the battered and bloody condition of some of the equipment.

Caro continued, &quot;If you will give your word to clear the rest of the graveyard, which also has a lot equipment lying around that you may find useful, we will now also give you an extra gold piece and these potions of healing and anti-venom.  Is it a deal?&quot;  

The intrepid trio discussed it and decided that it would likely to be to their benefit to search the graveyard for equipment anyway, so they might as well get paid for it.

&quot;If you feed us first, you have my word,&quot; Boudica the Soldier stated, and took the gold and potions.  &quot;We will go this afternoon, but first we must find a merchant to trade in some of this equipment for other gear which will serve us better, and then join your midday repast.&quot;
[/i]

[b]Current tally:
2 Serendipity &amp; 4 GP; 
Archer: 2 Vitality potions, 1 Anti-Venom Potion, and 1 Crossbow, 1 Quiver, and 1 Helm, Amulet of Courage; 
Soldier: 1 Lucky Potion, 1 Shadow Potion, 1 Major Vitality Potion, 1 Leather Armor, Craftsman Goggles, Mythical Cloak; 
Acolyte: 1 Vitality potion, 1 Anti-Venom Potion, 1 Shadow Potion, 1 Hearthfire Necklace and 1 Circle of Dawn.
Treasure bag contents: 28 White, 15 Green, 1 Blue.
All heroes healthy.  Archer has 3 Ammo readied.

Starting a play through of all the scenarios I have. Which is a lot, including the Nice Cup of Tea scenarios with all current playtest tweaks. 

- [thing=119432][/thing] - Snowdon and Blue Mountain
- [thing=144612][/thing]
- [thing=137917][/thing]
- [thing=182173][/thing]
- A Nice Cup of Tea - 2 scenarios 

I rather wish I had the Necropolis expansion, especially since it&#039;s never going to be reprinted, to bring it up to ten-some scenarios for my 10x10 but oh well. 

First game, [b]Snowdon[/b], with engine 6: 220 points. O_o I picked up a ton of contract cards, which seems to have resulted in a lot of positive points. 

[b]Feb 6[/b] 

Second game: [b]Blue Mountain[/b], with engine 3: a sad 168 points. Not so lucky with the contract cards and goof-ups in prioritization resulted in a poor score. I like that the base box has a very different second scenario where your surveyor movement matters more than just surveyor scoring, and the two-ended track was an interesting turn on things. 

Third game: [b]Brittania Bridge[/b], with engine 1: 164 points. I just don&#039;t score well at this game, which probably signals a need to get more familiar with individual scenarios and deal with better prioritization. Even though this expansion is tiny, the addition of the bridge is somewhat interesting, but mostly it&#039;s a different variant on the first scenario. It&#039;s OK, a nice change-up of things. </body>

	<body>Greetings to everyone - this is my first item on these geeklists.

This game is new to me, but I understand that most will be very familiar with this game, and so none of what I am writing here will be news to anyone.  However, I am determined to explore it at my own pace and discover things myself, rather than read ahead about the scenarios or copy other people&#039;s ideas.

In order to familiarise myself with the gameplay and the cards available in the core set, I have been playing the starter decks 1-handed against the first scenario Passage Through Mirkwood, playing each of them in turn.  It is clear that these decks are very weak on their own, because of their narrow focus.  I managed to eventually get a win with all but the Tactics deck (due to its lack of questing power).  So lots of defeats, but this is a learning exercise.

I imagined that my next step would be to try to construct a 1-handed deck from the core set (I don&#039;t feel that there is any point taking on the harder scenarios 1-handed with the starter decks), but I now intend to first play the starter decks 2-handed to see how the spheres interact with each other.  That is six different pairings, but I am already hooked on this game and think I will be playing it for a long time.</body>

	<body>I know my entries are pretty boring as I keep playing the same games over and over. But Imperial Settlers is so much fun. This time I am pretty sure I played it correctly and scored 57 points. I have played using the solitaire cards and this time the enemy were the romans.

the solo cards don&#039;t add much but force you to consider them. The barbarians with their 3 attacks and the romans with the 3 builds force you to play the game a little bit differently each time.</body>

	<body>So, we have one of my wife&#039;s friends staying for a few days - and she&#039;s, in a previous visit, expressed that people who play solo games must be a little odd. (Note to self: will need some more savlon for this bit lip before the day is out.) However, she apparently really likes games and would like to play a couple this weekend. What&#039;s appealed, based on the box? Mage Knight. 

I don&#039;t think I have quite that much patience. 

My wife has suggested one of her favourites, Letters from Whitechapel, tonight, and I&#039;ll be happily reaching for the kitchen knife, by then. So it should be fairly cathartic.

In the mean time, I&#039;ve been going through the base rules - and living rules - and begun making a few tentative (sub-optimal) moves around the board with this. I&#039;m so excited to have a copy, but it&#039;s apparent that I&#039;m going to need more quiet time (half-term holiday next week!) to process it and do it justice. 

Can&#039;t wait to properly get to grips with this, and it&#039;s nice to see the imprint of this on some of Phil&#039;s later games... Perhaps I might be able to muster a game of Neanderthal later, instead.

	<body>I am starting to hate the brothers. I have also discovered that I had not done a few things correctly (small things like not adding some cards from the first expansion specially the internal cards).

It is really a very good game for solo play. And 3 more games in one night attest it.</body>

	<body>Been on the shelf since Christmas, and entirely brought to my attention by many of the good people here. I&#039;m interested in train games/stocks and shares games (currently have [thing=421][/thing] waiting in the wings) and I&#039;ve heard so many good things about this, in relation to that genre that I felt very lucky to find a copy in a store.

Now, going through the contents and beginning to set-up, I have to wonder if I want to spend quite so much of my rare game time just sitting here applying hundreds of stickers to the chips... and, boy, am I grateful that the Chip Theory boys apply the Hoplomachus stickers so I don&#039;t have to. 

[imageid=2877811large]

Damn it, now I&#039;m thinking I should just break out Hoplo...</body>

	<body>First game of this, after 2h of organising everything, I finally managed to set up the first game. And I really liked how it develops and gains tension.
I chose the Technician as my avatar, as it was the one recommended for the first game as 1 player. And the alien boss appeared one card to the last in the Hive deck, so I had to keep things at bay till the end.

After this game I have a couple of questions about the gameplay. 

1) If I play with one avatar only, I don&#039;t see a way to play the coordinate cards, unless I keep them to the next turn, but I didn&#039;t see anything in the rulebook about this. So i had a problem with the Ash enemy, as it can only be killed while a coordinating, so I just kept it in the complex using other cards, as I couldn&#039;t kill him by myself. Is this how is supposed to be played?

2) In the card, teams of three, it says that I can keep a card from the barracks if it&#039;s a character, but aren&#039;t all the cards from that deck character cards? I&#039;m a bit confused about this.

EDIT:
2nd game
I played again first mission, but this time two handed, with the researcher and the commander randomly chosen. This time was a bit harder as the hive advances at a higher rate compared to one avatar only, but I managed to win. The commander died during the second objective due to a chest burst, but the researcher was clever enough to kill the alien boss at the end, although she was on the brink of death.

next game I&#039;ll go to the second movie, I&#039;m really liking this game :)</body>

	<body>Received my copy from a trade yesterday. I was really lucky. The person I traded with took really good care of the game, had it well, organised, and even through in a DVG counter tray.

I&#039;ve got it set-up on my card table and am slowly parsing the rules. This thing is a bit of a beast on my 34&quot;×34&quot; table! I still want to try the linked campaign rules (with [thing=65564]HLCAO[/thing]) once I&#039;ve got the the hang of this game, but I&#039;m honestly not sure how I&#039;ll be able to fit both games on my table (it&#039; the only place I can leave a game set-up for any length of time).

After reading some forum posts, I&#039;ve decided to go with Iraq: Show Of Force as my first mission. I&#039;ll update this space  as I fumble my way through my first game.


[u][b]Edit 1[/b][/u]
After some deliberation, I decided try one of each aircraft that was available to me. It&#039;s only a 2-day campaign anyways, so I won&#039;t have enough time to regret my choices. :P


[u][b]Edit 2[/b][/u]
[b]Campaign[/b]: Iraq - Show Of Force
[u]Campaign Squad[/u]:
2 × Scouts
1 × F-16 - &quot;Dart&quot; (G), &quot;Mowhawk&quot; (S)
1 × AH-1 - &quot;Freak&quot; (Av), &quot;Gator&quot; (Av)
1 × AH-64A - &quot;Cougar&quot; (Av), &quot;Daddy-O&quot; (Av)
1 × A-10A - &quot;Pirate&quot; (Av), &quot;Viper&quot; (S)
1 × AV-8B - &quot;Divot&quot; (Av), &quot;Genius&quot; (G)

[b]Day 1[/b]
[u]Target[/u]: Forward Base (6C)
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]:
1 × A-10A (2 × AIM-92, 4 × AGM-65, 2 × MK.83)
1 × AH-1 (2 × BGM-71, 2 × LAU-61)
1 × AH-64A (4 × LAU-61)
[u]Summary[/u]: This mission went fantastically smooth, which also means it wasn&#039;t a great learning experience. The target-bound event was MLRS Bombardment, which took out 5 of the 10 targets, including both AAA sites and a building. Hard to screw up the mission after that.

[u]Target[/u]: Convoy (2S)
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]:
1 × AV-8B (1 × AIM-92, 3 × LAU-61, 1 × ECM Pod)
1 × F-16 (2 × LAU-61, 3 × Mk.20, 1 × ECM Pod)
[u]Summary[/u]: This one went okay. Totally forgot to use the MLRS Bombardment in this mission. Still went fairly well. The enemy took a few pot-shots at the F-16, but only ended up doing 1 structural damage. Enemy was totally wiped-out.


[b][u]Edit 3[/u][/b]
[b]Day 2[/b]
[u]Target[/u]: Tank Spearhead (6A)
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]:
1 × A-10A (2 × AGM-65, 4 × AGM-114, 2 × LAU-61, 1 × Fuel Pod)
1 × AH-1 (2 × AGM-114, 2 × LAU-61)
1 × AH-64A (2 × AIM-9, 2 × LAU-61, 1 × Fuel Pod)
1 × AV-8B (4 × AGM-114, 2 × LAU-61, 1 × Fuel Pod)
1 × F-16 (2 × AIM-9, 2 × AGM-65, 1 × Mk.83, 1 × Fuel Pod)
[u]Summary[/u]: All those tanks scared me and I severely overestimated how much firepower I would need to take them out. Turned-out to eb a walk in the park. Still, this short campaign taught me a lot about the game. Now I feel prepared to play a longer campaign.

[u]Campaign Outcome[/u]: 12 VP = Adequate Victory


:thumbsup: I really like the chit-pull mechanism for aircraft receiving enemy damage.
:thumbsup::thumbsup: Feels similar to Hornet Leader, but is different enough that it definitely stands on its own.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Having separate pilot cards from the aircraft cards is neat, but it feels a little over-complicated after playing Hornet Leader.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Each aircraft type feels fairly different form each other, but I wish there were one or two more aircraft types to choose from.</body>

	<body>Played solo blitz conquest. I was a bit too slow and realized after conquering the first city that I had only one night left to find and conquer the second one.

I rushed through one core tile with no city, found the White city on another core tile... and got stopped by a draconum on my last turn :(

	<body>So, this is my guild and you are my peeps. Last night I hosted my second first friday game night in the &quot;War Room&quot; (wife approved recreation room) and the group consists of a co-worker who is also a member of BGG and the guild [user=orion328][/user]. Another co-worker&#039;s husband who has embraced the board games. Came the first night to just see what it was about and returned and stayed a few hours later than the last time. My neighbor is another but was away to a bachelor party so I invited a long time friend and gamer and her boyfriend. [user=mimariff][/user]

We had a lovely evening playing and introducing games. Coloretto, Dominion, Castle Panic, Tokaido and then three had to go as it had made it past midnight. Robert (Orion328) stayed and owns two copies of Gears of War- one in shrink and he decided to keep it in shrink and bought a used copy to play but had nor learned to play yet so we decided to set up and play gears so he could learn.

So this is not a true solo experience but this is the only place I want to share these plays so forgive...

I went through the set up process as we decided to play Emergence. We started off slow as we learned each others style and discussed options as we went. We struggled getting to the last tile as the boomers kept us at bay and then the wretches showed and would roll a stinking omen every time adding another into the emergence. We finally got into position to start tossing bolo&#039;s to close the hole but first throw was a dud. Didn&#039;t even explode... the manufacturer will be hearing from me soon. The second toss at least had one damage- no omens though??? Third toss same, fourth toss same... um this is getting tough. Finally we close the hole and then this happens.

[imageid=2878177 medium]

Damon is bleeding out and Marcus is completely surrounded. What did Marcus do? He ran... past Damon not even stopping to check but ran. Picked up some more grenades. And had one of the best grenade tosses in my history of playing. 7 hits. There were 3 boomers, and 2 drones on the spot and they were annihilated. There was one drone and 2 wretches after that brilliance. Damon was still bleeding out so went and tended to him. However being the good samaritan has its drawbacks as I was attacked and attacked harshly. Bleeding out now. Damon was able to round a corner and draw then away. Took out the drone with a grenade toss. Ammunition was running low. Took a wretch out and then with one card in hand (with a guard) an no ammo the last wretch pounced. Marcus was on the ground... watching though the smoke and blood and sweat stinging his eyes. Damon rounded quickly and played his last card to fire the hammer burst at 2 power. If he didn&#039;t kill this last wretch the wretch would attack and Damon couldn&#039;t take a hit. 

Robert grabbed the dice. I scooted the chair back a bit, bending at the waist to get a closer look. He blew on the dice and rubbed them in his hands. He shook the dice and time started to slow down... I heard the click of the ceiling fan above me, Adele Hello came on again for the 1000th time this evening. He rolled, they bounced around the tray, click clacking and spinning. When the dust settled the wretch was destroyed. Two sets of arms rose to the sky in unison and we breathed a victorious sigh.

Another great romp with this amazing game. Thanks for letting me tell a story of two playing as I taught another fellow solo gamer how to play so he could start playing on his own.</body>

	<body>Reposted from [geeklist=189837][/geeklist]

[u][b]Scenario 1: War Is Upon Us[/b][/u]

[b]Terran Units:[/b] CA [i]Napoleon[/i], CA [i]Zhukov[/i]
[b]Talon Units:[/b] CA [i]Justice[/i], CA [i]Unity[/i]

[b]Result:[/b] Terran Minor Victory

After a few quasi-games sussing out the rules, correcting myself and playing simple 1v1 ship battles, I dove into the first scenario proper - a four ship, no-terrain knife fight between Terran and Talon heavy cruisers. The Terrans struck first, with alpha strikes destroying forward shields on the Talon...ese? Ians? Ites? S? Dunno, I&#039;ll have to settle on something. Anyhoo: crumpled the forward shields, then the more maneuverable Talon cruisers proceeded to pound away with disruptors. The [i]Zhukov [/i]took it in the shorts a bit, and spent a couple of rounds simply trying to keep its port shields away from the enemy.

[center][imageid=2878224medium]
[size=7]From one of the learning runs. The [i]Zhukov [/i]just unloaded a full broadside into the [i]Justice[/i]&#039;s starboard bow.  The Talon cruiser has used one of its available afterburners this scenario, and the Terran cruiser has a charged battery, waiting to give it a free AP on an impulse when it normally wouldn&#039;t get one. Both ships have used an AP to bid for initiative the next impulse. [i]Justice [/i]took a critical hit that&#039;s increasing its turn radius by 1 until it&#039;s repaired. Spoiler alert: it doesn&#039;t get repaired.[/size][/center] 

It was then a cat-and-mouse game of firing, recharging, and maneuvering, with the Terrans concentrating fire and using their more flexible firing arcs; the [i]Justice [/i]took a [b]critical hit to their power relays[/b], which effectively crippled it for almost two rounds, unable to use available power or even change their power curve while the engineers tried to [-]roll a 6[/-] repair the damage. Eventually the [i]Unity [/i]was destroyed, with the resulting explosion damaging the [i]Zhukov[/i]&#039;s power core. The [i]Justice[/i], unable to charge its disruptors in time to level the playing field, succumbed to a full broadside from the [i]Napoleon [/i]and the Terrans came away victorious.

Alright, let&#039;s get one thing out of the way: I&#039;m a Krohn fan, so I&#039;m predisposed to like this game. I&#039;m also an old school [thing=1589][/thing] fan, and I love tactical combat. So it&#039;s already got me wanting to like it. Four things based off impressions of the first scenario:

1) I expected to eschew the dry-erase-writing-on-the-ships method and go with the log sheets, but after two turns I&#039;d decided I would probably never use the log sheets at all. The dry-erase works great, erasing is painless (and clean - use a Q-tip and it&#039;s a snap), and having all the information about each ship right there on the board (including speed, power, charge status of the weaponry, shield and hull damage) is just [i]so[/i] much better than having to refer back to log sheets. The counters are very large, writing is comfortable, and it&#039;s cool to fill in boxes as your weapons charge!

([b]Side Note:[/b] Yes, I&#039;m six years old on the inside.)

([b]Additional Side Note:[/b] I can see possibly using the sheets in very large engagements when playing solo, but even then I&#039;m not sure I would - I really love the fact that I rarely have to take my eyes off the board.)

2) The rules, as you&#039;d expect, are simple, intuitive, and easy to remember. The impulses alone are far easier to implement than I&#039;d expected, having come from a 32- or 8-impulse SFB/FC background. Here&#039;s the short version, and if it sounds confusing, it means [b]I&#039;ve done a worse job than the rulebook[/b], so don&#039;t hold it against the game.

Every turn has 6 impulses, lettered A-F and tracked on a chart. Based on your power curve for the turn, on certain impulses you&#039;ll get to use &quot;available power&quot; (helpfully, and perhaps not coincidentally, abbreviated as AP) to do one action. Sometimes you&#039;ll have to move, too. Sometimes you&#039;ll do both in a single impulse, and sometimes you&#039;ll do nothing. You can always fire, assuming your weapons are charged. Player with initiative&#039;s ships all go, then the other player&#039;s ships go. The actions available to you make sense - charge a weapon, reinforce a shield, power through a turn, bid for initiative - all useful, and easy to implement.

3) There are so many design decisions here that I initially disagreed with upon reading the rules, but now see how much they improve the game (and the genre, frankly). For example, your shields don&#039;t regenerate; when they&#039;re gone, they&#039;re [b]gone[/b]. Every hit on a ship with a downed shield facing damages the hull - there&#039;s no gradual damage to specific systems. Line of sight is a matter of whether or not something is in range and in a firing arc, there&#039;s no center-to-center measurements. There&#039;s no capabilities other than weapons and shields (and the occasional fighter squadron, if you have a carrier or base) - forget about cloaking devices, ECM, tractor beams, or other &quot;goodies&quot;.

And you know what?[b] Good.[/b] I realized that what this does is keep the battle from devolving into a death march of partial hits, regenerating defenses, whittling away meaningless systems and just hoping for a lucky strike because OH MY GOD IT&#039;S BEEN THREE HOURS WILL YOU JUST PLEASE CRIT ME ALREADY?!? The damage mechanic is clean and as you take hull damage your ship&#039;s deterioration is reflected in [b]adjustments to its power curve[/b], with critical hits in subsystem locations occurring at various spots on your hull&#039;s damage track (and reflected simply by modifications to the already-established mechanics). All, of course, again - [b]visible and present right there on the board for all to see and react to[/b]. It. Is. Brilliant.

[center][imageid=2878226medium]
[size=7]Terran fleet ready for action - shields at maximum, phasers and torpedoes fully charged! The power curve is 3-3-2. They&#039;ll be getting 3 AP and have to move 3 hexes over the course of this round, with a turn radius of 2. Need to spend one of those APs this turn charge those batteries, though.[/size][/center]

4) Solo works great. There&#039;s zero hidden information. The fact that the team with initiative does all their stuff first on each impulse means you&#039;re [b]not stuck mind-shifting back and forth[/b] mid-turn between two sides six times a round. And the decision on whether or not to bid for initiative is easily made; if there&#039;s nothing else to do with a ship&#039;s AP that impulse, slap a bid marker on it. Hell, failing that you could flip a coin if you want. There&#039;s no solo AI - and make no mistake, this thing is begging for a Doomsday machine AI at the very least - but the underlying foundation is so, so streamlined that it probably won&#039;t be long before there is. As it is, I&#039;ve no problem at all playing both sides, especially since everything is so tactical in nature.

There&#039;s more to see and do - I&#039;ve yet to even play with terrain, other weaponry (including missiles, fusion cannons, and wave motion guns), bases, fighters, the campaign system, and ships other than heavy cruisers. 

([b]Side Note:[/b] I&#039;m really curious how hairy it gets on the board once missiles get involved and I have to start tracking who fired what at whom, and where.)

But right now I&#039;m in the honeymoon period, and so far Talon is everything I&#039;d hoped it would be.</body>

	<body>As my week got a bit busy I couldn&#039;t get this to the table until today, but I was surprised as it took me around 1h20 to finish, maybe I got lucky, but I&#039;ll put this on the table more often if it&#039;s like this. I really enjoyed the two games I played so far, although I only won the last one.

This time the Acolyte, the Nymph, the Scout and the Crusader were the heroes (randomly) selected to vanquish the evil in the realm.

[imageid=2878298]

Things went quite well, as I didn&#039;t have very difficult blights to start with (last time I didn&#039;t stop having portals and that killed me very early, although it might have been that I didn&#039;t shuffle very good :laugh:). I managed to get a couple of mysteries quite early, and the heroes started looking for the locations of the relics. The heroes managed to solve a couple of quests that helped them in their own personal quest. 

[imageid=2878297]

Finally, once on of the sacred relics was found, they decided to prepare to battle the necromancer itself. They decided to rally up at the swamp. Some bad weather left 3 of the heroes without the grace of the gods, but the nymph managed to cleanse the swamp of skeletons in time for the crusader to defeat the necromancer while defending himself, with the aid of the bottled magic, a gift from the swamp fairies.

[imageid=2878306]

The realm was liberated from the evil once more, but will not remain a safe place for a very long time. The necromancer will raise, and in the near future new heroes will have to defend the realm one more time.


Love this game, is simple to play but not easy to win, definitely a brain burner. The narrative while playing is excellent, the components are just gorgeous and the number of different heroes keeps amazing me, as they play completely different. I&#039;m very glad indeed that I bought this.  </body>

	<body>I was eager to get a game in this morning.  This time of year my downtime is precious and rare.  And so I spent it on Snowdonia: Blaenau Ffestiniog.  This was the first time I&#039;ve tried anything outside of the standard setup.  

This game is fantastic.  

After playing the standard set-up a dozen times or so, I wondered if the &quot;Replayability&quot; of this game would wane. And, I think it did. So I set it aside.  But the minor tweaks in the game; the importance of moving the surveyor, the event cubes effecting both sides of the board, and the bonuses on the stations breathed new life into Snowdonia for me.  

[imageid=2878300 medium]

The weather, drawing of event cubes, and various decks will ensure that this game begs for a new strategy each play while maintaining a familiarity that makes it accessible.  There are plenty of times I am itching for a new challenge but don&#039;t have the energy for a new game.  This, certainly, fills that desire. 

My only complaint about Snowdonia is setting up the rubble cubes.  But it&#039;s not enough of a complaint to keep me from playing or recommending this to anyone.  Really, it&#039;s not like setting up Caverna. 

*edit* I forgot to post my score.  It was 172.  I&#039;m not sure if the scoring goals are the same for each version of the game.  But it seemed decent to me for a first go around with plenty of room for improvement. </body>

	<body>2nd play and felt pretty good. Scored a -6 which equates to a strategic stalemate. This game is easy to keep setup and play. This is also a second play for [geeklist=202700][/geeklist]. Gonna get one more play in while I have it setup. I may do a video play through for my youtube channel. Lost on the Sinai front

3rd play went even worse. Scored a -29 Strategic defeat and lost to Gallipoli Front.</body>

	<body>I luckily won my copy of Star Realms in lottery in December.
First two plays today against Nemesis Beast.
It kicked my bottoms badly, with 22 resp. 21 authority remaining.

I&#039;m really not good in seeing the possible combos, not just in this game, that is pretty usual with me (looking at you, Imperial Settlers).

I will go against the Pirates next time.

	<body>Got my run in for Mud Challenge 15 today. This was only my 2nd play of this game.

Rough race! Looks my dice rolling luck from last month&#039;s ISGOYTRA is still in force......Unfortunately.

Rolled 4 :!block: on first turn - used Sisu (felt like I had to use it, after rolling 7 dice and getting into 5th gear).
Got flat tire on 1st shortcut (4th turn of game); used spare tire 2 turns later, since this happened so early in the race.
In last quarter of race, rolled 3 :!block: on 4 dice - luckily was only in 3rd gear and spun off into the grass avoiding body damage on the car.

Still had fun running this race and I&#039;m looking forward to seeing the results.


:thumbsup:The Dirt Expansion really adds in some new challenges and decisions giving more options to make throughout the race.
:thumbsdown:These dice are not showing the love right now.......

	<body>Late to the party I know (fashionably late?  :cool:).  My very first play of [thing=96848][/thing]!  I had to see what all the fuss was about.

I played the introductory game, First Reconnaissance, with Norowas (with Tovak as the Dummy).  I scored a 70, finding the city during the second day round.  I don&#039;t have much to add so far.  I think I&#039;ve played the rules correctly (what a great manual!) and am starting to get a feel for the flow of the game.  I am now looking forward to my first solo conquest!</body>

	<body>The buildings were ablaze tonight. There were some really tense dice rolls as the smoke was chaining through the building, and the hot spots just wouldn&#039;t quit in the first game, causing the sections to catch fire again. The first 4 alarm fire ended with a building collapse after 5 of the people had been rescued.

The second building went much better as I switched out the Generalist for CAGS and was able to keep the fire under control in the building, despite his limited movement.

	<body>Double play of Thief Solo

The first game was a close one, with the collapse due to happen at the end of the turn when I stashed the sixth treasure.

The second seemed like it was going to be close for a while, but then this happened:
[imageid=2877578 medium]

That lucky throw of the Flare opened up three vaults all within 4 steps of the exit, which made cleaning them out super easy.   The collapse had not yet started when I stashed the last treasure (plus one extra), but as it turned out that would have taken several turns because most of the crystals that had not yet been uncovered were buried near the center, so it would have take at least two or three full turns before it would have ended.</body>

	<body>I played a quick scenario &quot;Get to the Choppa!&quot; which is in the ZMergency expansion.  The scenario seems simple enough - explore the tiles and get to the choppa before you lose your braiiiinnnsss.  

Well, it started off badly, having my team members armed with a knife, baton, AK-47 with limited ammo, and a Beer Keg.  Heading out of the reception my team was staring out the window when a falling flaming zombie (apparently from my earlier game of Flash Point) broke through the glass ceiling and landed on my team, doing a whopping 10 points of damage - it was clear that this was not going to be easy.  They went into the operating room and found 6 Zeds, plus a person that was being stood over by some doctors that apparently turned right before a routine operation. They were able to be saved and were added to the team, but they didn&#039;t know how to fight, and she only could use her stiletto heels to kill a zed.

Things kept getting worse as the contamination spread around us.  Firing off rounds from the AK-47, the unskilled person was merely putting bullets in the rounds, and just when they got used to the kickback of the gun... click.  They were out.

The Beer Key gave some liquid courage to take down a few more zeds, but a few more encounter cards later and horrible dice rolls led to a very quick death of my red team, and the blue team fell shortly thereafter.

I really like this game - it&#039;s dark, has some humor, and is relentless.  It&#039;s the closest feeling I have to the Walking Dead in a board game.  The player aids on BGG are a must to help out with issues on the rulebook, but once you get through the rules, it&#039;s a really fun game, with a lot of different scenarios in the box - and it&#039;s much cheaper than many other games in the genre.  Definitely worth a look if you&#039;re into thematic dice games. </body>

	<body>Had another go at Nations, playing China with its Dynasty cards. With the extra worker China can be quite interesting, but that advantage was hindered early on with my weak stone engine, especially since I purchased Silk Road and then had a lack of good stone producing cards. Silk road is one of the new progress cards from the expansion - Really good returns coupled with a penalty and a restriction of max x workers on the card. In this case +5 gold, -1 stone, max 1 worker and 3VP for 2 stone placement. More useful to other nations (due to the worker restriction), but still a really nice building, and one I kept till the end of the game. Almost a must buy I&#039;d hazard to say. I also acquired Archimedes (+1 stone, 1 private architect) early and put him to good use, but when I got his upgraded version (Marie Curie - +4 stone, 2 private architects) and Sistine Chapel (+3 books when architect hired) out, the wonders stopped coming or were wiped off by the AI, leaving only a natural wonder. Ah well, such is the nature of the game. Would be less of an issue against opponents, but it is part of the nature of the solo game. Also got a dynasty card into play this time too - Yay for high stability.

[imageid=2878936 medium]

I did get my best score yet on Prince difficulty, a tidy 52. Haven&#039;t dared increase it yet, but we shall see :) 

:thumbsup: Some very interesting cards added, and the natural wonders do require some thought before taking. They may be &#039;free&#039;, stone wise, but they do consume turns.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: The AI can be great at ruining your plans ^^</body>

	<body>Played a solo game using Sharon Hunter.  She had an ally named Reggie for this game.  The Nazis were the villains, with a secret base in the Alps.

[size=18][b]Sharon Hunter and the Valley of the Pale Moon[/b][/size]
[size=10]Sharon Hunter traveled from New York City to South Africa to seek the Valley of the Pale Moon and the temple therein.  She had to dive underwater to find her first clue, then had to sneak past Tresa.  She then made it past a hidden trap in the temple (which had become unstable by this point).  Tresa was around, so Sharon had to sneak around her again, and got caught up in a car chase outside the temple.  This caught Tresa&#039;s attention, but Sharon was able to sneak past her again and re-enter the temple.  She felt she was not alone, and the temple became even more unstable.  The Nazis brought in airplanes, and Sharon engaged in an airplane chase, but when it was over, Tresa found her and nearly killed her (Sharon took six wounds, but took out Tresa&#039;s henchmen).  Sharon crossed a perilous bridge and the unstable temple held as Sharon escaped with the treasure.

Herr Taufel deployed to the Ivory Coast.  The Nazis used vile tactics and blitzed Russia and the American Bayou.  The War Zeppelin tried to reach the Andes, but only made it to the Caribbean. Sharon went to Cape Town to recover.  She bought a tommy gun and some adventure boots, and also found the secret of success when she attended a positive thinking seminar.

Meanwhile, Herr Teufel was well on his way to gaining the Spear of the Dead, taking a wound, but passing two of the dangers.  The War Zeppelin traveled to the Devil&#039;s Reach and dropped off a Nazi.  The villains achieved Dark Power.[/size]

[size=18][b]Sharon Hunter and the Spear of the Dead[/b][/size]
Sharon Hunter and Reggie traveled to the Ivory Coast and had a nightclub rendezvous that threatened to defeat her.  Luckily, her secret of success paid off.  She was able to sneak past Herr Teufel, then infiltrated a secret Nazi base.  Now she had to fight Teufel, but she wounded him and killed his henchmen with her tommy gun, taking some serious wounds herself in the process.   She then had a late night encounter and gained the artifact!

Tresa deployed to find the Heart of the Damned in Antartica.  The War Zeppelin was ordered to Arabia but only made it to the Congo.  A Nazi appeared in the Indonesian Jungle.

[size=18][b]Sharon Hunter and the [COLOR=#FF0000]Heart[/COLOR] of the Damned[/b][/size]
In Antartica, Sharon and Reggie visited a shady warehouse, and then fought Tresa, taking more wounds, but killing Tresa&#039;s henchmen.  They infiltrated a secret ritual to learn more about the Heart of the Damned, and then had to sneak past Tresa again.  This was followed by a harrowing boat chase among the ice flows along the coast of Antartica, but she found the Heart of the Damned!

Herr Teufel deployed to Manchuria while the Nazi&#039;s occupied Venice.  The War Zeppelin traveled to the Amazon Jungle to drop off a Nazi.  

Sharon Hunter and Reggie returned to Cape Town and sold her artifacts, earning 15 fortune and won the game.</body>

DANG! This game is tough.

Tried the [b]Journey down the Anduin[/b] with my Lore/Tactics deck. I am sure that deck is good for something...right? Right?

Bloody no good for this mission. Took care of the Troll, but the locations once again became a nightmare. (I&#039;m playing on Easy.) :p

The worst part was one card did 1 Damage Vs every character questing. Which was 5 outta 6 characters I had. And 3 of those fools only had 1 hit point. Soooooo, I lost pretty much everyone, and there was no recovery.

That spelled the end with the 2 locations that [b]forced you to visit them first[/b], and 1 Location with 5 threat, that I couldn&#039;t even visit.

[IMG]https://postmediaprovince.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/murphy_v2_threats2cops.jpg[/IMG]

Back to the drawing board.

I&#039;m going to mix together the core cards:

[user=suzyvitale]

kindly sent me, as the part of the prize for last month&#039;s SGOYT Giveaway. With more handy cards, I might be able to put something together. I beat this scenario before, and I remember it being tough. But dang, even with the super hard cards removed, this game is rough.

	<body>Mission 2 (of a 35 mission tour of duty):

Captain Arte Novak and the crew of &quot;Flak Happy&quot; had an uneventful take-off, en route to Akashi to bomb an aircraft factory. Things progressed without incident to the formation point. The squadron formed up successfully.

Intelligence had warned the pilots that fighter resistance was expected to be heavy, but nothing prepared the crew for what happened over Iwo Jima. Four Toryus approached, two from 12 o&#039;clock, one at 10:30 and an ace at 1:30.

[imageid=2879024 large]

The crew shot down one plane and damaged two more. The remaining enemy fighters were unable to score a hit on the bomber.

Other than a single Zero that the crew shot down over the target zone, the rest of the journey to the target was uneventful. The crew dropped their bombs, but were off target.

Other than a little difficulty finding the approach, the return to base passed quickly and easily and ended in a safe landing.</body>

	<body>(Apologies if there is a half post of this that appears - I clicked on the mouse errantly and everything reset).

I followed garyrbrooks&#039; suggestion and posted the base game Fleet solo variant I mentioned the other day (uses only the licenses from the base game, and gives the captains access to extra licenses and boat launches). I had a bad go at it the last couple of days, but turned it around today. I need to learn how to adapt to a poor series of licenses to win under the alternative rules; the captains will get their points, regardless, so I need to manufacture them somehow when my preferred strategy won&#039;t fly.

Tonight, a fun example of when it goes according to plan:

[b]I.S. Crab and Lobster: 95
T.C.: 74
Kirkman: 40[/b]

It was a nine-round game that ended when the fish supply was exhausted. I grabbed early tuna and lobster licenses, got a cheap cod license when the other captains&#039; bids missed, and was able to generate enough cash flow to pick off the premium licenses as they came up (finished with two king crab and a Fisherman&#039;s Pub, while the remaining premium was still in the deck at game&#039;s end).

I filled 29 crates, and had 9 captains for bonus points (plus the five-license king crab bonus). T.C. managed 9 boats and 7 licenses, but between a couple of missed launches and the lack of premium licenses, couldn&#039;t hold onto his early lead.

Drinks are on me at the Wharfside Casino! 

[ETA: To give a quick glimpse of what it looks like when it doesn&#039;t go according to plan, T.C. smoked me for [b]110(!)[/b] earlier.]</body>

	<body>This is the second of five plays with each of the Nations on their B-sides to take advantage of the special abilities. The expansions will not be used.  I am comparing plays with each B-side player board to my original ten plays with the generic A-side.  Following are synopsis posts of the previous games:

[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/202271/item/4408141#item4408141]Ten Completed (final game)[/url]
[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/204546/item/4434293#item4434293]China[/url]
 
In multiplayer games my group has found Egypt to be extremely powerful.  Egypt has the extra Pyramid buying power to go for more expensive cards on the Progress Board.  In addition, Egypt has the added flexibility to purchase and develop Wonders during turns with sparse building offers due to the private Architect.  It was fun and different playing Egypt in the solo game but the experience did not stand out like China as much as it felt like an alternate to the generic side with no major advantage.  Of note, if you go to post 158 in this thread you will see mogust had almost the same score as mine with China.

The final layout includes coins on the upper right Wonder development box representing the final book score.  Also notice that I had really good Wonders but the Building development is less impressive.

[imageid=2879094]

I am looking forward to the next three plays with the other B-sides before I integrate the expansion.  I may need to even delay that if I feel random in-game occurrences warrant a circle around for an additional plays.

Nation: Egypt (B-Side: Brevery, Pyramids, 1 Private Architect)
Level: Prince

Game VP: 19
Colonies: 0
Wonders: 8
Buildings: 15

7 Gold
2 Wheat
14 Stone
45 Book
68 Resource Total: 6

Final Score: 48 - Victoria

	<body>So I have played the [filepage=119415]3 years in the village[/filepage] solo variant several times and really enjoyed it. 

I really wanted to try it with Village Inn, however, so I did that today. 

I tried to create rules for the Tavern that matched the original solo variant. I decided on using a die role the following way:
Tavern: role a die to determine which card stack moves a card to the bottom, then roll the die to determine which card the AI takes. 1-2 is stack  1, 3-4 is stack 2,and 5-6 is stack 3. Any end game scoring cards will score maximum points. 

Having set the rules this way, I played on the &quot;hard&quot; difficulty, but forgot to only play 3 rounds. I probably played 4-5 rounds, but in the end I lost 83-69. 

I felt like I really tried hard to deny the AI any cards, which I succeeded at; he had zero cards. It seemed good; I would definitely play it this way again. 

Has anyone else tried this before? How about with Village Port? 

Note: also posted in Village forums. 

[b]Update[/b]: I tried this again with the same rules for Village Inn and the Port rules suggested by [user=ian_07720169619][/user]
I used the simple suggestion, giving one vp for travel.  I also wanted to try the life goals, so I dealt the AI and myself one of each, not sure how to score the AIs at end game (automatically score both? Score half the combined total?).

I played only three rounds this time and the final score was 58-46 in favor of the AI.  I didn&#039;t give him any points for the life goals because he trounced me as it was.  I think it worked well, but I want to try it out some more and see if there are any tweaks I want to make.  </body>

	<body>Had this one set up on the table and played two games of this. I was doing chores around the house and would come back to it, play a few turns and get back to doing chores. Not the most efficient way to do any of this, but still... I got things done and managed to sneak in a fun game.

First time I included the [thing=183091][/thing]. I randomly drew one skill for my dwarf and got [i]Soul Gem: You may spend one VP in lieu of any one gem[/i].

At first I thought, that made the game really really easy. Then I realised I had spent way too much VP on this and didn&#039;t get enough in return. I should have payed more attention, too, because at one point I ended up too far away from anything and it took me two complete turns to be able to discover a new room tile.

[imageid=2879256large]

I scored 44 points. Only one more and I would have been promoted to Journeyman. I guess that just means, I&#039;ll have to try again tonight...


:thumbsup: Fun family game! One of my favourites.
:thumbsdown: Pretty light game, don&#039;t expect too much of a brainburner.
:thumbsdown: Having said that, I feel even more dumb than usual, since I didn&#039;t get a good score. Again...

	<body>Broke out one of my favorites this morning! We&#039;re at my parent&#039;s and I brought mostly gateways, but made sure that some can be solo&#039;d! 

I drew Bone Island for my Island set up (cards [listitem=1553685]here[/listitem]). And played with the Pilot and the Engineer on normal difficulty.

I had my little &quot;helper&quot; but he got tired midway through and went to play with his cute little 18 month old cousin. Which makes me sound like a heartless clod, but I did play with her too! 

The &quot;dumbbell&quot; appearance to Bone Island made it so that all the treasures were on one side of the island. We pretty much stayed there and gathered treasures. The Flood level was up to 5, but I managed a win on what was probably the last or second to last turn. Any more turns and I think I would have lost. There were only 5 tiles left and most of them were submerged. 

I have these guys too:

The first one went really good, I won in round 10 with 30 authority remaining.
Well, that was easy, I had thought, let&#039;s beat them for the second time and then back to Nemesis Beast. I couldn&#039;t be more wrong.

I lost in sixth round, rounds 5 and 6 being lethal, with 24 and 16 authority loss.

	<body>Nothing like a little English Civil War on an Friday night. I was able to play through the entire first war and well... The Royalists are closing in on little ole London. I had fought them quite well but a major defeat late in the deck along with losing Bristol and Hull put me on the defensive. 

I used the log sheet created by a BBG member to mark down my status so I can pick up my campaign later with the second civil war. Oh, did I mention I didn&#039;t gain a single achievement? 

:thumbsup: as a history teacher this S.O.S game is right in my wheelhouse. 

:thumbsup: tough decisions to make with the limited zeal.

:thumbsdown: uh, I felt less tension in comparison to a game such as Dawn of the Zeds but it&#039;s only my first game and likely an unfair comparison.

:thumbsup: enjoyed the tactical battles and while they often are draws the loss of a zeal does hurt and if you lose at the wrong time it can really pressure you in a track.</body>

	<body>My first run of this one, just to get the gist of it, so it&#039;s going to be a short post. 

First of all, this game is a beauty. Big props to Ian O&#039;Toole for his art and graphic design. It is trully a game that I want to experience just for its looks. And I buy, play and keep games based only on the mechanics, but I recognize that playing is also an aesthetic experience. And this one is a very pleasant one, I must say.

On the same line, the more I play and the more games I try, I&#039;m realizing that I&#039;m a euro gamer, I couldn&#039;t care less about the theme or about the story the game is trying to tell (to read stories I just read books). That said, I really appreciate that Vital Lacerda made a game with a mature and original theme. 

So you won&#039;t be surprised if I don&#039;t elaborate much about your role in this game as a gallerist buying art, discovering artists, promoting them, atracting clients, celebrities and investors and eventually selling art to gain influence and money. If you&#039;re like me, this is what matters: this is an economic game. Buy cheap and sell dear, and manipulate the market to do so.

Although, it&#039;s not that simple. Lacerda mixes a lot of mechanics and his game has various &quot;mini-games&quot; that require a lot of thinking: worker placement, area influence (in the international market), set collection, commodity speculation. And I think they all blend together very elegantly.

[imageid=2879493 medium]

But how&#039;s the solo mode? It&#039;s very good. You&#039;r playing &quot;against&quot; a dummy gallerist, Lacerda, that goes around the board blocking spaces and leaving assistants. But like the multiplayer game, the spaces aren&#039;t really blcoked, you can always take that space and kick out other player&#039;s pawn or assistant. In the solo mode, that will speed up the timer. That&#039;s essentially what the dummy player is: a smart timer that also constraints your options in the international market, limiting your final scoring too. 

I will need to play this more to have a more informed opinion, so I&#039;m not going to give thumbs up and down. What I can say is that I loved it.</body>

	<body>First of all a massive thank you to [user=Estolan][/user]

She sent me her copy as an act of total generosity. You are one top lady.

Played it 4 times this weekend after I finally worked out the rules. The rulebook is fine but I just couldn&#039;t get my head round it. Luckily there was a decent playthrough video and that clicked my brain in to gear.

My 4 results:

1. Lost. My forces were scattered on the final turn.

2. Lost. My forces were scattered about halfway through the mission deck. Had a really bad hand draw on the first turn and never recovered.

3. Won. 4.5 VPs. Bronze Star. Managed my deck and the axis cards well and built up to a few good scoring turns at the end.

4. Won. -9 VPs. Campaign Ribbon. About 2/3 of the way through it became clear that my hand had too many disorganised cards in it and I was going to be lucky to survive through the mission deck, let alone score any points. That was the case.

I&#039;m not sure about this game. I survived the mission deck in 2 of the games and nearly in another so getting a &#039;win&#039; doesn&#039;t seem too hard but getting a decent score seems like it will be.

I&#039;m not sure if surviving and scoring -9 feels like a win to me (even the 4.5 didn&#039;t feel that great). The score might not be so bad if I had to capture at least 1 objective or defeat an axis card (I achieved neither on my 4th game) to do it.

Time will tell with this one.

:thumbsup: A deck builder (I enjoy the mechanics) that is tough enough to give some of the feeling of its theme.

:thumbsdown: Winning didn&#039;t really feel like winning. More like a draw.</body>

	<body>Another evening of Shadowrun. I picked 4 runners again. I never liked playing more than one character but here, things are different. I really enjoy it!

First Mission, first round in progress:

[ImageID=2879549 large]

First round went ok. I was lucky to get some very cool cards from the black market and save some Nuyen for a 9 Nuyen card which I bought in round 2.

Anyway, my runners were beaten at the end of round 1:

[ImageID=2879555 large]

Round 2 and I pulled some tough obstacles. I managed to fight off 2 from the 5 obstacles facing my runners when the first one went critical:

[ImageID=2879558 large]

The Decker again... like last time. The first one to be critical, was the Decker.
Mission was aborter but I managed to get out alive. 1 Karma for each of them. Ready for a new run.

I really enjoy this game! [size=7]I already ordered [thing=168888][/thing] and the [thing=180049][/thing].[/size]

I think my runners are ready for another run. Table is still set up. Let&#039;s get it on!

Edit: another run. Made it to the 3rd obstacle and all runners went down. :zombie:</body>

	<body>Finally managed to find the time for an epic solo game. 5h of gameplay. Is true that it was my second game and my first ever solo epic, so I had to look over the rules quite a few times, mostly for the mining action, so in the next games it will probably go down. With the standard game I felt it was an ok game, but eight he epic game the game shines like a diamond. I had doubts about it, but I glad I gave it another opportunity. I know it won&#039;t get to the table that much, but I think is different enough to other games in my collection to have its own place. I need to test the standard game for only the second stage, as it might be more interesting than playing only through the first stage and you can play it in around an hour.

The game starts:
[imageid=2879567]

Things are going ok at the end of the first round, now going into the unknown.
[imageid=2879568]

After some struggles in the 2nd and 3rd stage, and having to stop a couple of times to think thoroughly what to do to not loose in a couple of rounds I managed to get to the end with a perfect timing to end all the quests and claim victory.
[imageid=2879571]

With a total of 466 points, not too close to the 600 in the rulebook, but happy to avoid loosing, as is very easy to run out of materials or people once the quests start getting serious. That multi-headed hydra almost made me loose the game :laugh:

[imageid=2879573]

:thumbsup: Different kind of eurogame/fantasy game.
:thumbsup: The tension keeps rising as you advance and it gets more difficult to continue
:thumbsdown: A bit too long for the awesome epic game 
:thumbsdown: For such a long game it might be too punishing to loose by failing one quest as is mandatory to get a new quest every turn. Is very difficult to gain that many materials and money to keep going every turn. I know is part of the upkeeping and is in part what keeps the tension so high, but I also know that I got lucky in couple of tough situations this game, as probably a different card in the market or in the quests at that moment probably meant defeat.</body>

	<body>Decided to switch up my starting team and reattempt High Impact VIP Sit-Down again. 

This time I took two player soldiers (Hart &amp; Thomas) to ensure I could bring more action cards to play. I had a hard time getting location cards last time. Hart was nice for his two extra mission turns, especially since I had an event last time that caused me to lose two. This was me hedging my bets against that. I also had Samaniego (NPS) for his medical ability (his free weapon and first aid kit are nice bonuses as well). Finally, Rowe (Squad) filled out my team. 

So, I had less gear but in trade ended up with more turns, more available action cards and an additional two actions each turn. 

[floatleft][img]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CanteoEUEAA4rUE.jpg:large[/img][/floatleft]

With the extra time I took it slow and steady. Having two hands of action cards let me find locations quickly, and have more choices as to which ones I used. It took 13 turns, but we managed to destroy the house where the VIPs were meeting ... with our last grenade. Also, we didn&#039;t take a single hit. 

Only minimal mistakes were made. I think I played one turn using Rowe&#039;s 0 range stats when he was attacking one card away.

Multiple player soldiers certainly made this an easier mission. The two extra actions each turn certainly didn&#039;t hurt either.</body>

	<body>After a few rounds of Nightfighter with the excellent Philip Sabin solo rules I was inspired to open up its sister game, the lower then low suitable for Solo gaming [thing=27101][/thing]

[img]http://www.gmtgames.com/images/gmtzs619.gif[/img]
Actual GMT rating :)

I just set it up and began what I can only call &quot;make up a solo variant while playing the game&quot;. To my amazement it kind of worked. I put 6 different colored counters in the bomber start-up hexes (Agricola fences are really useful as you can see). Made up some rules about when and where to move the raids after a die roll and started the game. Direction of the raids was random and could change on every turn so the Nightfighter squadrons had to gues what the best move would be. Every time a raid was intercepted (Himmelbrett CGI rol but on a successful Tame Boar infiltration I would have done the same) I checked if the raid was a dummy raid. If the raid was real I checked if it was the main raid or a Mosquito raid). After detection or on passing the Himmelbrett line I hand picked a target for the raids based on the targets near them at that time. Card play was as in the normal game using best judgement and playing out cards even when I knew they could be (would be) countered. The result was an unexpected amazing experience.

[imageid=2879589 large]

Mannheim-Ludwigshafen was leveled to the ground in an almost perfect devastating bombardment. Enraged fighter pilots of I NJG4 that had infiltrated the bomber stream took revenge and downed 10 bombers. The end score was a Draw (British 34 VP, Germans 20 VP). The German score was boosted when I kept rolling :bd6-1: on the Mosquito kill confirm checks.

While my resulting game uses the Bomber Command pieces and part of the mechanics the game itself is fundamently changed and becomes more like a puzzle / optimalisation exercise. It did tell a great story. I&#039;m going to clean up the rules and have another go at it soon. </body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been excited to check this one out since I first heard about it. I really enjoyed Qwixx as a light family game, and this one looked like it was in the same vein. The coolest thing about the game is that everyone gets to do everything on every turn--in fact, your turn is only distinguished from anyone else&#039;s by the fact that you&#039;re the one rolling dice. There are no rules changes for the solo game, you just try to score as well as you can.

Overall, I didn&#039;t find it very satisfying to play solo. In a multiplayer game, how well you scored compared to your opponents provides a metric of how well you planned ahead and dealt with the same circumstances as everyone else at the table. Even if I were to have a particularly great score in a solo game, it would feel hollow, because I wouldn&#039;t know if someone else would have been able to play more efficiently given the same set of rolls. 

I do think we could organize a fun 1-Player Guild solo challenge for this game. We could put a series of dice rolls in spoiler tags, and everyone could upload their scoring charts to see how their scores compared.

	<body>I&#039;m a little annoyed with myself for not picking this one up earlier. I&#039;ve been having a blast playing solo and multiplayer. The basic solo game feels like a beat-your-own-score deal, but it&#039;s so much fun to build your empire and pull off crazy combos that I don&#039;t mind. I haven&#039;t even started the campaign variant yet, as I&#039;m really enjoying learning the ins and outs of each faction. I scored 102 points with the Romans during my most recent solo game, a new high score. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on both the Romans and Barbarians, but I still have a lot to learn. The learning curve on this game really contributes to replayability, and I&#039;m super impressed with how well the game has been holding my attention.

	<body>Four plays today. Scoring from 55 to 90, yep scoring in this game is strongly lucky based. Official solo mode isn&#039;t a brilliant design, max positive what I can say about this mode - it works, but you won&#039;t find much fun here. 

Additionally without master builder you must face with lack of money. You can aim on gardens or you will lost few rounds for taking money. :shake:

Last 2 games I played with few minor changes which gives player some money and mechanism to control luck in draft:
1) setup - draw 4 scoring cards, take 2 discard others
2) at start of each round - draw 3 cards for spots (2000/4000/6000),  you can reaarange them (before revealing tiles), for doing that you must pay 1000. If you don&#039;t want rearange cards you will receive 1000 from bank.
3) when taking 5000 or buying corridor or stairs - chose one tile on the market, you won&#039;t discard it, instead place it on 2000 spot for next round. 

With this changes game is more playing friendly, but probably easier so ranks should be changed ;)</body>

	<body>I really enjoyed playing the solo campaign, but felt a little burnt out after it, having played 12 games in quick succession. Now that I&#039;ve had a break from it, it was time to get it back to the table again.

Atlanteans was the faction of choice for this game, and I really like that they have much more of a focus on common buildings than other factions. In many sessions, particularly solo, commons are mostly just placed down for immediate use as foundations or razed as resources, while the Atlanteans [u]need[/u] to utilize and keep them in order to generate their points and have a chance of winning. It&#039;s a refreshing change, and there are some really nice common buildings (though many are just copies/variants of faction buildings). They are also the only faction that gets to use defence tokens in solo mode, which they need to, otherwise the AI will destroy all of their hard work.

This session went pretty well - plenty of card draw, cog generation and conversion. First turn was a bit slow, but once the first few buildings were down everything fell into place. It&#039;s also good to go back to doing full 5 rounds (from having done 4 for the campaign), and the game finished with a score of 103, which I was very happy with.

[imageid=2879709 medium]
[imageid=2879724 medium]

:thumbsup: The Atlanteans also have some very nice and interesting buildings and new mechanics.
:thumbsup: The artwork is as awesome as ever.
:thumbsdown: This expansion seems to cause the most rules mistakes and confusion thus far.
:thumbsdown: The Atlanteans have no raze capability, which you will have to luck into from the common deck

	<body>I managed to play a couple of games against the twins but I keep losing, normally for just a card or two. The pivotal event normally killed me.

I decided to quit banging my head on the wall and try 3 games against Lt. Jackson until I finally beat him.

Over to the 4th pack. And that was different, very very different. What a horrible defeat!

I am enjoying this game more and more as much as I play it.</body>

	<body>I have decided to try something different, going through the games I have available within easy reach I found this C3i game. After looking at the map and seeing the size I thought it would be wonderful for solo play and for my space. I have heard a lot of good things about the big game, so I am happy to try this one out.

Technically I am cheating because it is already set up but I need to read the rules first!

[b]First Update[/b]

I have deleted the double entry.

Yesterday I had my first go at the game after delaying the start due to having to spend the previous evening at the hospital with my baby girl (nothing other than fever but being almost 5 months old we had to take her).

The game goes smoothly which I thought it would do due to all the DRM you need to check, but after a couple of times checking they become second nature (not very complicated).

I have only gone through the first turn but the Germans destroyed 3 units and created a massive gap in the center. The south resisted pretty well and in the north the trap unit managed to escape.

[ImageID=2883654]

[b]Second Update[/b]

This is going to be a loooong game. Not because of the game but due to my personal live, makes it difficult to dedicate more than 20 minutes burst maximum. Still I don&#039;t see that as an issue with this game.

I have gone through the second turn (picture coming). Again the German steamroller had a very good turn, so good in fact that the Russians did nothing on their turn which might not be bad. The 4th panzer army used the gap in the middle to try to surround the defenses near Rostov and overrun the planes there. The problem with that approach is that a lot of pressure had to be exerted in the north to open a corridor and avoid leaving the 4th panzer OOS.

Come the end of the turn the Russians simply bought all of the killed units from the first turn (3 inf) the second plane and upgraded one unit, they also recovered 2 sorties. This means that for turn three the Russians are enjoying a complete air superiority (2 air units at 4 sorties against one at 6) and they are starting to look receive enough reinforcements to prepare for a good defense.

[ImageID=2884940]

[b]Third update[/b]

[ImageID=2886750]

[ImageID=2886751]

Two turns played yesterday and a harsh realization. I had made a stupid strategic mistake. I had pushed through the north of the map without realising that, considering the supply rules, that is a dead end for the germans. So they had to do (see pictures above) a considerable turn on their operating center, and they only managed to do that on the turn were severe weather started.

This has given the USSR the opportunity of gaining some time to the much needed rebuild and to start to prepare for a fightback.

Another strategic blunder has been not going strong on Rostov. It is a factory which means a 2 point extra production per turn for the Russians...

Lets see how it all ends up, but if I had to bet, I would not bet on the Germans</body>

	<body>After trading for this one last month, I finally got it to the table: Once late last night, and once after lunch today. I am not sure what I think about it. I love the setting and the mechanics, but I think it might be early days in deciding if I like it or not.

Last night I finished with $118, a minor defeat. Today I finished with $213, a major victory. However, to get that score, I had to be a bit of a scumbag: Holding off paying people until the bitter end, using talent to get money, then not paying them when we did not make enough to pay their salaries (even though they&#039;d worked in a previous show), and lowering the rep of the company to get places and put on shows to make money to pay them. Maybe that&#039;s showbiz, but it felt a little too slimey for me. :(

Oh! And I noticed that most of my points / sales came from the end of the season (August / September). Up until those months, the circus was really just struggling to hold on.

I will have play a few more times to see what I think of the game...</body>

	<body>So I received this game a while back from the always delightful [user=suzyvitale][/user] 

I had a great deal of difficulty getting through the rules book as I usually do with most games, hence the huge delay getting this to the table. I printed a couple player aid files and watched quite a few vids on game play. I finally said, &quot;Screw it&quot; and just took it out and went for it. 

[ImageID=2879833large]

It was much easier to play than the rule book made me think. The player aids helped a bit. The turns we much quicker than I expected, which is nice. I had a bit of confusion on some of the actions, but I&#039;m pretty sure I got them correct. Wasn&#039;t that difficult to come to a conclusion I felt was the right way. After the 5th iMPi chit pull, I had lost. I had used my actions to: 
1) play a hero
2) replenish ammo/water
3) start barricade 1/3
4) volley - which killed 1

So I don&#039;t think I played terribly. I shot once I had a zulu in range and with 4 dice, but that same unit then advanced 2 more for the win. I think I just had bad chit pulls. Weird thing is, 2 of my 5 chits were the R (rest) chit, so nothing happened.

[ImageID=2879835large]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided that I had to give it another go, seeing as I took longer to set the game up than it did to play and lose. This one went the same way and it was over by the 4th iMPi chit pull! And again, 1 of those chits was a R chit. The others were 1 zulu moved 1, all zulus moved 2 and then the another zulu unit moved 3,... and that was game.

Brutal.

:thumbsup: Decent enough components.

:thumbsup: Easy set up, not a huge foot print.

:thumbsup: Fairly quick game play.

:thumbsdown: Rule book.

:thumbsdown: The fact that you can lose a game that fast with nothing to do with bad game play is annoying.

:thumbsdown: It&#039;s a brutal game. I really dislike leaving a game feeling defeated like that. While losing isn&#039;t the worst thing in gaming, getting the shit kicked out of you when you had no chance in hell, is just not fun.

All that being said, I will definitely pull this out again and give it another go or 2. If I get blown away like that, though, it won&#039;t see my table time again, sadly. It was fun enough to play and set up a game plan, but when I lost after 5 minutes of playing, I sat there thinking to myself... &quot;Are you freaking kidding me?&quot;</body>

Just a terrible month for hitting anything. Or sinking what I hit. I had just one less contact in February than in March but I sunk 10 fewer ships and 6,000 fewer tons. What I recall of this month is an endless string of misses and dud hits (6 dud hits, 4 damaged results). I had so many potential good targets at 5,000 to 10,000 tons that I had decent odds at hitting which turned out to be unproductive. I actually didn&#039;t sustain any lost submarines, which was cool. The last week I needn&#039;t have bothered playing as I only had 8 submarines that were in patrol status. 

Oh well. Off to beef up my geeky tracking spreadsheet again and get set for another attempt.

Wow, what a difference. This must be the best I&#039;ve ever done by the first three weeks. I put ships on the bottom each week, most notably during the third week of December where my subs put 6 on the bottom for 19,000 tons. The most exciting attack was the USS Tambor splitting its initial attack against two marus. With 20% odds to hit each, she hit and sunk both! Most of my sinkings have been against ships weighing 3-5 thousand tons which has helped scoot me up. I&#039;ve been reattacking a lot (36.5% of my attacks are reattacks, yet I&#039;ve only sunk 1 ship during those reattacks).

Sadly, contact with the USS Sturgeon was lost while she was enroute back to base at Manila while passing through the North Philippine Sea.

I seemed to get unbelievably successful rolls in nearly every aspect of the game this month. I did far better than my good showing in December with more subs on patrol, more subs hitting, and more hits causing ships to sink. I sunk one ship worth 18,000 tons and another worth 15,000. I&#039;ve been able to land hits on a lot of ships worth 3,000 - 5,000 which has been great for my numbers. I did great on my endurance checks and kept a lot of subs in service for 2-3 weeks in a row before returning to base. My repair rolls were also great and I&#039;ve been moving damaged subs through the repair process quickly. Several times my damage results turned out to be superficial and required no down time. I was also fortunate that I didn&#039;t have any War Events that disrupted my plans. Apparently the Philippines are still holding on and though I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of action in the Aleutians that campaign hasn&#039;t officially started yet. I&#039;ve also been lucky and haven&#039;t lost any additional subs this month.

I can&#039;t believe I met my goal with four weeks to spare. I&#039;ve never made this much tonnage in 11 weeks, let alone just 7. Looking forward to seeing at least an additional three months of the game. If I can keep up the pace I&#039;m sinking ships I&#039;ll be able to start rolling for torpedo improvement in 14 weeks or so.</body>

Until today and I got my first play in.  I enjoyed it, but didn&#039;t love it.  I can see me playing the official solitaire rules several more times and then setting it aside...The nice thing is that there are different solo rules out there and get the feeling I will experiment with one or the other.</body>

	<body>Saw the video for this game and loved the theme. I knew I had to take a risk on the gameplay. 

The game comes with dedicated solitaire rules but I played it controlling two manufacturers.
 
The game is essentially a race to make the most money by claiming manufacturing contracts and quickly turning your money into safe gold or run the risk of inflation devaluing your Marks.

To gain your contracts you need to design technology to improve your fighters, recon aircraft and bombers. You can employ specialists and aces or be sneaky and steal technology from yor opponents.

Better still you can play event cards to burn down factories, build extra factories for yourself or one of many other actions.

This is a great under-hyped game. It was a good experience on my own but I can see it really coming into its own with numerous players. Seek it out and have a look.</body>

So this is an older game - and I played it on Tabletop Simulator mostly to learn how it works )I have a play of [thing=181521]Warhammer Quest[/thing] scheduled this week with a friend - I&#039;ve played thru the campaign and Delve many times)

:thumbsup: Reminded me of Warhammer Quest
:thumbsup: Takes place in the Warhammer 40K universe (WH was my first miniatures game ages ago - yes I&#039;m really that old)
:thumbsup: TTS makes playing simple
:thumbsup: Won my first game - double checked the rules looks like i didn&#039;t screw up
:thumbsdown: Very dice dependant
:thumbsdown: it&#039;s old and I don&#039;t own a copy yet...

	<body>A second bout of this utterly absorbing game, this evening. I&#039;m stunned how they&#039;ve made it this accessible and fun. As much as I think High Frontier is a masterpiece, it took me the better part of an hour to work out how to move my ship. You&#039;re up and running with this so much more swiftly. The rulebook is really clear and concise... but it [i]is[/i] mathy. (Just not enough to scare me away.)

Didn&#039;t get to play Letters from Whitechapel with our guest - ended up in Catan again. Great game but, every once in a while, you seem to have a turkey when you just can&#039;t get anything up and running. Felt interminably long. 

And, in surprising news, my wife has asked me to teach her A Study in Emerald - as the Sherlock Holmes connection has intrigued her. A) it&#039;s the first edition (i,e.: the good one); B) I suspect she has a slightly misguided idea about how much Holmes features; C) I&#039;m really hoping to win the copy of Consulting Detective in the generosity thread, as I think we&#039;d have a great few evening pouring over it. (And it&#039;s likely to satisfy the Sherlock itch she&#039;s suddenly developed.)

Getting harder and harder to be a solo gamer, right now; too many willing gamers around these parts. :)</body>

	<body>You know that feeling when you played something wrong the past 5 times that you&#039;ve played the game, only to realize the mistake at the beginning of a new game and then having to adjust... yep, just happened.

I had been playing that each diamond on the quest cards were the number of people that you had to put on the quest, not the number of rounds to complete it.  Now that I corrected this to the right rule it made the quick start on my epic game much harder.

I managed to get to the last round of the 2nd set of cards, but couldn&#039;t close out the purple due to some bad resource management in the mines.  I fell short to complete that quest and ended the game there.  

Back to the drawing board...</body>

	<body>[i]Part of my [listitem=4426212]2016 10×10 Challenge[/listitem].[/i]


I&#039;ve started planning for a longer campaign. I picked this campaign specifically so that I had enough points to try the linked aircraft and the AC-130. I thought about trying out a Drone or two, but SO points will be hard to come by in the campaign, so I decided to be a little frugal. When choosing pilots for this campaign, the primary quality I was looking for was the Evasion skill.


[b]Campaign/Situation[/b]: Iran (2014) - Cut-Off (5 Days)
[u]Optional Rules[/u]: none
[u]Campaign Squad[/u]:
2 × Scouts
2 × AH-64D - &quot;Cougar&quot; (Av), &quot;Eagle&quot; (Av), &quot;Shadow&quot; (Av)
2 × A-10C - &quot;Halo&quot; (Av), &quot;Rebel&quot; (Av), &quot;Thor&quot; (Av)
1 × AC-130 - &quot;Neon&quot; (Av), &quot;Zinger&quot; (Av)


[i][b][u]EDIT 1[/u][/b][/i]
[b]Day 1[/b]
[u]Special Condition[/u]: Satellite Recon Data

[u]Target/Range[/u]: Fuel Depot (5S) - Enemy Transit
[u]Target-Bound Event[/u]: MLRS Bombardment
[u]Home-Bound Event[/u]: Enemy Aircraft
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]:
1 × A-10C (6 × LAU-68)
1 × AC-130
1 × Scout
[u]Summary[/u]: Lost the Scout on my first mission of the campaign. This doesn&#039;t bode well. At least the MLRS Bombardment took out 4 of the 16 units in the area. Even with only 4 turns available to loiter, the squad still made short work of the rest of the targets.

[u]Target[/u]: Tank Leader (11S) - Friendly Transit
[u]Target-Bound Event[/u]: SAM Attack
[u]Home-Bound Event[/u]: SA-7 Attack
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]:
2 × AH-64D (2 × AIM-92, 2 × LAU-68, 2 × Mk.82)
1 × A-10C (2 × LAU-68, 4 × Mk.83, 1 × Fuel Tank)
[u]Summary[/u]: Lost the other Scout on the second mission of the campaign. Then &quot;Cougar&quot; miscalculated his position, putting him in the cross-hairs of two AAA&#039;s and one Tank, resulting in him being killed. The remaining two aircraft managed to wipe out the rest of the battalion, but it was a hollow victory.

:thumbsup: Love the AC-130, although you really need to reorient your thinking in order to account for its firing arc.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown::thumbsup: Game feels quite a bit tougher than Hornet Leader. Or, at least, I haven&#039;t really figured out the strategies of this game yet.


[i][b][u]EDIT 2[/u][/b][/i]
[b]Day 2[/b]
[u]Special Condition[/u]: Resupply

[u]Target/Range[/u]: Command Unit (1C) - Enemy Rear
[u]Target-Bound Event[/u]: Creative Navigation
[u]Home-Bound Event[/u]: Reporting For Duty
[u]Squad (&amp; Ordinance)[/u]: 1 × AC-130
[u]Summary[/u]: I hadn&#039;t realised how nasty SAM&#039;s are, not having really faced them yet. My AC-130 got shot up really bad, causing &quot;Zinger&quot; to become a gibbering wreck. However, he managed to get the plane home and he reduced the enemy battalion to half-strength.

[u]Summary[/u]: I miscalculated and started &quot;Eagle&quot; in a really bad position. He got shot-up a few turns in a row and eventually his helicopter crashed. Thankfully, the SAR team was able to pick him up, but he won&#039;t be flying again for at least a day. &quot;Shadow&quot; managed to knock the battalion down to half strength, but I was really counting on them to destroy it. The worst part is that the supply sergeant had just finished replacing the other lost Apache!

[u]Summary[/u]: This mission went much smoother than the other two today. The Warthogs are real workhorses! The mission proved to be a little stressful for the pilots, but the battalion was wiped-out.

:thumbsdown: I really don&#039;t have a handle on the tactics and strategy of this game yet.
:thumbsup: Still awesome, even if it&#039;s seriously laying the smackdown on me.

:thumbsup: I&#039;m really starting to grasp how to use the Warthog.
:thumbsdown: I&#039;m still tactically clueless with the Apache.
:thumbsup::thumbsup: The AC-130 is still a beast (and a neat tactical puzzle)!</body>

	<body>Pandemic is my favorite game. I have logged around 75 plays since picking it up back in 2013. I am not sure why it took me so long to get this one on  the table. Perhaps because I had a bad experience with Defenders of the Realm and the dice scared me away. Anyway, I just started playing it last month and have already logged 21 plays with the base game. What makes it so unique? For me it is the pace of the game. It is not as much of a brain burning puzzle as Pandemic, but running around, putting out fires, and saving people is just exciting. I have had a few games ruined by dice rolls, but that is certainly the exception rather than the rule. I play on the back of the board (harder side) typically on veteran with 4 random characters. With that my win pct is right around 60 or 70% which for me is the sweet spot, it is a very well balanced game that scales well with different player counts and difficulty levels. I have played about 10 heroic games on the back side as well, pulling out wins in 3 of them. I am not sure I like it that hard though, many of the losses I never even had a chance to win. Will it replace Pandemic? Never. It provides a great alternative. I can play 2 games in the same amount of time and the experience is similar enough they are comparable, but different enough that I feel they have managed to completely differentiate themselves. 

:thumbsup: Pace of the game is amazing. It has such a great flow from turn to turn. 

:thumbsup: Setup and tear down is super easy once you have done it a few times. 

:thumbsup: Plays very quick solo, can squeeze a game in any time, but I usually don&#039;t because I can&#039;t stop playing! Most of my sessions have been 3 or 4 (today I played 6 in a row) in a row.

:thumbsdown: Not much really, the dice can screw you occasionally but at the same time they add a great deal of excitement. </body>

	<body>OK, time for my 2 week post. I think I can live with this schedule as trying to post every game I play just gets me stressed out and takes away from the joy I get from playing each game.

Playing a fair amount of solo games lately. Some pnp, including this little gem that I posted on Tabletop Simulator. Also some plays of [thing=146652][/thing], and [thing=180593][/thing]. And rounding it out with playtesting my project which I think have decided will end up in the summer solitaire contest.

I really enjoyed this specific pnp as it felt different from other heroes attack monsters games that I have played. There are 7 different heroes to choose from and 5 or 6 scenarios to play. 

I choose to take the Druid, the Barbarian, and the Ranger out for a spin. I learned from the designer that I played the Barbarian wrong, but I don&#039;t think it would have made a huge difference. I chose to play the Goblin Raiding party scenario.

The premise of the game is to defend a narrow pass against a huge army looking to go plundering your lands. Only 2 characters or monsters can actually fit in each section of the pass and if any monster gets through, then you lose the game. Your characters can level up and do all sorts of cool abilities but when the big baddies come stomping through, you had better be prepared.

In the full game that I played, the big hulking monster was one of the first monsters to enter the pass. He managed to whittle my druid down to one life. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t bring any healers on this adventure, so that would be the amount of life he would have for the rest of the game. He did level once though, and gained a really useful ability that through dangerous leaves down the pass and did one damage to the creature that it hit. It made him useful at least until I sacked him when the charging minotaur came through the pass. Good fun. I had managed to level my Barbarian to full strength and that helped take out the minotaur and win me the game!

:thumbsup: Good print and play. A lot of thought went into the design.
:thumbsup: Good amount of variety. You will only use up to three of the seven characters and you will only attack certain monsters in the game and the path itself changes from game to game giving you different tactical decisions.
:thumbsup: No Dice combat. It is deturministic, but it works just fine and gives the game real strategy.
:thumbsup: :thumbsdown: Low tech. Easy on the ink cartridge, but not pretty. Mostly a wall of text.
:thumbsdown: This game is unbeatable if the big bad monster comes out early. You won&#039;t stand a chance. (but then I guess you could shuffle him into the second half of the beast deck if you chose too.</body>

I played another 3 games this morning and failed again. Who would have thought? :p

First team made it out alive on their first run but they all went down in their second try.

Those Elvis clones here gave me a hard time during my second try:

[ImageID=2880519 large]

But they were nothing compared to what my second team had to face during their second round:

[ImageID=2880521 large]
[ImageID=2880520 large]

I am having a blast with this game! Nice beatdown every time. I manage to get through the first round every time but the second one... there is always one runner who can&#039;t handle what is in front of him / her and that&#039;s the beginning of the end. I need to find a way to beat that second round! :arrrh:

I&#039;m off to find a perfect team and then I&#039;m back to [-]kick some ass[/-] get beat down again!

Edit:

4th game for today. Now with the Oni character...

[ImageID=2881012 large]

I ran through the first scene with a few hits taken only but that second scene just hates me. Oni was the first one to go critical... :D</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve got FW in a trade and was eager to get this öne to the table. Four games in I&#039;m enjoying it immensely. 

I played three normal games and one epic game.

I lost my first learning game on turn 3 because I completely mismanaged the mine and had no resources to kit out my adventurers. 

The second game went a bit better but I lost on turn 4 because I had no money to buy any weapon receipts and I needed an axe. 

It’s really interesting to see how scarce money can be if you don&#039;t plan ahead. The only ways to generate money are rest (1), sell resources (wich you don&#039;t do) and to complete quests. I think the last option is key, but I&#039;m not completely sure how to do it. 

I won the third game with a score of 118 (125 is a good score for the normal game). 
[ImageID=2880581medium]
It really made my brain hurt in a good way. The constant pressure to complete all quests and juggling the level ups and weapons of your adventures makes for a really satisfying solo experience. The mine phase is an interesting puzzle ... one I&#039;m terrible at. The third game went really well and I always had enough resources, but I&#039;m unsure if it was luck or if I wrapped my head around the mine.

After my brilliant win in the normal game I setup an epic game ... and lost on the first turn of stage 2 because I acquired too hard/diverse quest in stage one, failed to buy iron weapons designs and underestimating the quest requirements of stage two. 
[ImageID=2880582medium]
I think I&#039;m going to do a few more normal games before tackling the epic game again :D.

:thumbsup: unique design with the three different stages
:thumbsup: Solo game has win/loss condition in addition to VPs
:thumbsup: components/artwork/rulebook
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: not sure about the mining phase.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: switch between stages in epic game is fiddly and takes some time
:thumbsdown: a bit of a table hog
:thumbsdown: I&#039;m thinking about pre-ordering Gloomhaven now

	<body>Decided that is was time to try out one of the expansion nations, and having forgotten to list this particular nation (amongst others) when talking about the game, Japan became my choice for this session.

Japan is fairly unique amongst the nations thus far in that it comes with a starting Advisor (Emperor) that cannot be replaced. You keep it for the entire game, and when you hire a new one they are immediately discarded and you get a permanent bonus to military instead. It&#039;s not much, but it does make it worth considering a military strategy for them even when playing solo. They also start with Hokkaido, which is essentially an empty slot that does nothing till you place something over it.

[imageid=2880570 medium]

Silk Road came out again, so I was more than happy to play with it, but I was unable to get my stone production up and running at all in the first 2 ages, which severely hampered my effort, meaning that I was spending a lot of my growth phases collecting stone instead of other resources or workers. Not as much of a problem on Prince difficulty, but on higher levels it would hurt a lot more. By end game I was better off, but I had wasted too much time and resources for too little game, and I finished with a score of [COLOR=#FF0033]42[/COLOR], my lowest to date. (I&#039;m sure that worse scores are possible, and it isn&#039;t much short of the next score above it, so it can&#039;t be that bad, but you&#039;d hope that as we play games we get better.) Luck does have a role in this game, with what the Shadow player rolls and what progress cards come out (which can be mitigated by using the officially recognized variant of limiting card types to maximum numbers when laying them out for better distribution; which in the case of solo is  6 building and 2 each of any other type - it still leads to a lot of variance but prevents some extreme layouts such as 4-5 military cards when you only really want 1-2), but that is part of the skill of the game as well, reacting to circumstances.

[imageid=2880583 medium]

Not happy with that first run I decided to give them another go. The dice rolls were much kinder on the second run too, wiping the columns less frequently, which enabled me to purchase more cards. Archers on the first turn gave me a decent raid value, and it wasn&#039;t till late game that I replaced them. Wonder gave me the majority of my military for most of the game, topped up by the Emperors special ability, and I only ever ended up using 1 military worker. Much more efficient. Again early stone was an issue (this seems to be a trend for me?), but the high raid meant that battkes gave me plenty of stone, so it didn&#039;t matter as much this time round, and I was also able to capitalize on wonders (Yay for Hawaii - a free worker w/o upkeep is awesome :)). I also played their first dynasty down, which significantly contributed to the final book total of 74! All round a good game with a final score of [COLOR=#FF0033]56[/COLOR], my best yet.</body>

	<body>Played another solo game of this.  I managed to beat the AI due to money: I had 22VP, it had 18VP; it got 4.6VP from its money; I got 3.6VP from my money, giving me the win with 25.6 to 22.6 [yes, the game says you get 1/10ths of a point per coin, I assume to help with tie-break situations].

Still really enjoying how quick this is to play, with interesting decisions to make.

UPDATE: Played another game of this last night.  I managed to beat the AI 26.6 to 16.6.  HA, take that AI!  I think I&#039;m getting the hang of how to screw the AI over too well. :)</body>

	<body>Played against the Hard Rogue galaxy.  Lost, again.  Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever won against it (I&#039;ve beaten the Epic rogue, ironically!).  It managed to upgrade its empire by 3 steps in quick succession; I had no culture or energy to force a re-roll.

Score just before the AI won was: Me: 17VP, AI: 13VP, but it just pipped me to the win.

[imageid=2880665 large]

I still feel the Hard and Epic rogues are too powerful at upgrading their empires, if they get good dice rolls.  It&#039;s all very well having the player ability to use 1 energy + 1 culture to force a re-roll, but when the AI is rolling 7 dice and has just got 3 extra dice from maxing its culture, then there&#039;s no way you can counteract it rolling *10* dice, and it&#039;s entirely likely that the AI will roll at least enough energy to upgrade its empire with that many dice.  It did that 3 turns in a row (well, with 6 dice in the penultimate two rounds), maxing its culture each time and getting the 3 extra rolls, and maxing its energy each time too, upping its empire level.

I&#039;m wondering about a variant to the rogue galaxies such that if they get to their max empire level, they don&#039;t auto-win, they just trigger sudden-death: You get one more turn to try to get enough VP to beat them.  Give them, say, +14VP at that max level (the prior level is 10VP so 14 seems a fair whack).  You&#039;d have to keep a very close score to them to make that work, but I think it would feel like more of a final battle instead of a sudden &quot;oh, ok, they&#039;ve won then&quot;.  In my game above, the AI would have had 17VP, and so would I.  I would have needed just 2 Diplomacy dice on my turn to get the 5VP Zavodnick planet which would have won me the game. :)

Any comments on that variant thought?  I may post that in the game&#039;s forums as a variant too, to get feedback.</body>

	<body>It was a good day to solo-game yesterday, clearly.  Getting in 3 solo games of not-short-length in is pretty good for me!

Last game of the day was this - Forbidden Island.  I&#039;ve not won this in a while, but I decided to start at Elite level just for the heck of it.  I was going to play with 3 characters, which is generally easier to win with, so I was hopeful.

I also used a variant island layout (Bone Island) and chose from the fan-made variant characters (well, I just shuffled all 25 together and picked the first 3).  I got: Doctor, Adventurer, and Bricklayer.  As I often find if you use all variant characters, their powers weren&#039;t super helpful.  They&#039;re powers are certainly thematic, but they tend to be fairly underpowered (they&#039;re very specific to certain situations, and if those situations don&#039;t arise, you can&#039;t use the ability at all which feels like a waste).

As it was, I used the Doctor&#039;s power once (near the beginning of the game) to get a character to the other side of the island, and the Adventurer&#039;s power once (near the end of the game) to shore up Fools Landing which we were next to.

I *just* won!  Which is the best kind of victory.  One more Waters Rise card would have finished us off (note the level of the flood indicator!).  But the Adventurer (on the penultimate turn) drew a sandbag and a flame card - phew!  On the Bricklayer&#039;s turn (the final turn), he was the only remaining character not on Fools&#039; Landing - he walked across the wet ground around the Temple of the Sun and onto the launch pad of Fools&#039; Landing, and the Doctor&#039;s helicopter card let him radio for the Helicopter to lift us away to safety!  Yeah!  Ancient island artefact plundering FTW!  Well, this stuff DOES belong in a museum, after all. :)

I checked what the next 2 treasure cards would have been just to see - one was a Waters Rise card, which would have killed us.  Talk about winning by the scruffs of our necks!

[imageid=2880671 medium]
[i]Game end - the island was about to disappear beneath the waves, but we made it to the helicopter in the nick of time![/i]</body>

	<body>Long time since my last play of FC:R.

North Africa campaign again...

I took the fortress without any trouble at all. Very lucky die rolls included.

[ImageID=2880684 large]

The allies tried to take it back but, again lucky die rolls made me hold Tobruk without any problems.

[ImageID=2880685 large]

So I headed for Alexandria and Cairo.

[ImageID=2880690 large]

And this is the hard part about this map. I was knocking on both doors but the allies got so much reinforcements there each round that they crushed my troops and took back what was once allied territory.

I think I must be way quicker. Exploit is the key here. Risking it all.

Next time...</body>

On the same day I had arranged local pick-up and yesterday evening I went through the tutorial scenario and stopped just before the begining of the big enemy raid, because, you know, it was time to go to bed. I made photos of the board status and am hoping to return during this week for finishing.

Inspired by [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-XABrU4Els]the Ant Lab solitaire playthrough video[/url] I threw this on to the table today.

Just played the normal game again, still building up to the epic, and felt like I breezed through the first 6 rounds.  Well, it&#039;s all relative, I say breezed but what I mean was some heavy thinking and forward planning got me through relatively comfortably with spare resources and even on occasion spare money!  Money is tight in this game.

Then in the final round I thought I had failed for the want of an axe.  However, with some nimble quest management I managed to complete the final quest and finish the game!  Yes.

Final score = 131

Great game.</body>

	<body>Recently got the 1st undead pack

and i&#039;ve been lugging it around  local game groups but not played with another human as yet, as game groups tend to focus on multi-players :-)

so played decided to play solo just played the best play for both sides. was fun, with my heart siding for the knights to win

really pretty and nice game very fluid.

Knights did win, but i think i forgot a scenario rule that would have made me role less dice vs the Daemon army

looking forward to a few more solo play though 
its encouraged to pick up other packs as the models are gorgeous and great to paint

	<body>I got a little tired of playing really short games ([thing=96703][/thing], [thing=42651][/thing], [thing=36659][/thing]) so got a hankering for playing something a bit longer with more depth.

Ok.... So now what?  I think this was the problem I had the LAST time I tried to play Raid - I&#039;ve read the rules, but still have no idea what I&#039;m supposed to be doing.  While the rulebook is pretty clear as far as WHAT the rules are, it&#039;s an old school game in the sense that there is no tutorial or walkthrough of HOW you actually play it. Of WHAT you are supposed to be doing.  There is a [i]Victory Point[/i] section, telling you the Brits win with 70 VP (and historically achieved 53VPs) but nothing as far as WHAT TO DO.  The game log contains Historical targets (which I guess you are supposed to blow up) and the VP section suggests to play around with different landing zones and targets, but again, its lacking any kind of &quot;THIS IS WHAT YOU DO&quot; section.

I set the board up, but now I either cull the old General Magazine articles for insight into what&#039;s expected of me, or just work my way through the Sequence of Play, and wing it with the historical references until I get a grasp as to what&#039;s going on.

[imageid=2885554large]
[i] All set up with no place to go! [/i]

Turn 1:
I&#039;m using the Travel Guide to St Nazaire from the old General Magazine as a tutorial.  This is basically a walk-through for your first raid - definitely needed to help figure out what you are doing, and what to do. These first few stages can be brutal for your ships trying to get into dock.  just watching the ships be decimated as they attempt to land makes you wonder what the actual historical raid was like, and the brave British Commandos that went on it.

 I&#039;m actually surprised most of my ships survived to Turn 2. A lot got Turned Away or Evaded, with some mass casualties, and only two On Fire, but most made it towards the port.  I missed the Torpedo shot against the Sperrbrecher 137 in the harbor.  So I&#039;m either going to use valuable time taking another shot at it, or just chance my luck to unload more commandos.

[imageid=2891423large]
[i] End of Turn 1. Most of the Ships actually survived.... so far.[/i]

[b]Turn 2:
Well, THAT was painful.  The Germans allowed me to breathe a little easy before they opened up on my units as they got closer.  Turn 2 was brutal on my boats.  3 more were either totally destroyed or on fire.  I had some of them pick up the survivors before I made landing.  I was able to land about a dozen commando groups and then had to decide where the assault troops would be best placed.  I&#039;ve been rolling low for the German movement, so the activated GE troops in the Northern and Western holding areas are trapped there for now. I was able to set some charges at the Pump House and destroy that location, but not before the guns on top killed Roy&#039;s Commando team and wounded Purdon&#039;s down to almost ineffectual. i also tried assaulting the guns on the Old Mole, only to be eliminated as well.

Geez, this game is brutal. [/b]

	<body>[b]Two Attempted Last-Round Knockout Blows, One Landed | A Third, Ugly Way Out[/b]

I had another letdown followed by redemption against Arkayne. In both attempts, I was able to get a good start, then was thwarted by the capture of new hostages, then able to set up a make-or-break combo that had some chance of success.

In the first attempt, I had squirreled away two minor extractions and a major extraction (enough to clear out the hostages and get Arkayne to surrender), and conceded an escape demand and a minor demand to load up on dice at the pivotal event. I beat the odds in a very unsatisfying way by whiffing on a minor extraction attempt (2 4s, 3 blanks, not enough cards to convert a 4), ending the game.

In the second attempt, the pivotal event moved the threat level to S, enabling me to save hostage when lowering the threat level. 2 successes in the first threat roll gave me a bonus conversation point that made all the difference. I was able to lower the threat level again, leaving two hostages and the abductor. I cashed in three cards to be able to concede the escape demand, giving me 5 dice to roll for a major extraction that would need 2 successes. I had two cards left to convert a 4, and ended up rolling one success and two 4s; I cashed in two cards and grabbed the last two hostages, with one spare saved hostage to capture Arkayne.

That result was satisfying, and took the bad aftertaste away from the previous botched extraction and a previous win by ugly circumstances. In that game, I had three remaining hostages (and only one dead hostage), a threat level at 6, and the pivotal event reduced my dice by one (keeping me at one dice regardless of what I could do with the threat level). With the media demand and two re-rolls available, I conceded the media demand, killing another hostage but enabling me to pull a desperation card from the deck. This gave me two hostages and the abductor to clear, needing a single success on one dice with two re-rolls. The first roll was a 4, enabling me to cash in the two re-roll cards to convert to a success, saving three hostages (the two remaining, plus capturing the abductor). I am not a fan of intentionally allowing a hostage to die, but it was the only path I could see to clear all hostages plus one out of the pool with one dice available. 

Hopefully I will gain some clarity to alternative ways to win in those situations with some experience, or at least confirm that sometimes you do need to sacrifice some hostages at the end to capture the bad guy.</body>

	<body>(Sigh)

So I have run my first practice run of February Rallycup. It was fine, it was fun and I look forward to another tonight. The ever wonderful post office has delivered my two starter packs for Baseball Highlights. Texas &quot;Go Rangers&quot; and Chicago &quot;Had a thing for the White Sox for years&quot; not sure why but love their off white and black pin stripes. Even when coaching my son&#039;s little league team chose the SOX as our team. Looking forward to playing a round with another team. However...

Now I sit here while the red beans simmer on the stove and a strange feeling has come over me and I would like to share for whomever chooses to listen.

My wife is currently 4 hours away in Houston at MD Anderson getting her semi annual cancer scans. She was diagnosed in 2012 and since her last of three surgeries has been clear at every scan. What I would like to talk about though the palpable pall that enters the homes of those that have to suffer through this each and every year. These will happen for the rest of our lives together and the relief that comes from a clear scan is so... wonderful.  

It&#039;s these times that truly suck though. I&#039;m home with the kids because they have school and I have to work and there isn&#039;t another place I&#039;d rather be than with her at the Dr. What&#039;s the big deal? Everything will be fine. She beat it!!! Right. My daughter is outside playing with a friend in the cul de sac and Kyle keeps asking when dinner will be ready. We have done well keeping these times normal. As normal as possible I suppose. No big deal but a couple of weeks before the time comes to go and you get the phone call reminder of your upcoming scans you start to get quiet... 

We get a little more testy... less patient... jobs seem to mean less. (Not that they do but it becomes harder to concentrate each day.) Peanut our dog is sleeping in her spot wondering when she will get back home. Her mother takes these trips with her as she is retired and they make it a mother daughter get away. They will eat out and talk and shop and life goes on. 

There has been so many recent passings due to cancer and lists on this site of people getting diagnosed and it just brings everything all back. The year after the first diagnosis is an absolute bitch. The crying about the unknown, the planning, the surgery...that doesn&#039;t sound so bad, yeah right, it is heart breaking to see your spouse go through the surgeries and the radiation and the loss of weight. She got to 95 lbs at the worst and people would say &quot; Oh wow, you look great, what diet did you do?&quot; They were lucky I was civilized and didn&#039;t punch them through the nearest wall. In what screwed up world does an adult women look good at 95 lbs. She was a skeleton with skin. Then you beat it. You go to scans and for three years they are clean but the idea, the fact that you have to go back every six months for the rest of your life is dreadful. Hopeful, relieved, scared, dread, happy, worried... 

I apologize for the dark mood. I will sit tonight. I will eat a wonderful meal with my kids and we will talk and we will say a little prayer as I tuck everyone in. I will sit and play a game or two to pass the time before I go to bed. Not even asking for anything from you guys. 

Just wanted to say if any of you are a survivor, if any of you are a caregiver for a survivor, if any of you have lost a loved one or are currently going through this ordeal with a loved one. You are all in my thoughts... I&#039;m sorry you had to go through this... 


Edit: [imageid=2881896 small]

Samantha came up to me. &quot;Daddy while dinner is cooking would you like to play Battle Sheep and maybe Tetris Link?&quot; 

&quot;Why yes, that would be perfect&quot;

I won 2/3 battle sheep and she destroyed me at tetris link. 

I don&#039;t know all the things that God puts into kids but whatever it is that helps them say and do everything right when you need them too is absolutely awesome.

And finally, with 23 cards including 6 allies under Black Magga, that was a defeat. The scenario&#039;s ability made me trash too much cards at the beginning ; 12 in 4 turns.

[listitem=4360615]After two failed attempts at defeating the SoloPlay AI last month[/listitem], I have found redemption with a Perfect Game score.  Woot!  As I stated last month, my usual strategy is to invade as many worlds as possible early so that I have a large energy production for late game recruiting and deployment.  This usually allows me to invade two Core Worlds that hopefully align with my overall strategy so I can gain those bonus points.

[ImageID=2882021medium]
[i]Around Midgame[/i]

For this session, however, I took a more deliberate approach.  By Sector III, I had only invaded three worlds.  But I was keeping a sharp eye on what the AI was doing, always trying to stay a point or two ahead wherever possible.   My one concern was the Galactic Orders.  The AI was adding a steady stream of his faction tokens to the GO tiles.  These will become VPs at the end of the game if I don&#039;t catch up. 

Another change I made this session was using the GO tiles for their special actions.  Previously, I would let my faction tokens build up as well so I could try to score a few extra points at the end.  Instead, I used up several of my tokens so as to gain extra energy or some ability to help my cause.  This definitely worked for me as I was able to acquire two large Capital Ships.  And using a specialized tactics card to reduce the cost of deployment, these helped to invade a couple of large worlds late in the game.  

[ImageID=2882022medium]
[i]Deploying my Capital Ship, the War Byrd, and a Medibot[/i]

Nearing the end, I felt pretty good about my chances.  I had the opportunity to invade invade one of the Core Worlds on the final turn but to do so would have given the AI access to an 8-point CW of its own.  Instead I picked up two solid Prestige cards to the AI&#039;s one giving me a +3 point spread. 

After adding up the scores, I was delighted to see a +9 score differential, a Perfect
Game.

[u]Comments[/u]:
•  Love this variant!  Very puzzly and thinky.  If you&#039;re interested in trying it, be sure to check out [b]Ava[/b]&#039;s Player Aid and videos.  Super helpful for solo players new to the variant.

•  I like how I can play both for combat strength and for buying power, and be able to win going with either strategy.

•  I tried to not overemphasize the need for the Galactic Orders expansion in my report last month, but it is a fantastic expansion.  Sorry folks.

•  I feel like I should say something negative for balance...there are times, playing this variant, that you&#039;ll need to make sub-optimal moves against your strategy solely so the AI doesn&#039;t acquire a really strong card.  But maybe that&#039;s playing optimally in the long run anyway.</body>

	<body>Setup and going through the walkthrough even though I&#039;m an experienced COIN player. I found the setup to be a little tricky due to the naming of some of the pieces. However once I got going it was ok. The Battle system is much different than the other COIN games and there&#039;s a lot of modifiers. I need to take a look through the player aid to see if they&#039;re all listed, but I imagine that this may turn some new players off. We&#039;ll see if my opinion changes after I get through my first full play.

Update:
So I ended up playing all sides on my first game, and having played other COIN games the actions were quite similar and very easy to adapt to.  The different factions are quite interesting and while tied to each other to gain a main victory condition they also need to temper how much they help - and that&#039;s the crux of this game, which reminds me of Fire in the Lake (although there&#039;s less of a tie to the winning conditions, and more of a general need to partner in that game).

The battles as written in the rulebook could be clearer, but after a few actual battles they are not difficult to calculate, and the player aids have the process outlined which are fairly clear.

Overall, I enjoyed my first play and I&#039;m not sure where it ranks with all of the COIN games for me yet, but I do know that this one is not leaving my collection.</body>

	<body>Here&#039;s a photo of a 3P-Solo game currently in progress, using the Knight, Goblins, and Dragon:

-The Knight currently has 4 Grit, 2 Hero Tokens, the cards shown, and is standing on a tile with an intact Crystal.
-Both of the Goblin Tribes are at Strength 3, standing on Dark tiles.
-The Dragon is in play, but out of reach somewhere off to the left.

It&#039;s the Knight&#039;s turn.  [b]What should she do?[/b]

	<body>I just played an amazing season of Football over the past 2 days. I haven&#039;t played a solo game in a very long time (it used to be a daily habit) so this was really, really nice. 

I won on Level 2 by 3 points and the whole thing came down to the wire and was decided by the last league games in week 10. My Blue team finished the league in 4th place but I won the cup. 

Finally figured out how to play cup and league games at full strength by going after some bonus tiles that gave my team a boost in energy providing I fulfilled the requirement. I also experimented with coaches more in this season than I have in the past. 

...but I obviously still have a lot to learn because some players are beating this on Level 6 apparently. I have no idea how this can even be possible. 

==================================

And in the spirit of heart month I am happy to announce that I appear to have been able to quit a 31 year old smoking habit in the last few days!!! Some of you may know that I have recently released the app version of Baseball Highlights 2045. It has done much better than expected (thanks everyone!) so on the weekend I decided to use some of the proceeds  to treat myself to one of those new fangled vape pencils. A good one that I can tune to my needs and where I can choose the liquids that go in myself. [b]It has been truly miraculous.[/b] From 25+ cigarettes a day down to 0 pretty much instantaneously, effortlessly, with no cravings whatsoever. I can&#039;t imagine myself ever buying another pack of cigarettes now, and I&#039;m having a hard time believing that I&#039;m even saying that. I strongly encourage any heavy smokers here to give it a try.

	<body>So pulled this one out again, ready to give it another go, hopeful of better results.



While my first game went slightly longer, 8 turns, the results were the same, even with 1 barricade and the reserves in and used. The second game ended.... turn 3.

Was pretty bummed out, but figured, what the hell, and played again, seeing as I really didn&#039;t need to set anything up. I put the Zulus back where they started and did a quick fix of the draw deck. This game went much better. I got 2 barricades built and had Hook and the North Wall hero out, and those 2 were worth their weight in gold, continuing to roll well enough to hold the advancing Zulus 3(!) times each. A few turns later, I had the reserves ready if needed, and my volleys killed a few Zulus and/or sent them retreating. Night time came and I got fortunate iMPi draws, and they didn&#039;t advance much. I made it to the end of the deck and tallied up my VP total for shits n&#039; giggles. I scored 52 (or 62? Can&#039;t remember at time of writing this), but I felt it was a great score. Only did 1 heroic sacrifice and lost the doc bringing someone back, so my hero numbers and Zulu casualties were high.

So a much better go this time, but still, this game seems a feast or famine I suppose. I&#039;ll still give it more plays here soon and see how it goes. Losing sucks... badly, and for reasons stated in my first post. The victory seemed a bit hollow, actually, only because I know I got the pulls and skill/decisions seemed to have little to do with the victory. I don&#039;t want to sound like I hated the game, as I didn&#039;t. It wasn&#039;t terrible, I just wish the iMPi chit pulls were a little more balanced. </body>

	<body>Received this today from a recent math trade. I&#039;ve been playing a lot of heavy games recently, so I decided to give this a go. After several games, I finally managed to win one.

So far, I&#039;m quite liking this game. This feels more like what I wanted from Onirim, which I found to be quite disappointing. Hopefully Urbion will eventually be reprinted in a larger edition as well.

I&#039;m a bookkeeper by trade and I find the balancing mechanism strangely soothing. :goo:</body>

[user=suzyvitale] for last month&#039;s SGOYT giveaway. The picture doesn&#039;t even include the DC dice and all the other awesome stuff! I haven&#039;t won anything so cool, since the pair of Doc Marten&#039;s &amp; Green Day tickets for MTV&#039;s Live at the 10 Spot. (And that was a different Century!) :laugh:

[ImageID=2882246 medium]

So, I set up a game:
[center][b]
Spider-Man, Wolverine, Cap, and Kitty Pryde
VS.
Magneto, Juggernaut, Emma Frost, and Falcon[/b][/center]

Spidey&#039;s crew started off good. They were picking apart the bad guys, until they went into a lull with the enemy around 6 life left.

Then Magneto got fielded and brought Spidey&#039;s crew down to 6 too.

Magneto&#039;s crew got hit for 5 more damage! DOWN TO 1 LIFE!

[ImageID=2882245 medium]

With no blockers, 10 damage vs. 6 life, the good guys were spanked. I should&#039;ve kept a sidekick to block.

:thumbsup: This game is slick fun.
:thumbsup: The dice rule.
:thumbsup: Lots of rolling.
:thumbsup: Marvel + Spidey!
:thumbsdown: The rules are written in 4 point font.
:thumbsdown: The playmats explain the rules better than the rulebook.</body>

	<body>Even with the Oni in my team yesterday I was beaten down in scene 2 of the Crossfire mission as usual. So another try this morning. Two new teams...

[ImageID=2882297 large]

Well... second scene again. I was rushing through the first scene and started the second one with almost no runner hit, but that second scene again...

Next team picked by my girlfriend:

[ImageID=2882299 large]

Took me too long to get through the first scene and started the second with too many hard obstacles. How are my girls doing? my girlfriend asks. They are about to die any minute, all of them. Was my answer.

I am addicted! This game is awesome! Tomorrow I get the expansion. Juhu!!!

A question:
Does that Oni start with an upgrade and 4 Karma? Thanks in advance.</body>

	<body>Hello again, folks.
I played yesterday my first play of a game of the [family=120][/family] series, from GMT.

And I loved it. Even when it was the Tanagra scenario (the simplest one) it went in unexpected ways for me, who was controlling both sides! The system is brilliant, allowing for a good amount of uncertainty.
And, as I said, it was the simplest battle. I can&#039;t wait to be confident enough with the rules to tackle Plataea!!


[b]EDIT 10/FEB/2016:[/b] Played the Ephesus scenario. The Persians routed and withdrew at the end, but I keep botching some rules, like forgetting to make the TQ check of the defender units that get engaged in Shock Combat, but the system is great. </body>

	<body>I started working on a solo variant for this last night.  I took as the basis the highly regarded [filepage=63254]solo variant[/filepage] for 7 Wonders, as this game has very similar mechanics, and the only real changes would be how the AIs decide to choose which track to move up if there&#039;s ever a choice.

I only got a little way through as I ran out of time in the end, but it was going pretty well - there were some tough decisions!  I&#039;ll give a brief overview of how I played it.  Not sure how it would pan out to the end, or how the scoring would be for the two AI hands, but it has potential.

So, here&#039;s how I played it:
- Deal out for a 3 player game.  You are one player; there are two AIs, one AI player to your left (LHP) and one to the right (RHP);
- Only you take a &#039;turn&#039;, in the traditional sense.  Each turn, take a card from the top of both LHP&#039;s and RHP&#039;s deck, so you have 2 extra cards.  Choose one card for you (place in your pile), then one for each AI player and place in front of them - face up or face down, I haven&#039;t decided yet.  Face up is easier for you to plan against the AIs, so may be too easy.
- Once you have gone through all your cards, you and both AIs should have 5 chosen cards each.  Shuffle each AI&#039;s cards and place in face-down piles by them.
- Starting with you, play a card from your hand, then play the top card from each AI&#039;s stack, in the turn&#039;s direction order.  If required, make AI choices as per below priority list.
- Once all cards have been played, do scoring for each board as per the round requirement, then reset as per the round requirement.
- Rinse and repeat for all 6 rounds.

AI choices:
- Chivalry Track: LHP always chooses the left-hand track to move up on.  RHP always chooses the right-hand track.
- Galantry Track: If an AI wins 1st or 2nd here, it moves up the track it is lowest on.  If there&#039;s a choice, then for rounds 1-3, choose in priority: Education, then that AI&#039;s non-preferred Tournament.  For rounds 4-6, choose priority: Charity, Dragon Quest, King&#039;s Service.

I think that covers all the basics.  I&#039;ll keep on with developing this and will post the variant if I get it to a working stage!


UPDATE: Played again last night, twice.  First time, I used the above rules I&#039;d outlined; they worked fine and it was enjoyable, but the AIs were nowhere close to reaching my score, so it fell a bit flat after final scoring.

So the second time, I decided on a tweak to the drafting: I used a Biblios-style draft - don&#039;t deal out cards at all, but for each draft, pick 3 cards from the deck, one at a time.  You must give yourself a card, LHP a card and RHP a card, but you can&#039;t look at what&#039;s coming up first; it&#039;s a trade off of whether you REALLY want the card you just picked up, or whether you want to hold out for a potentially better one.  This method really worked well; it gave some pretty agonising decisions on which cards to keep and which to give to the AI players.

I also tweaked the per-round scoring too: Any time there was a 3rd player score option I allowed the AIs to score that (even though you&#039;re not meant to in a 3 player game).  I didn&#039;t allow myself to score if I was in 3rd though.

The final score was 31 (me) to 26 (RHP) to 12 (LHP).  So I tweaked the scoring a bit too: Any time the AIs got negative points from the Scholars track, -3s counted as -1s instead.  This boosted RHP to a winning 34 points (and LHP to 14 - still didn&#039;t get enough to get near me).  This felt much more balanced and a better challenge.

So, I&#039;ll write up these rules and put them on the game&#039;s variants forum.

	<body>I bought myself [thing=174226][/thing] last month and I was missing 32 cards. Instead I had 34 other cards twice.

I wrote [company=3][/company] about it.

I just received the missing cards and already sleeved the game. Awesome service! Thanks a ton. :thumbsup:

Off to finally read the rules...</body>

	<body>Spent some time last night learning the rules for this lost Nick Hayes game.

After two and a half plays, I think I can safely say that the game is definitely related to [thing=75223][/thing]. Same kind of dice rolling decision making with a focus on combat. You want to combat.  Need to combat. 

I&#039;m not very good at Utopia Engine combat.

Looking forward to trying this again.  I want to get five games under my belt before I say more about it. </body>

	<body>This has been on my basement hideaway table for four days or so.  I&#039;m trying to survive the entire Battle of Britain.  Butterfield does it again.  Every flip of a card gives you a sense of dread and difficult decisions to make.  Do I send my planes against this wave, or save them for a possible bigger wave later?  Or do I let the bigger wave through and use greater numbers to cause more damage to a smaller wave, hoping to destroy more German planes?

When both countries are playing a war of attrition, every lost plane is important.

I&#039;m at around August 20th or so (I tend to get a bit too immersed to remember those kind of details), and I&#039;ve only resorted to getting two reserves.  I&#039;m at about -10 points, which isn&#039;t as bad as it sounds.  I&#039;ve finally managed to blow up a bomber where there isn&#039;t any more spaces for that type on the replacement track, so that felt good, the first permanent destruction!

I&#039;ve only had 1 stormy day so far, and I could use another as the German&#039;s have had two German Relief draws which have put them far ahead in resources to me.  My rest box is full and I&#039;d prefer to have them on the map.

It&#039;s a very engrossing, but very very long game.  My only :thumbsdown: about it.</body>

	<body>Cheesy box art. Cheesy card title names. Cheesy game title. Frankly, on first ignorant impressions I didn&#039;t think this looked that interesting. But then I watched a Rahdo Runs Through video. And that convinced me to give it a shot.

This is the game I&#039;m playing now:

[imageid=2879992 large]

Absolutely love the cube-pulling from a cup mechanic. Very tense. ANd surprisingly a LOT of interesting decisions to make. So far I&#039;ve lost twice. What a great game.</body>

	<body>Also got this to the table last week. Didn&#039;t finish the game, as I now have to get ready for CON OF THE NORTH, and read a bunch of other rulebooks.

But this COIN is definitely different. The Indians in the long scenario don&#039;t start with any resources. The French are not even on the board and won&#039;t be for almost half the game. This, more than any other COIN, is a team game, at least in the beginning. The British absolutely have to give resources to the Indians to get them rolling. So far, so good with this one.

	<body>Hello,
this is my first entry to this list, which I have already been following for some time. 

I&#039;m a fan of racing games (you can follow my collection and my impressions on Geeklist [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/204727/racing-boardgames-my-journey-2016]Racing Boardgames - My journey in 2016[/url] - I will update and expand the List from time to time).

I have simulated a 2 player game to refresh my knowledge of relevant rules. Really a great game - I had to play it more often! This weekend I will be driving a full rally over several Stages against a friend – yeah.

[ImageID=2580895]

Best regards,
Matthias

	<body>A great example of why I basically quite playing video games to focus on board games full time. As a pandemic fiend I pre-ordered this. My initial reaction was very poor. Or course I started playing on heroic, and was finding that 1 or 2 really bad dice rolls (3 or 4 biohazards) could either end the game or reduce the odds of winning to the extent that it wasn&#039;t even worth playing out. This was such a start contrast to the original Pandemic that I initially wasn&#039;t expecting. Fast forward to this month, I picked it up again and did something very basic....added a house rule. Two biohazard symbols max per turn on the initial roll. 3rd, 4th, or 5th get re-rolled until something else comes up. Now, if I don&#039;t like my rolls and decide to press my luck the next biohazards stick, but at least this way no 4 biohazard roll is going to blow the whole game. 

With this in mind I played 3 games last night. The first on standard, which I won handily with Contagion Specialist, Researcher, and Scientist. Setup a heroic game with the same squad and it was a thrilling finish, with just 1 outbreak left before game end. The final game on heroic I changed up the squad to include the Dispatcher, Medic, and Scientist. This one was also very thrilling. Didn&#039;t get too close on outbreaks but I was in the 5 dice infect section where things start to go bad really quickly. In both heroic games my house rule did come in to play once or twice, and I am glad I did it. My goal when gaming is to have a good time, a thrilling time is even better; so mission accomplished. This also lets me close the loop on this post by circling back to my original comment. With video games when something is broken you either live with it or don&#039;t play. Most of the time you can tweak a board game to your liking, which I think is very special. 

:thumbsup: Very quick. I can play probably 3 games in the time it takes me to lug out Pandemic, now with 3 expansions, sort the cards, setup and play a single game.

:thumbsup: It is not as much of a puzzle as Pandemic, it feels more tactical. There is, however, still some good strategic planning. There is also a bit of a mathy element with the dice. I like all of this. It differentiates itself very well.

:thumbsup: Role integration in to the game is very well done. I love the abilities.

:thumbsdown: Dice. Sometimes I love them, sometimes I hate them. What I really hate is when 1 bad roll can ruin a whole game. This was my biggest complaint with Defenders of the Realm. I could go to boss fight with 13 dice and still loose, then be punished so bad there was no way to recover. In hindsight I should buy that game again and house rule it as well! Anyway, some people are ok with this, but even if you are not there are ways you can fix it to your liking.</body>

	<body>This was a game that I first saw on a report right here in SGOYT right after it had started to get shipped to backers last year.  I thought it looked very cool and kept watching around for it cheep or in a trade.  After missing it twice in a trade I finally just bit the bullet and ordered it from the publisher - boy am I glad I did.

It came in the mail last Friday, I got it on the table Saturday to do a learning play through (which I lost horribly - didn&#039;t even get one safe open) and finally got to play through it for the first time last night.  Sorry, didn&#039;t get any pics to add - but I really wanted to get another post on here this month so here it is...
[size=18][b]
The Heist at the Office[/b][/size]

They are a special group - consisting of members with special skills.  Skills that you just may need to call on if you have been wronged and need someone to get something back for you...they are the Burgle Bros. Inc.  (ok, ok, so I do not necessarily like the idea of being a crook who is steeling from hard working people.  I much more like to think my characters as a group who are using their skills to get back at those who have wrong others - kind of like Repairman Jack in the Repairman Jack books)

Started off my play by setting up the two story office building game.  I randomly drew two characters getting The Hacker and The Raven and picked my starting space (A4).  The guard stayed to the middle and upper right hand of the board for most of the beginning of the game allowing me to quickly find the safe (which was just one tile up from my starting place in A3) and then start to explore the other tiles for the combo and look for the stairs up.

I have to say, I really liked the combo of Hacker and Raven.  Placing the The Raven&#039;s bird to intercept the Guard (caused the guard to loose one movement if passed through the tile with the bird on it) on the first floor made it a lot easier to move my characters where they needed to be.  And the Hacker being able to move through the alarm rooms without setting off the alarms helped to uncover more of the floor without worry that I would bring the guard down on top of me. 

By the time I uncovered all the tiles needed for the combination to the safe I had also found two computer rooms and placed multiple hacking tokens for both the Finger Print Room and the Laser Room (which ended up being very needed seeing as how on floor two there were two Laser grids right next to each other and I had to have the Raven pass through them twice during the game), the Hacker had lost 1 Stealth Token,  and I had a total of four dice to roll for cracking the safe.

I found the stairs (all the way over on the other side of the board in D1)with the Hacker at the same time I cracked the safe with the Raven, and had the Hacker proceed to the next floor - and wouldn&#039;t you know it - the stairs lead right into the next safe. The Raven just needed to make her way across the first floor without getting caught - which was made a little harder by the fact that the loot in the first safe was a mirror that took away one action each turn while being carried (but added the benefit that they alarm would not go off on in the laser room, which I completely forgot about till after the game when I realized I did not need those hacking tokens I left in the computer room earlier)

By the time the Raven had made her way up the stairs, The Hacker had already started exploring the tiles needed for cracking the second safe.  Adjusting to the change in how fast the guard patrolled was harder than I thought, and it cost the Hacker a second Stealth Token.  But he was able to complete the rooms needed to crack the safe and find the stars while the Raven managed to avoid the guard (who made a visit to the safe on his patrol route one time) and work on rolling the dice to get the safe open.  

Finally, the Raven rolled the last number needed and claimed the Chihuahua and some dynamite - which she used to blow out the wall in the safe room and setting off an alarm that brought the guard running.  As the guard made his way to the alarm, the Hacker exited the stairs up and the Raven slipped by in another corridor and made her way to the stairs to got out with the loot.

All in all, I would say a great second run.  I only tripped one alarm, and that was on purpose.  The Hacker did come close to loosing the game for us a couple of times, but I was able to just keep out of the reach of the guard.  I have to say, I really like this game.  When I first set it up and started playing, it seemed very simple to me (take four actions and then move the guard.) But much like Flash Point (which also seemed simple at first) there is quite a bit to consider with each action taken.  More than one time I found my character pinned by the guard and unable to move - causing me to have to draw an event card.  And by the end of this run, I question weather or not I would have been successful if I would have had a third safe to crack.

Final Thoughts[/size][/b]

I am really glad I got this game.  It is great solo, and I can not wait to play it co-op with my kids.  I will note, that after playing I did find something I did wrong, a couple I already pointed out above.  But one mistake I made really would have changed the game.  When playing with less than four burglars you are suppose to discard a certain number of cards from the guards patrol deck ( 3 players discard 3 cards, 2 players discard 6 cards, and 1 player discard 9 cards).  This would have caused me to go through the patrol deck faster and every time you have to reshuffle the patrol deck (you discard the same number of cards again) you add one to the movement speed of the guard.  Next time I will be sure to play with this rule.  Now on to the stars 

:star: Very fun game.  I found my self getting lost in the game more than once as I considered the best actions to take.  

:star: Great art work.  I really like the layout of the tiles.  It is simple and clean and easy to understand what each tile is.  However....

:halfstar: There could have been better written rules on the room tile itself.  Most of the rooms make perfect sense on how they work with what is written on them, but a couple where not as clear.  The Secret Door tile for example:  from the title I did not understand that I could only move into the tile through walls, but not back out so I used this one wrong.  Didn&#039;t figure that out though till I was looking in the rule book afterwards.

:halfstar: Stickers on the meeples.  This could go either way for most people.  I really like having each characters pic on their meeple - but having to put stickers on things is never fun for me.  I just don&#039;t care for it.  (mostly because I am not good at getting them lined up right so they are always a little off center).  It also took me a little while to figure out which meeple went with each character (they are shaped different for each character).This is a very very minor complaint for me.

:halfstar:Game set up and tear down:  There is no way around it - this game takes up a lot of table space for being a small box game.  And it takes a while to shuffle up and deal out 32 tiles (48 if using three floors) and then shuffle all the cards.  It takes a while to set it up.  And putting it back leads me to the final point....

:nostar: The box.  While I really like the look of the box (being shaped like the building you are breaking into is great), and that it is a small and easy to take with you, it is really hard to get all of the pieces back into the box.  I ended up using an Altoids Mint tin to put the wall pieces in with the guards and then another small case to hold all the other pieces and that made it a little easier to put everything back in - but it is not very convenient.  

My final thought - if you like co-op games and modular boards then what are you waiting for.  Go out and get this now.  It is a very good game, that in my opinion, has a great replay value and is challenging to do.  It also plays great one player.  

If I knew how to do the thumb up icon I would give it two thumbs up.  

Edit:  

My final verdict: :thumbsup: :thumbsup:

Another Edit:  Fixed a misspelling of The Raven&#039;s name.

	<body>Picked this up at a reasonable price and have been having a hard time walking away from the table. Fighting the Battle of Minorca. Game one was a British victory with ease. 

[imageid=2882944]

Game 2 is 5 turns in and the British are getting pushed around.

	<body>Set this game up on Sunday night, and got in maybe one or two turns.  Finished the game last night.  

Setting up the game was a beast, as expected.  There are a LOT of tiles, tokens, and cards to prep before getting into the meat of the game.  I won&#039;t say it&#039;s the most tedious game I&#039;ve had to set up (I&#039;m looking at you, Rampage), but it does take some time.  It can also take up quite a bit of table space, but again there are worse (*turns gaze to [thing=136440]Canterbury[/thing]*).

I choose Lucy, Bruce, and Bunny as my heroes this time.  Lucy and Bruce are my staples, and while the third character is usually chosen at random.  Really, the only character I feel is truly necessary if you want to have a chance at winning is Lucy (because of her ability to input multiple key code discs and improve search results).  The game started by immediately spawning two hoards right next to the start tile, blocking off access to the two doors to the east (2-direction) and the door to the north (1-direction).  I had the group all run off to the west and start working on looking for items to start unlocking doors.  

[center][ImageID=2883036 medium][/center]
[i][center][size=7]End of game, but shows the house as a whole[/size][/center][/i]

I was able to keep running around and avoiding the hoards for a while, forcing only one lock before placing all the code discs into the computer (thank you, Lucy!).  Throughout the game, I kept all the characters together as much a possible.  Bruce kept trailing hoards thinned, Bunny would occasionally drop behind to do some serious damage with her chainsaw, and Lucy would flip back and forth between her trusty baseball bat (something I feel should NEVER be dropped) and the shotgun, keeping the path forward clear.  We never encountered a creature, but some botched search rolls did keep those zombies right on top of me.  

Once the lab door was open, the team bolted for the antidote.  Bunny grabbed it and was confronted by Mortimer&#039;s daughter, the pyrokenetic (the name escapes me at present).  The characters were well equipped with grenades, machine guns, shotguns, and chainsaws, so they unloaded.  The nemesis was taken from 15 cubes to 5, but we soon ran out of actions and she got her activation.  After what was thankfully a poor roll on her part, she bolted and made it more than half way to one of the corner rooms.  Once the hoards had moved, I assessed the board and made an extremely poor decision: I rushed the group out of the door and as close to the nemesis as I could get them, then unloaded with ranged weapons.  Only managed to knock off two more cubes.  She ran to the corner room.  Then the hoards moved...right on top of us.

Up to this point, I had only rolled one bite and one entrapment on the zombie attack dice.  The thought never occurred to me that this might happen....
[center]
[ImageID=2883037 medium][/center]
[i][size=7][center]Yes...4 entrapment rolled, only one negated[/center][/size]
[size=7][center]With 3 survivors...well...not good.[/center][/size][/i]

So, they were swarmed and overwhelmed by zombies: all three characters entrapped on the same roll.  And this, unfortunately, means I lost.  I started off feeling pretty good about this session, thinking I was finally going to win the day, but one [i]really[/i] bad idea and one [i]EXTREMELY[/i] unlucky die roll put the kibosh to that plan.

	<body>I haven&#039;t played this in a month or so. I scored a 20! Not too bad for a little rust. And I made it a point to not buy the Cottage. I had been relying on that and on the Visitor card glut that that gives you to score VP with the visitors. I got some pretty useless (to me and my situation) visitors, but was able to use the entertainer to dump them for 3 VP. Nice. Filled 2 orders for 10 points, got another 2 I think with the Noble and scrounged a few others with the bonus space and voila! a draw with Automa. Very satisfying puzzle. 

[b]Edit 2/11/16:[/b]
I got in another play last night and it was an exciting fist pumping win-but whispered because my wife was sleeping!

I got the Papa that gave me a free water tower. I avoided getting the cottage until the very last turn when I needed to do something with all my workers. However, I was sitting at 15 VP on the last turn and I had 2 orders I was able to fill. One was 3 VP, the other 4. So, I realized I could at least tie the game by using the bonus action token that I drew that round. I hoped to use the cottage effect to get more VP from blue visitors. Nothing. 

So, I went ahead and tied the game and looked at what else I could do...then I realized I hadn&#039;t played the Grande Worker! BOOM! 3 more points for the win! 23-20!  Woot!

Shhhhhhh  :snore:

	<body>Looking at the variants for this, there are several that show a lot of promise. Most of them are more creative than mine by a long shot and seem quite fun.

Tonight I got my first crack at one of them: [thread=1516678][/thread]. 

I&#039;m pretty sure I was playing right, but I had Commodore Fontaine (me) vs Elias the Prophet. I drew the Cybernetic faction. I stomped them! 63-44. Commodore Fontaine&#039;s movement ability is pretty powerful. I was able to be at the location of or moving to the location of inactive catastrophic events and had enough defense to stop them thanks to my cards and Luna&#039;s ability. Also, being forced to get the cybernetics meant I got the cards that help me clone other abilities as well as score points each time they&#039;re played. I also played that the Nano Hacker took points from the Shadow Conspiracy. That only amounted to 4 points, but still it was fun to do that.
Plus if you get 7 cybernetic operatives you get an additional 7 points! Yowza. 

This variant does try to make it tough on you by taking away all the high point cards, but I was able to run away with this one. I&#039;ll have to try a few more.  

[b]Edit 2/13/16:[/b]
I played the [article=21791687]19 card set up with 10 turns[/article]. I used Feint and drew Commodore Fontaine for the opposition. I lost 53(4?-I think I forgot to give a card from the offer on the last turn) to 48. If you can see it you can try to tally up my score from the image below. I kept my score a little better than theirs. I drew the Cybernetics faction and mission and was able to complete it (+7 VP). It was different than gaining points putting out all the fires, but I was only able to get one of the catastrophic events to 3 for the Shadow. I think you probably need at least 2 to try and win, because the Shadow will gobble them up.

I used the &quot;Shadow draws the highest VP card in the offer&quot; rule as well. Makes a difference for sure. Some of the lower VP cards actually cost a lot more, making it tougher on the player! I look forward to trying with other Architects, but I do think Commodore Fontaine is probably the easiest. It helps to be able to move around a lot and get your embassies established. 

[ImageID=2888310large]


[b]Edit 2/20/16:[/b]

I played the Shadow Conspiracy with the updated rules again this morning. I used one of the Booster Pack 1 architects, Aellae:

[ImageID=2897711large]

She has a powerful ability, but you can only use it twice. So, it made me primarily rely on basic game play strategies. Also, I chose the cybernetic mission/faction, since Aellae seems cybernetic-y. Her ability to grab 2 cybernetic operatives for free is very helpful. I was getting beat pretty badly the entire game, but was jumping around (thanks to the Sub-light captain card which is probably what saved me) and establishing embassies, and letting the Shadow Conspiracy stop problems in the Solar System. But because of the moon&#039;s key ability (generate 2 defense) and the basic deck&#039;s defense cards and 1 defense card (only!) I picked up several events, but I was able to grab 2 catastrophic events too. 

So, I felt like I was behind the whole game, but when I tallied up the points I won! 66-53. I had completed the mission for 7 points, had 5 embassies, and I was able to copy an operative&#039;s power and get 4 points on the last turn as well as complete a catastrophic event! Pretty big swing. I had several cards worth a good many points and had a deck with good card draw and good deck thinning. I got rid of 4 Material Assets and had a lot of money generation capabilities. 

It was quite fun! Here&#039;s the end game photo:

	<body>After the whooping I took in Thunderbolt Apache Leader [listitem=4445748]yesterday[/listitem], I decided I need to play something lighter.

Played my first game of Harbour. It&#039;s interesting. I&#039;m not sold on it as a solo experience yet, but I bet I&#039;ll enjoy playing it against my wife. It&#039;s certainly a neat little game. I honestly never thought I&#039;d enjoy a worker placement game that only has one worker, but there ya go. :P

[u]Final Score[/u]
The Wharfs: 37
Training Dummy: 29


:thumbsup: Neat little worker placement game, which is one of my favourite game mechanisms.
:thumbsup: Nice to see harbour being spelled right for once. :devil:
:thumbsup::thumbsup: The artwork keeps making me laugh!</body>

Yeah, I am really digging this.

Put together a match of--
[b][center]
Spidey, Iron Man, Angel, and Red Hulk
VS.
Mystique, Cyclops, Mister Sinister, and Magik.[/center][/b]

Spidey and Angel were quite the champions.

[IMG]http://orig09.deviantart.net/1922/f/2010/019/3/f/angel_by_clayton_henry_by_robsaint.jpg[/IMG]

Angel being able to field an extra sidekick, when he fielded, gave 1 extra point of attack and another opponent to block.

[IMG]http://www.writeups.org/img/inset/Mr_Sinister_h1.jpg[/IMG]

Mister Sinister&#039;s crew spent much of their time waiting to block a big Spidey attack. They blocked him once, but with no one in their field after that--

Final score: Spidey&#039;s 13, Mister Sinister: 0

I&#039;m considering trying an increase of starting life to 30 or 40, rather than 20. With 20 Life, the big heavy guys barely get a chance to fight before the game is already over. The 6 price, Iron Man never even got to go in the bag. Nor did the 6 price, Cyclops.

:thumbsup: Really enjoying the tactics in this game,
:thumbsup: A lot more thought involved in this cat &amp; mouse game, than I thought.</body>

	<body>Put some food on the stove and had to wait 20 minutes for it to be done, so I took out Tiny Epic Galaxies for a quick play.

Played two times on medium, won both times. Fast, a little bit tense (will the rogue galaxy roll energy and level up, again?), and controlled randomness by rerolling your own or the rogue&#039;s dice.

I&#039;ve played this game 9 times solo now and I enjoy it more and more! So much so that I even backed Tiny Epic Western against my resolution to stop buying so many games :blush:


I think I will try Imperial Settlers tonight...

[i]After eating a good meal which was put on the archaeologists&#039; tab at the Lion inn, and marveling over their wonderful new equipment (and also the scavenged equipment that they decided to clean up and use), the three heroes made their way back towards the graveyard on the edge of town.  (The archaeologists had declined to dine with them, claiming that they had overdue work to do at the tomb.)

&quot;I can&#039;t believe that there doesn&#039;t seem to be one decent blacksmith in town!&quot; Boudica complained.  &quot;I would prefer to enter a fight with a good blade in my hand rather than this fireplace poker! Still, it has served me well in battle so far.&quot;
[/i]


[b]The Darkness Track is at 2 AP from the last game.  Still using the Bones Darkness Deck, I set up a 12x12 tile with the quest: On Darkened Heels.  This quest requires the party to place 1 quest token (which may disappear during the Refresh Phase) on each side of the map tile except on the side from which the party enters, at the cost of adding 1 Threat to the hero who places the token.  Also each enemy figure gains +2 defense unless it is adjacent to a quest token. I set the Treasure limit to 6.  I have placed the required lair and hunting pack (Skeleton), plus an extra Arachnid lair just for fun!  
[/b]

[ImageID=2877415 large]

[i]There is a sombre, oppressive feeling overhanging this graveyard, only lightening at certain spots along the borders.  The heroes instinctively try to move along the edges of the graveyard area.
[/i]

This battle took a long time to clear the tile.  Although the Archer and Soldier took out the Arachnids and their lair pretty quickly (and no one was poisoned!), the Skeletons were much more difficult to defeat, spawning Captains, resurrecting, and doing damage to my heroes.  The Skeleton lair lasted a long while, and the +2 to enemy defense (a consequence of the quest conditions) had a big effect on the heroes&#039; ability to do damage, causing some complete misses!  Placing the quest tokens during the Refresh Phase was a nuisance because I kept rolling badly and the tokens would disappear again. :D  

The Acolyte managed to heal everyone in the party before the tile was cleared and they successfully completed the On Darkened Heels quest just as the Darkness track reached 6 AP again, gaining 3 Serendipity and 1 Green Item draw.  The Darkness Tested quest was added to the deck.

The heroes then used a Serendipity token to call the merchant, Talek Three Dunes.  They then traded in some unwanted stuff and spent some of the gold pieces that they had gathered to buy some more equipment and potions.  

The Soldier, who had finally found a sword to replace her rusty fire iron, bought an axe and gave her long-wished-for sword to the Acolyte. :)

[b]Current tally:
4 Serendipity &amp; 5 Gold pieces; 
Archer: 2 Vitality potions, 1 Anti-Venom Potion, and 1 Crossbow, 1 Quiver, and 1 Helm, 1 Amulet of Courage; 
Soldier: 1 Vitality potion, 1 Major Vitality Potion, 1 Lucky Potion, 1 Shadow Potion, 1 Axe, 1 Round Shield, 1 Leather Armor, 1 Mythical Cloak; 
Acolyte: 1 Vitality potion, 1 Anti-Venom Potion, 1 Shadow Potion, 1 Focus potion, 1 Long Sword, 1 Hearthfire Necklace, 1 Circle of Dawn.
Treasure bag contents: 28 White, 15 Green, 1 Blue.
All heroes are healthy.  Archer has 1 Ammo readied.  Darkness Track is at 0 AP.
[/b]


[i]&quot;I didn&#039;t expect to find those giant bugs with the undead, but that was worth it!&quot; exclaimed Boudica, brushing at the bone dust and ichor in her fur.  &quot;Now I am equipped like a real mercenary soldier. Those troops who would not accept my kind will regret their loss.&quot;  

&quot;I&#039;m just glad to have enough coin to get a hot bath and a cold drink,&quot; Bahati said.

Bhavya nodded in agreement, &quot;And food and a soft bed. But with my new gear and my accomplishments fighting the undead and laying them to rest, I am hoping that the townspeople will accept me, now.&quot;
[/i]


===
[COLOR=#FF0000]February 7, 2016[/COLOR]
[i]The next day, the trio of heroes was leaving the inn when they were approached by a large group of people.  

&quot;Heroes!&quot; one of the men called out, &quot;We have heard that you have destroyed a nest of Crawlers, and we need you to help us!&quot;

Boudica, Bahati, and Bhavya were surrounded and forced to stop by the surging of the crowd.  

A woman explained, &quot;There is another nest in the woods near the grazing fields, and this one has a queen!  She takes our largest sheep to feed her young, who then swarm our fields, attacking anything that moves.  We have found her nest, but she killed three of our strongest fighters and the rest barely managed to escape with the wounded.  If you destroy the queen and her nest, we will pay you six gold pieces and you will also have our gratitude.&quot;

&quot;Why does everyone here seem to think our lives are only worth six gold pieces?&quot; grumbled Bahati the Archer.

&quot;Shhh!&quot; hissed Bhavya.  &quot;I would like to settle here, so be courteous!&quot;

&quot;It seems we are seen as the town&#039;s heroes, now,&quot; Boudica stated loudly, standing taller and jutting out her chin.  &quot;Shall we protect it?&quot;

Bahati and Bhavya exchanged an amused glance but didn&#039;t contradict her.  

&quot;Lead us to the nest,&quot; Boudica the Soldier told the crowd.

After walking across a wide field and avoiding sheep droppings, the trio was pointed towards a narrow path leading into the overgrown, closely wooded area.  Upon entering the shade of the trees, Bhavya realized that the group of townsfolk were crowded so tightly together at the trail&#039;s opening that any retreat would blocked.
[/i]

[b]Switched to the Terror with 1000 Legs Darkness Deck. Set Treasure limit to 5, and Darkness Track to 0.  

I set up a 6x6 tile with the Arachnid Boss, an Arachnid Lair with the initial spawn, and a small Hunting Pack of Crawlers.  
Quest:  Darkness Tested, where the heroes cannot leave the tile until it is completely cleared.  Failure to clear the tile results in the permanent loss of the heroes!)
[/b]

[ImageID=2879124 large]

At the start of the first Hero Cycle, all the heroes had to discard 2 cards (or become prone from the boss&#039; ability).  The Soldier and Acolyte moved into the 2 free spaces  adjacent  to the boss, and all three heroes tried to do as much damage as possible, but it was a slow start.  During the 1st Darkness Cycle, the Archer was webbed and poisoned and had to discard 3 Hero cards and use an Anti-Venom potion.  

The Heroes eventually destroyed the lair and the 1st stage of the Arachnid boss.  Although the destruction of the lair stopped the enemy from spawning, the Arachnid boss Queen&#039;s larvae turned into new Crawlers.  The heroes also still had to control their Threat levels and had no real control over Darkness Events occurring. Many potions and healing cards were used, and the heroes tried to gather any treasure while also attempting to destroy the 2nd (final) boss stage.  I decided to save the 4 Serendipity points in case a resurrection was needed (it wasn&#039;t).  

The boss&#039;s 2nd stage was difficult to destroy because the required Courage tests caused the heroes to sometimes miss completely, despite the Archer&#039;s Amulet of Courage and some Hero cards that helped booster their Courage rolls.  Luckily, the Arachnid boss rarely completed a Fate dice recipe!  Finally, the Archer destroyed the Arachnid boss during a Darkness Cycle by using the Interrupt card, Wayfarer&#039;s Ruse! The party gained a blue item draw (Destroyer&#039;s Vambrace) and each Hero chose to get the Light of Freedom Title (which can be applied in the next adventure).  Then it was a matter of collecting treasure and mopping up the rest of the minions.  

The party collected their 6 Gold pieces and dealt with a merchant, Tenebrae the Lightless, trading in some unwanted stuff to purchase the Dark Crystal for the Acolyte.  


[b]Tally after clearing tile and dealing with merchant, Tenebrae the Lightless:
4 Serendipity &amp; 2 Gold pieces; 
Archer: 1 Vitality potion, 1 Crossbow, 1 Quiver, and 1 Helm, 1 Amulet of Courage; 
Soldier: 1 Axe, 1 Round Shield, 1 Leather Armor, 1 Mythical Cloak; 
Acolyte: 1 Vitality potion, 1 Shadow Potion, 1 Long Sword, 1 Dark Crystal, 1 Circle of Dawn.
Not equipped:  Destroyer&#039;s Vambrace.
Treasure bag contents: 28 White, 15 Green, 1 Blue.
All heroes are healthy. Archer has 0 Ammo readied. Darkness Track is at 4 AP
[/b]

Since I decided that this is the last tile being played for this adventure, I tried to sell as much as possible to get really good stuff because my heroes can keep only 1 item (other than their Brown Starting items) to carry over to the next adventure.  But the potions were worth nothing, neither was the unused Serendipity, and the  items drawn for possible purchase were mostly inappropriate for the hero type or the hero already had something better.  I decided to have each hero keep an item that enhanced the main attack, so the Soldier took back the Long Sword, the Acolyte kept the new Dark Crystal, and the Archer kept the Crossbow.  The Destroyer&#039;s Vambrace blue item, as well as the other items that gave valuable buffs and advantages, had to be discarded. :(

To simulate, in my story, the rule that each hero can only keep 1 non-Starting item per Title when ending an adventure, I will have the adventurers gradually spend/lose/trade away all their other stuff during the &quot;off-stage&quot; period between adventures.  Heroes are also healed and all status effects are gone before the next adventure starts.

[i]
Exhausted and filthy, the heroes pushed their way through the crowd, Bahati the Archer demanding their payment.  After some of the townsfolk cautiously took a look into the Arachnid den and confirmed the heroes&#039; success in vanquishing the Arachnid Queen and her lair, people slowly started to ante up the money until the equivalent of 6 gold pieces was piled on the ground.  Bahati counted it and divided it between the heroes, having to first get Boudica&#039;s attention away from accepting only the vocal expressions of congratulations and gratitude.

Bhavya the Acolyte handed the longsword back to the Soldier and made her way into town to find a Merchant who had a certain crystal that she had been eyeing for while.  

Over the next few weeks, the trio lived well, and got a few free drinks for the telling (and exaggerating) of their adventures, but as their money ran out, they gradually started to sell and trade their possessions for food and shelter.  Even Bahati&#039;s fancy quiver was soon parted with...
[/i]

	<body>Last night I managed to beat Yog-Sothoth within 4 Mythos cards.  I played with two investigators - Withers and Anderson.

Mystery 1 - defeat Epic monster on Arkham
Withers starts there so I used his turn to level up a skill using his starting spell and then buy Holy water which I used to defeat the monster on the first turn.

Mystery 2 - get 2 clues and put them on the card
I had two clues on the map - both within reachable distance.  This took me 2 turns to complete with Withers and Anderson obtaining one each.

Mystery 3 - close a gate and put it on the card (by discarding 2 spells)
Withers had picked another two spells - one which enables him to encounter something without fighting monsters.  He did this with a gate in Buenos Aires and discarded two spells for the win!

Considering I&#039;ve had some games that seemingly go on forever, this was really short! I&#039;ve been looking at some expansions for this so I might add Forsaken Lore or Strange Remnants to the next order I make just to shake it up a little.

	<body>I am really enjoying playing through the Hour11 converted Warhammer skirmish scenarios.  I typically play them solo in preparation for introducing them to my gaming group. Sometimes the scenarios require some minor tweaking to smooth out game play.

Scenario: The Sentinel

Marcus Decimus (Q3+, C3, Leader), his second in command Juilus Secondus (Q3+, C3, Hero) and what remains of the 101st Legion (Q3, C2, Shooter Long X3) stand before the walled ruins of the ancient Dragon Kin temple. Their gaze is fixed upon the open gate and two crumbling sentinels made of stone, standing to either side. Simply passing through the gate and their long quest to locate and secure the powerful Firestone gem will finally be at an end. 
[ImageID=2881804 large]


Marcus Decimus leads the charge towards the open gate.
[ImageID=2881805 large]


The strong leadership of Decimus, holds the legion in formation before the terror of the suddenly animated sentinel charging before them.
[ImageID=2881806 large]


The Sentinel attacks with all its fury and uses its massive wings to flank the terrified legion.
[ImageID=2881807 large]


Decimus realizes his only hope is the safety of the open gate. He orders the legion to run for their lives.  The legion crashes into a magical barrier and are prevented from entering the gate.  The Sentinel charges towards the legion pinned against the wall.  Decimus loses all hope and flees in terror, with his troops quickly behind him.

	<body>This was my last play last night and I went right to bed after! I thought I had a fairly reasonable initial draw and could work things to my favor...wrong apparently. 

I never got the engine running. It coughed and sputtered and wheezed. I think there&#039;s a oil leak somewhere and it belches black smoke every so often. I never planted an additional field and I was always 1-2 fields behind. I managed a 15.15 thanks to some creative helper use and the ability to get some casual customers to pay out on the last round or so. Still. 

It got me thinking if I should have taken a loan early (I almost never do this). It would be fun to be able to go back and replay it, but with the variability in this game that&#039;s impossible. However, I did move 2 spaces on turn 1, which perhaps I should have avoided and just kept the 3 cash for other uses. I may need to make a habit of that.

Also, I will be playing again tonight in an attempt to redeem myself. 
[b]
Edit 2/10/16:[/b]

Round 2! 
That&#039;s better! It started off looking dire with no Regular customers in the initial offer, but I was very slow at my movement and one came up on the draw. So, I prepped for that one and slowly got the engine running. The Tenant Farmer&#039;s scrying ability was very helpful early on to do that. 
I continued to slowly get things running and got only 1 extra field, but it was enough! A timely $2 purchase of the Saleswoman at the end let me ignore the Regulars to fulfill two $11 cash Casuals and have the funds to finish at 17.9!  Whew!

[b]Edit 2/20/16:[/b]
Ah Saturday morning Loyang. It&#039;s beginning to be a very nice tradition for me with my coffee. However, I seem to absolutely do terribly at my first game! I scored a 15.1 (after loan). I got too aggressive early on by trying to get the Lima/Leek customer and keeping her happy totally bogged me down.
So, I set up again, and this time she came out just a little later and with that and several casuals and some big help from the Con Man (I love that card), I scored a 17.14! Much better. I can move on to the next game (Helionox of course!).

	<body>Got in a game of this last night.  I was playing with [u][thread=1055800]this[/thread][/u] variant, and boy howdy how do I hate my drunken brother!

The game is definitely a table hog (see image below), but it is nice to have all that room to spread the buildings out.  That, and if the tiles were any smaller, my large, oafish hands would start to get pretty annoyed with handling them.

In any event, I started out  with my usual back-to-back of levying funds followed by performing a full build. I try to make sure I have as many valid places to put my brother&#039;s buildings as possible, as I really tire of his promises becoming my problem.  The first couple nights he was too black out drunk to make any promises, which didn&#039;t hurt my feelings any.  Up until the first district scoring round he was either too drunk to do anything, or only put out wells and gardens (which was a blessing and an annoyance, because the end game score is based on the delta between his prestige and mine).  I still had a commanded a strong lead, but with the bigger buildings coming up the rounds started going much quicker.

He ended up unloading a couple towers and...stages? I can&#039;t quite remember what the one square culture markers are called...anyway, he started passing the buck on those and it cost me my hard earned prestige covering up his mistakes.  But then something happened.  He started to make good on his promises.  He was able to build everything he promised.  This was not ideal.  I much prefer him blacking out to building, again because of how the game is scored at the end.  I redoubled my efforts to get some large buildings out in the city and dominate the King&#039;s Favor board.

At the end of the final scoring, I ended up with 458 prestige, while my brother had 124 (his personal best, if I recall correctly).  With a delta of 334, I felt pretty good about how I managed my and my brother&#039;s affairs.  He did better than I would have liked, but at least he was pulling some weight, for once.  :p

	<body>I don&#039;t know what caused me to pull this game down from the shelf late last week. I had just finished playing Mage Knight and everything else either felt lamer or too complicated that I don&#039;t have the brainpower to learn (DDay at Omaha Beach, Navajo Wars, etc). Conflict of Heroes was an option but I am still playing the first mission and it&#039;s not a &quot;fun&quot; game, it&#039;s an extraordinarily interesting tactical game; I&#039;m at the stage of learning how to really use those core units effectively, and not the rules. That can be fun but it&#039;s a lot of work. I needed something more fun. 

Then I remembered this. I set up the 1806 campaign.

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/RhDES15.jpg[/IMG]

The game starts off in Oct 1806 with a battle in Jena. Boy, Napoleon sure didn&#039;t expect that!

Additionally, the campaign ends in failure if Dresden, Munich, and Berlin are not held at the end of Nov 1806. Warsaw needs to be held by the end of Dec 1806. My armies are going to have to march overtime. 

[b]Oct 1806:[/b] The Prussians have surprised my forces in Jena! I quickly leave Wurzberg to assist them. 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AT0i8qq.jpg[/IMG]

I survey the situation and decide to attempt a strong effort towards a cavalry sweep. I make my first attempt and..... hugely successful!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0QDy1D8.jpg[/IMG]

With Jena taken, I force march my troops into Leipzig and easily conquer it. Meanwhile, my main troops have moved into Bamburg and Pilsen. 

The enemy made some skirmish attacks but was quickly defeated. 

[b]Nov 1806[/b]

[i]Note: All arrows show how the troops moved during the prior turn, not where I plan on moving them [/i]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/8UmDTiD.jpg[/IMG]

With the Prussians weak and their attempts to rebuild an army taking time, I quickly advance into Dresden and Berlin. Attempting a raid was successful, netting me some much needed resources I desperately need. 

With an unbroken front, I feel confident enough to move many of my troops to the battle line, leaving weak forces to maintain my hold on the captured territories.

However, the long march to Warsaw is still ahead of me. 

[b]Dec 1806[/b]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XsgEWgt.jpg[/IMG]

MERDE! Where did all those damned Russians come from? Ah well, in for a centime, in for a franc. 

I marched my tired armies to Warsaw and quickly captured it, but those uncultured peasants immediately saw an opportunity and took it. 

Let&#039;s zoom in to Warsaw and see what&#039;s going on. 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/DdcOaVG.jpg[/IMG]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yJoZUom.jpg[/IMG]

Once again, a cavalry sweep is in order. A tough call to make with the severely limited available troops, but if successful will leave me with some much needed breathing room; something my tailor could also leave me with. 

[IMG]http://www.gianduiotto.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/1806-Napoleon.png[/IMG]

Attempt the sweep and a huge success! Eliminate 4 enemy troops and severely weaken one. 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/swXHE4c.jpg[/IMG]

The battle was slow moving and the Russians retreated back to Pultusk, severely weakened though mine own forces weren&#039;t untouched. 

I worry about my hold on Berlin as the lone force protecting it is vulnerable to the attacking Russians. I predict a large battle in Eylau before the winter ends, started by yours truly.

[b]February 1807[/b]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/zJbsfiX.jpg[/IMG]

To be continued.......

[size=18]*UPDATE*[/size]

I moved my troops into Eylau and wiped out the uppity Russians. I then had all my troops from Warsaw, still seething from the humiliating withdrawal, move North into Pultusk and reclaim their glory! The enemy could have advanced into Warsaw through Thorn and cut short a crucial supply line but the cowards holed up in Friedland, preparing their defenses for my imminent glory!

[b]June 1807[/b]: [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KxyI8mE.jpg[/IMG]

Friedland. The last bastion of rebels in French Prussia. I need this to secure the borders of my new acquisition. 

The battle begins:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XqaRGgO.jpg[/IMG]

Due to my cavalry heavy field army, I decide to go with the always reliable sweep. I wasn&#039;t able to implement it immediately and both armies slowly approached each other. I was wary of their static forces. 

However, eventually I managed to sweep the enemy, severely limiting their artillery. Simultaneously, I had my infantry and remaining cavalry charge into their ranks. While the enemy held strong against the shock, my brave forces decimated them in melee.

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/5917axs.jpg[/IMG]

Historical victory!

[size=18]Original Summary[/size]
I&#039;ve been playing this in the mornings, about one turn a morning. DVG has an excellent design model where they take a bunch of uninteresting simplified and abstract game mechanics (the economy, the campaign map, the battle map where you just move up and down) and combine them into something that just works amazingly well.

Due to the abstractness of all the puzzle pieces, you never feel overwhelmed. Yet, this is a campaign game through and through. You are always able to immediately see how your campaign is progressing (or not) quickly and can then focus on how to reshift your priorities without checking. You have to divvy up your army intelligently and spend your economy extremely carefully.... Those same resources used to recruit a new troop can also be used to move your armies one more space. The battles matter, you have to smartly fight them as there are so many variables as to what can happen. And which of those battles should Napoleon be a part of? And should you get insights and if so, which and how many? I mean, I desperately need supply points (so a Raid) but the enemy has such strong defences (so a cavalry sweep or engineers)! Or maybe one of the others? 

And yet, the game manages to include infantry/cavalry/artillery, line and column formation, fog of war, morale, a reasonably symmetrical AI opponent.....

The game is so much fun. I&#039;ve got an interest in history although I wouldn&#039;t even call myself a light casual armchair historian. This game gives me the feeling of carrying out a military campaign without the usual investment required in carrying out something like this (charts/exceptions/terrain/etc).

Thanks to all the great &quot;SoloPlaythrough&quot; in this thread I played the DemoKit with the Mission Ambulators...(last play with the demo December &#039;14)
.... and lost, the last obstacle &quot;Human Security Chief&quot; killed my Ork Decker...

[imageid=2884189]

Last year I canceled it from my wishlist, but now....?!?!
A lot of fun, even in this little Demo Box. 
Quick Setup, quick and easy gameplay, but hard to win..
... so after all, (I) should (I) by the full version?!?! </body>

	<body>  So last week I was perusing my local online classified ads and happened upon this gem for sale, opened but unplayed.  The timing couldn&#039;t have been worse as I had placed an online order for R.A.F. and Field Commander Alexander the day before and technically had blown my gaming budget for the month already.  Well technicalities be damned, it&#039;s not very often one comes across a used copy of this and what with the US dollar exchange being what it is a new copy shipped to me would easily be in the $600 range so it was not hard to &#039;convince&#039; myself I should grab this while I could. (I&#039;ve been coveting this game since it first showed up on my radar :devil:)   


  Long story short I now have this in my greedy little hands and I was quite happy to find everything inside was still sealed.  Then I opened up this other slightly thinner but huge box inside the actual gargantuan box, &quot;My god, it&#039;s full of mini&#039;s!&quot; came to mind.  Glancing quickly through the massive rulebook, I was thinking it was going to be an over-complicated mess but that was quickly alleviated when I realized there is a lot of illustrations and the last half of the book is stories that you may end up referring to during your game.  In fact I think you could probably get people up and running through the opening story in a matter of minutes.  


  I took it out for my first spin the next day after putting together the four starting survivor and White Lion minis.  The quality of the minis really impressed me, and overall assembly difficulty was not that high with all the build resources available online.  Another thing that struck me was the customization options with all the survivor minis included and different armor/weapon combinations one could choose when building them, it&#039;s a bit mind boggling.  The initial showdown seemed fairly simple, but as I got further into the game and it&#039;s phases I started to see the depth and scope of the whole thing (and i&#039;ve barely scratched the surface).   


  At it&#039;s heart you&#039;re building your little settlement up through the resources you harvest from the hunt, however just surviving another year can prove to be a challenge.  Each year you pick a quarry to hunt and set up their AI deck accordingingly (which is mostly random so no two hunts will be the same), then you have to try to actually find it during a hunt phase. If you live through that you get to the showdown phase and face off against the beasty and hopefully defeat it to get more resources.  After the showdown you head back to the settlement phase (bad stuff can still happen to you even at home) and decide how to spend those resources to bolster your little group.  Do you go all in making gear or do you try to advance your settlement?  


  After my first plays I got a bit of a D&amp;D vibe and I could see a DM loving this as it frees up all the players to just play while the game runs everything under the hood.  I&#039;ve enjoyed my early plays of this and i&#039;m looking forward to digging into this monster for years to come.         </body>

	<body>I think I&#039;ll keep playing this for a while. I never really liked Pandemic, but I really love this one. The art is not for everyone, at the beginning I really wasn&#039;t a fan of it, but it fits for this game and the series. After a while I got used to it and started to like it even. Maybe watching the series helped...


Played another game on easy. Three level 1 schemes, easy enough to defeat. In this game, you really need to plan your moves and work together, otherwise you might get a character stranded somewhere and use up most or all of his action points just to get him to a position where he can do something.

I like playing the game, it is a great puzzle to solve. Averting Disastors and trying to defeat the Hood&#039;s evil schemes is great. But I think this is one game that I&#039;m not keen on playing with friends. I can already imagine the lengthy discussions about everything with eventually one person planning the moves for everyone else. Granted, a problem all coops suffer from. I enjoy Pandemic Legacy and Burgle Bros with my gaming group, but I&#039;m not keen on bringing this one to the table for some reason.

But for solo play, very great game.

I don&#039;t want to spam the list with my session report of this game, but if anyone wants to read about the exciting adventures of the Tracy brothers, I hope you have a few minutes :) [listitem=4451798]Thunderbirds are go![/listitem]

[i]guarding the border[/i]


played this game a few times over the last weeks
(and thanks to the quick customer service of Academy Games i could even play with the awsome Slave Catcher Towers, that add a big amount of tactility and flavour to the game, in my opinion!) - 

but it was a series of losses ranging from rather brutal to really brutal. 

until today it suddenly seemed to go comparatively well - 
still i lost as many slaves as i was &quot;allowed to&quot; but i managed to get &quot;enough&quot; up into Canada and even opened up just the right amount of spaces on the plantations... 
- i was just about to lean back and feel the relief of a very narrow win, 
when suddenly i discovered that i had overlooked a cube in the plantations due to sloppy cube placing - so lost again...:(


here the final image of the game: 


[imageid=2884391 medium]

:thumbsup: i very much like these kinds of abstract games that feel enormously thematic when played.
:thumbsup: after the first few games i feared that the rather static set up implies a solution for the best starting moves but the changing abolitionist card display seems to counter that quite well.
:thumbsup: beautiful components

:thumbsdown: the wooden towers don´t come with the retail version

:thumbsup::thumbsdown: very thematic. in another post someone said, that even winning feels like losing in this game and i can at least imagine that very well! the visual difference between the number of slaves safe in Canada compared to the slaves lost is enough to make any victory feel stale. 
that goes into the game decisions as well: when do you spend your resources to improve your organisation (buy those annoying support tokens) instead of using it for immediate help - which would be needed all the time?

	<body>Finally my first game with Gate of Arkham extension.
&quot;Ashcan&quot; Pete, the drifter and his dog Duke, were facing Yog-Sothoth.
Pete completed the adventures one after another, time after time, but the doom track filled much quicker than he could cope with.
With only 6 elder signs, Yog Sothoth appeared and ate alive Pete, his dog, his allies, the adventure cards. Then Yog put a napkin around his...necks...and started devouring the rest of the world.

:thumbsup: GoA is even more thematic than the core game. The different places, the event cards are great touches.
:thumbsup: More non-obvious possibilities for each turn to optimize actions. Many choices made tougher by hidden information.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: The game felt very difficult and I lost quickly, but later I was relieved to see in the rules Yog Sothoth is rated &quot;insanely &quot; difficult.</body>

	<body>I also posted in the SoM page but I always make the reports for SGOYT, and today I have to say that is a long one :laugh:

Finally received this today, the best thing that could happen today. After playing it, all I can say is that it is just awesome.

[imageid=2884415]

[i]The forces of darkness are gathering in the realm and the avatars are invoked to fight this new evil that is trying to rise Xulthûl and begin a period of darkness.

The adventure starts and our avatars, a red Blood Singer, called Echo and a green Path Finder, called Wolf, begin their journey. First they want to talk to the Mystic as she might have some answers and by looking at the map she’s not far. When they arrive at his hut in the wilds, she gives one quest to each hero. Echo has to retrieve in the desert a violet sun crystal and Wolf has to gather a pincer from a sectoid in perfect condition. Both ingredients are necessary to gain enough power to defeat the forces Xulthûl, so said the Mystic.

Reviewing some beast habits papers at her hut, they discover that the sectoids like to live mostly in the desert, so both decide to band as their quests directs them to same place, the mighty desert of Xalil, at the southern end of the realm.

They begin their long journey to the south, traversing wilds and forests, as the shadows grow stronger in their realm. In a local village near the coast of the lake they hear rumours of a nasty creature guarding a treasure, and they decide to investigate as is on their way, as they could find something useful. When our avatars reach the cave in the forest they find a small but fierce protean, some kind of fungus that the shadows touched recently, so the heroes decided to exterminate it before it grew stronger. The small protean proved more of a challenge than they thought and our (green hero) got wounded, but they managed to finish the beast and open the treasure chest to find the long lost Silver Sword of Slicing, who knows how it got there in the first place…

After this stop, our avatars decide to follow their journey to the south, but that night something happen and Echo gets trapped between time and space during his dreams. But Wolf doesn’t let him down, and he takes him with him to the hills, where the power of the sun and stars is stronger and Echo manages to return to Aethos safe and sound. While the sun rises, they continue their journey and they find a Cloak of Defense lying on some rocks, who knows who left it there, someone that wanted to help the avatars in their dangerous quest or if it was just pure coincidence, but definitely it will prove useful in they coming tasks.

The avatars mange to finally reach the desert, and while searching without success for the violet sun crystal they stumble upon a fierce sectoid. He is a young specimen but the black scorpions are known to be very dangeorus. The heroes need one of those pincer and they decide to face the foe. The black scorpion knows how to find flaws in our heroes movements and it decides to target Echo, confusing him so he doesn’t know that his friend is there to help him in combat, and he charges alone to this beast. He decides to drink his brew of the beast to face him, once he feels the power of the potion he charges against the beast and strike it in one mighty blow, but unluckily  destroying the pincer they needed. So they decide to keep looking in the desert, but they feel that some evil presence has entered Aethos, and they know they are running out of time.

The research proved to be more difficult than anticipated, and while they keep looking, a shadow starts moving in Aethos. But suddenly, when the avatars thought they were lost, Echo trips on a violet sun crystal, what a lucky find! But still no sign of any sectoid, so they decide to part ways, Echo tries to rush to the mystic while the Wolf keeps looking for the beast. That night before leaving a white owl delivered a message saying that one shadow was approaching one of the strongholds.

Echo flies like the wind, almost making it before dawn to the hut. And finally, a sectoid decides to attack the wandering Wolf in the desert, trying to avenge its fallen friend 3 days ago. This time, the black scorpion proves to be less fierce, killing it with one strike. Wolf decides to spend one his soul shards to try and take one of the pincers of the beast, succeeding at its quest. 

But another shadow enters the realm, and suddenly the sun turns black, the avatars know what this means, the light well has been taken by the shadows, and Xulthûl is awaken and Aethos has fallen to darkness and despair, and the avatars know they have failed Aethos.[/i]

Final thoughts:

I love books, because they play with my imagination, and this touches the same buttons. And after this first game, where I didn&#039;t even know what to do exactly, is the best adventure experience I had with a boardgame. It might not have the prettiest art or the best design, and you roll a lot of dices, for everything. But it just works, at what it does is the best I&#039;ve played, at creating an epic story with very little and the whole lot of what your imagination can do. Definitely get ahold of one copy if you like RPG/adventure kind of games, you won&#039;t regret it. I can&#039;t wait to put it on the table again (so many great games this month and so little time :laugh:)

:thumbsup: Great components
:thumbsup: Beast generator
:thumbsup: Creates a great epic story
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Lots of dice rolling</body>

	<body>For the [thread=1514134][/thread] Feb 2016 competition

[size=18][b]Party[/b][/size]
[b]Og the Fighter[/b]: he&#039;s got plenty of scars now, has learned a lesson about treasure chests, and his party has learned to not stand too close to him in dangerous situations.
[b]Quick Fingers Quin the Rogue[/b]: Don&#039;t trust him if you can&#039;t see him, he can be a dangerous opponent. And apparently fine with others making their own mistakes.
[b]Old Man Vizard the Wizard[/b]: Adept at magic, though forgetful of his studies at times.
[b]Burt the Cleric[/b]: A supposedly devout man that enjoys watching his friends get beat up, but apparently not so much that he&#039;ll walk with them to their deaths underground.

[size=18][b]The Delve[/b][/size]
[b]Preliminary[/b]
The band had spent some time together in the past and upon hearing the mayor&#039;s call for adventurers all had their own reason for reaching out to the others, meeting up, and heading down.  Some know little else besides battle. Others needed some good PR.  One needed to test some new arcane theories. Luckily one of them went to keep the rest alive. The mayor doesn&#039;t want to be feeding the Dragon, that would only make the problem worse.  Or was he? It sounded like many adventurers were headed down below...

[b]Room 1[/b]
Their quest started off well with Vizard lighting the orcs on fire and then Quin and Og trading blows to put them down quickly thereafter.

[b]Room 2[/b]
With Vizard&#039;s morning training still fresh in his mind he quickly brought his studies to bear against some kobolds they saw ahead, sending electricity zipping about between the lot of them and dropping all of them at once.

[b]Room 3[/b]
As they were congratulating Vizard on his new spells they were descended upon by a band of spiders and their hungry mother.  Even though Vizard was getting up there in years he still had enough reflexes to send off another lightning spell that caught all the spiders and quickly dropped them all to the ground twitching.

[b]Room 4[/b]
Delving deeper into the underground they found what the spiders had been guarding, a good sized treasure chest.  Og, getting bored with the lack of need for his blade, and not having great speed of wit, walked up to the chest and threw it open.  A large crack and a flash of light left all momentarily stunned.  Quin only snickered (luckily for his own health he was out of earshot of Og), as he had noticed something amiss about the chest but figured it would be more entertaining to watch the situation unfold without his input. As the foul smelling green cloud dissipate the troupe found Vizard lying motionless on the floor. That would not help their quest. Apparently Og&#039;s reflexes were faster than they thought. As a magical bold flew out at him he had grabbed the only thing in reach to protect himself with - the wizard. Unfortunately that left Vizard dead and any treasure the chest had contained was smashed to pieces. But a quest was a quest and the continued on while Burt set to communing with his god for forgiveness and salvation for the unlucky lot.

[b]Room 5[/b]
As the looked deeper for the dragon that was rumored to lair below the cake began to shake. A deep ravine could be seen at the edge of their torchlight that soon revealed a large cave giant scaling from below.  Og and Quin took the front guard as Burt prayed more fervently over Vizard. The giant took blows from Og and slices from Quin, giving his own blows to Og - his reflexes apparently slowed as he realized what he had done. Divine judgement was passed on Vizard and he was allowed to return to the mortal realm. It seemed the gods deemed their mission worthy, bestowing restorative energies on the whole party, which was lucky for Og as he continued to take a pounding from the giant that loomed over them. Quin and Og continued their tandem attacks until Quin finally found his opening, scaled the giant, and sank his blade deep into the giants eye, hoping off just in time as the giant toppled back into the ravine.

[b]Room 6[/b]
As they set to looking for the dragon again they learned they must be getting close. A hoard of past adventurers stood before them, blocking their path. They were long since dead now only bones and armor, but they stood at the ready. Knowing their mission the adventurers set to the task. But the soon realized these were tougher opponents than they looked. It took time as Quin and Og slowly took them down one by one and took about as many attacks themselves. Burt managed to call down another favor for them, causing Quin&#039;s and Og&#039;s wounds to close for a time. With only two left and the end in sight Vizard finally had his wits about him and recalled the incantation of lightning to send the old warriors to their rest.  Quin and Og heaved to catch their breath from the long fight and just looked at Vizard, wondering what took so long.

[b]Room 7[/b]
But there was no time for debating the matter, there was a roar from only a little deeper, the roar of a dragon.  With a nod between the two warriors they hustled in, ready to attempt protecting the other pair.  They fought well together both landing blows and then Og distracting the dragon while Quin drove his blade between the dragon&#039;s scales. The dragon let out his rage on Og, severely wounding him. But Quin was quick and the dragon too focused on Og. Their plan had worked. Quin sank his blade once more deep into the dragon from below, working it well between the scale.  Just before catching Og in its powerful jaws the dragon crashed to the floor, dead.

[b]End[/b]
The party had survived.  Now all they had to do was drag the dragon back to the surface to prove it...

[size=18][b]Thoughts[/b][/size]
A fun game. I get the feeling as you are rolling the dice the party is testing out the enemies, trying to land blows, create openings, and work out a battle plan.  Finalizing the dice is the party finally getting in sync and landing a good blow that the others helped open up by attempting attacks and faking strikes.
Looking into this game I found out about the Advanced version and am curious if it will ever fully return as not knowing the order of the rooms as well as having other character options could help make this more replayable. Either way I&#039;ll have to return to this game now and then.</body>

1st Attempt: ([BGCOLOR=#0000FF]BLUE TEAM[/BGCOLOR]) Played the Summer scenario on the easiest side of the board.  Climber #1 made it to the summit (10vp) and back down to safety, while Climber #2 reached 7000 meters (6vp).  No one died thank goodness.  Total = 16 points/Alpinist.   

[NOTE: I was missing one RISK TOKEN from my purchased &quot;used&quot; copy, so I used colored blocks from a draw bag instead with RED = 2; YELLOW = 1; WHITE = 0.]

[imageid=2886656 large]

2nd Attempt: ([BGCOLOR=#FFFF00]YELLOW TEAM[/BGCOLOR]) 11 points/Hiker (Climber #1 summited; Climber #2 made it to 7000 meters and ran out of acclimation points with two turns remaining.)</body>

Some more Marvel action. Decided on the X-Men with Cyclops, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Rogue, and Wolverine....

and then the random generator chose:

[IMG]http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/4/42/Sinister.png[/IMG]

So, it looks like Mr. Sinister wanted some revenge from last night.

He was attempting to unleash the Power of the Cosmic Cube.

I believe it looked something like this.
He had the Marauders, the 4-Horsemen, and the Doombots to help...

But this grouping of the X-Men were pretty hardy once they got going.

[IMG]http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2013/07/xmenorigins-wolverine.jpg[/IMG]

At one point they had a total battle score of 16!
That pretty much did the Sinister in.

	<body>Boy, adding plays to this list is slowly becoming like crack.  I apparently can&#039;t get enough, and it can become an expensive habit. :p

Anyway, I got in a play of SotRP (and I will gladly take credit for being the first to do that with the name of the game) tonight. I didn&#039;t score the greatest, 154, but I think a lot of that was because I set myself up for a water shortage in the first half of the game.  I was too focused on getting more worker/animals, and used a spirit card to do so.  Being second in line for water...sucks.  Hardcore.  If I got 1-2 tokens in the first three rounds it was miraculous.  

The second half the game went much better, but I still did a poor job managing water and had a LOT of empty fields come round seven.  Ah well.

[center][ImageID=2884687 medium][/center]
[center][i][size=7]My paddy at the end of the game...the water marks where I last harvested.
So much wasted opportunity...[/size][/i][/center]

As an amusing aside: I was playing this game around Christmas time and my wife, who will play games but doesn&#039;t go out of her way to do so, showed some interest in what I was doing, if only to be polite.  I started to explain to her what the game was about (being a rice farmer, managing water, yadda yadda yadda), when I turned over the AI spirit card.  It added weeds to all my planted/grown fields, which was unfortunate because that was ALL my fields.  The scene played out thusly - 

Me: (finishing turn explanation) &quot;And...my opponent is a dill weed&quot;
Her: (Stares blankly for a moment) &quot;...Do you mean a literal dill weed? The plant?&quot;
Me: &quot;No...I meant it in the figurative sense.&quot;
Her: (Laughing) &quot;Well, what does it say about you and your games that I could actually think you were playing against a weed?&quot;

Still won&#039;t let me live it down...</body>

	<body>Ok, so this isn&#039;t the most obvious game to play solo, but the game happened to be out of the game cupboard yesterday (my kids had been playing it during the day) and I figured I&#039;d see if I couldn&#039;t work out some way to play it solo.

So, what I came up with was a speed challenge: Set up as for a standard game (3 cards face-up with draw deck next to them; you take 6 dice of a colour).  Roll the dice as fast as possible, using usual rules to assign dice to cards and re-rolling the un-locked ones - or taking ALL dice back - trying to match the requirements of each card.

I wondered how many I could complete within 5 minutes.  As it turns out, all but 2!  So there was a challenge straight away - can you complete EVERY card in 5 minutes?

That seemed like it might be winnable a little too easily, so I also tried out a 4 minute time-limit.  First time, I had 8 cards left unclaimed, second time, 11 cards.  So 4 minutes seems like a pretty decent challenge, and I&#039;m not sure you could get all 30 cards done in that time.  But it makes it interesting nonetheless.

For info, I was claiming an average of roughly 5.8 cards per minute.  To get all 30 within 5 minutes, I&#039;d have to get that up to at least 6 per minute.  To do it within 4 minutes, I&#039;d need to be getting 7.5 cards per minute, which would require VERY good dice rolls most of the time, so perhaps a 4 minute time limit is TOO hard.  I think I&#039;ll go for trying to complete the lot in 5 minutes first. :)

Was a fun little diversion, and for a quick 5 minute challenge, I think it works just fine.</body>

	<body>With the first session reports (and some rules questions) appearing in the game&#039;s forum, I was tempted to dive again in the troubled Pacific waters. The components are still the pnp I did from the playtest files[i] (the submarine playmat isn&#039;t part of the game&#039;s components) [/i]while I&#039;m waiting for a proper copy to reach my doorsteps.

[imageid=2885303large]

I&#039;ve been playing [gameid=113873] a lot. I discovered the submarine warfare and learned so many things on the subject through books I read. Then, I got an overdose of dice rolls and charts checking (and probably spent too much time drawing the huge board) and hardly played it again. However, despite not being played anymore, this game will stay very dear to my heart for all I learned about submarines thanks to it.

Fighting in a new territory, with similar procedures but a new approach, is very pleasant. The procedures are similar to the previous opus, sometimes slightly more complex according to circumstances, because of the density of Dice Roll Modifiers and enemy ships, but the story is different enough to worth a second game. 
The designer added a lot of chrome and historical patrols to compete with and that&#039;s super challenging and interesting. 
I like playing it, so far. I may even go back to my &#039;first submarine love affair&#039;, the Hunters, later on.</body>

	<body>Been a slow month for me for some reason. Quick games have been more in order and maybe the FA CUP and new found interest in Premier League and taken up some of my leisure time but the games keep calling. Baseball Highlights has really hit a nice spot for me with lots of those games logged.

Now on to FLEET.

I purchased the base off of an auction, but couldn&#039;t play that solo. Hmmm... found a cheap kit that I thought would fix that but it was not the solo stuff when it arrived, broke down and bought Artic Bounty and am the proud owner of a complete FLEET collection. So... let&#039;s get started.

I hate having 4 different books to look through to read up on the cards and then the solo rules play like 2 player (refer to 2 player) but then use 3 player set up (find that) and oh yeah--- this is the rule that I just discovered. If you don&#039;t buy a License you get to draw two cards. I just overlooked it as I was too busy figuring out how the 2 player rules and 3 player set up took place. Flipping- switching books, what the heck are dock cards and bay cards- where do the licenses say premium or standard....  I wish they just had a solo section and walked through start to finish. So having never done that it was obvious now to me why I was losing so badly... those two cards would have been extremely helpful in launching boats or captaining ships or countering bids in upcoming auctions. Needless to say I think after these plays I have most of it figured out and am stepping up to adding some bay and dock cards.

The rule issue has been addressed in a file I found here that combines all of the rules into one glorious PDF. Amazing work... truly.

Now that my initial complaining is over lot me talk about the game itself.

It is a challenging bit of fun. San Juan-Race for the Galaxy- in that the cards have multiple multiple uses but the feel is better. In SJ and RFTG the cards are discarded to pay for things but in fleet the cards have different values on them. some are worth three coins and some are worth 2 coins or one and this is a brilliant addition to a multi-use card game. Do I spend my 3 card at auction or 3 of my 1 cards. It really made the decisions much more interesting than just discarding a number of cards in hand. Can I launch this boat instead during launch phase instead of using it to buy a license. 

The captains are tricky little buggers and they get very strong quickly which becomes a race and after watching years of Deadliest Catch I realize it is a race to catch as much as you can as fast as you can on your quotas to maximize profit. 

AVA- created a really nice randomizer tool for this gaem to that you can get to from [thread=1512575]FLEET RANDOMIZER[/thread]

Anyway looking forward to setting up and playing a more balanced fair game as I will not overlook drawing two cards when I don&#039;t pick up a license.

:thumbsdown: rules bounce from book to book
:thumbsdown: dock, bay, premium and standard cards are not clearly marked, must refer to rule book
:thumbsup: really fun challenging game once you figure everything out</body>

	<body>USPS notified me that a package had been delivered so I went home for my lunch &quot;hour&quot;.  

First impressions.  High quality instruction manual.  Plenty of bits.  And the tiniest meeples I&#039;ve ever laid eyes upon. 

[imageid=2885633 medium]

That&#039;s Agricola wheat for scale, folks. 

I look forward to finishing this entry when I have a chance to play the game.

Update: We (me, myself, and I) finally played. Usually I play a two-player game when learning the rules, but dove right into the solo play for this learning game. Let me tell tell you, this is a lot tougher that it first appeared to me. Its pretty much like any worker placement/resource management game. You don&#039;t have enough workers or resources to accomplish your goals.  And I like that.  It forces you to make concessions. 

[imageid=2888157 medium]

In the end I scored 12. Clearly, there is room for improvement.  It would have been smart of me to read how end game scoring works before I got to the end of the game as I lost 47 points to unfinished buildings and crusades. 

This is certainly a beat-your-high score solo game.  So some may not care for that.  But accomplishing the crusades, battling Vikings, and combating the darkness throughout the game made me feel like I had an opponent Also, the game comes with solo missions with victory conditions which will add some nice variety once I figure how to collect enough resources to build buildings without losing everyone in my parish to the darkness and Vikings.

I don&#039;t have any gameplay complaints yet, but I&#039;m still working out the rules. Speaking of which, the instruction manual is very well written. It might also be the highest quality instruction manual I own.

I assume he was a backer, as he said all he had to do was cut up the tokens (how I miss those micro-game days!), but I experienced rare remorse that I missed the KS campaign.

I went looking to purchase it and found that it&#039;s currently not available, but a trawl through the KS updates turfed up the PnP files (post 25 onwards), so I crafted my own copy and made a direct offer to pay the designer anyways.

Meanwhile this is proving a fine little (nano) diversion if you can get hold of it, or are up for a little light crafting.

	<body>Note: repost of a comment to another entry in this geeklist. ^_^



I played this again just last night, and I&#039;m very pleased I kickstarted this game. Initially I was feeling let down because of mixed reviews so I started taking a more critical focus with my plays, to see where and how the game breaks down.

So here are the major mechanisms in the game and my judgement of them: 

- First, the spirit cards. Cards are drafted, and there is a definite power range. The lower the priority number on the card, the weaker its special power is. The higher the priority number, the stronger the power. Every card is vastly different from the rest, which means that which card you pick will drastically change your game. 

- Second, the priority mechanism. As you play your spirit cards, you will be hamstrung by the highest priority number amongst all your cards played. The higher the priority number, the less likely you&#039;ll go first compared to the solo opponent. And if you play your strongest card first, be prepared for three rounds of pain as you wait despondently for the AI to release water for your fields. Sometimes the sacrifice is worth it. Sometimes it&#039;s not!

- Third, the water and rice growth cycle. Water is vital for growth, but water also blocks certain actions, thus you need to set up a paddy structure that reuses water as much as possible. Drain water from a paddy to harvest it or weed/de-pest it, and make sure that water goes into another paddy and fills it so you conserve that water. Having small paddies at the top to gather water to flow in late game to much larger paddies is vital. Understanding how water flows from the opponent to you if you go second is vital. Not understanding this will lead to pain. 

- Fourth, workers are allocated at different rates for different jobs. This can be confusing but the rubric on the board works fairly well. Basically, whenever animal workers are involved, you need one per thing you are removing (rock or pest) no matter the size of the paddy. Whenever people workers are involved, you need X people per hex of the paddy to work it, which is shown on the board. 

- Fifth, rice is both your points and your currency. The market can get expensive when buying more workers, because every item past the first invokes a heavy tax. Balancing this dynamic out with your future plans is vital. 

- Sixth, achievements are very, very important to take. They&#039;re mini goals with an attached reward of rice. You want to be able to start claiming them as soon as possible, as you can only claim one per round. 

Where this game breaks is when you make a mistake in judging card priority versus card powers versus water allocation. Sometimes you want to go first, especially early game. But as the opponent accumulates enough water to overflow, making you less dependent on its water-out number, going second becomes interesting. 

It&#039;s not a forgiving game. Screw up, and your fields will be dry, and the game won&#039;t be fun. Especially since luck plays a part in this, being conservative pays off more than not. And knowing how spirit card powers affect all of the above is the key to scoring well. 

This can turn some people off. I quite like the game. It&#039;s very different from other farmer worker placement games!</body>

	<body>I recently found out about this and then happened across it at my FLGS so I snapped it up. Really neat little game, and I can already tell I&#039;ll getting the Abductor Packs sooner rather than later. First game against Arkayne came completely down to the wire. I wasn&#039;t making any headway, but got lucky and pulled the card that lets you grab a card for free if you concede (Media Coverage). Naturally I picked up &quot;All units get in there NOW&quot; and proceeded to plan out some ways to mitigate the big roll. Unfortunately, the Terror cards I drew next made me discard half of those left, and then next turn I had to burn through two in a row, completely screwing up my purchase plan  and leaving me with no time. Plus, the gold terror card made it so I couldn&#039;t purchase back zero cost cards! Anyway, I was able to save four hostages and eliminate the abductor with the help of An Empty Promise, but Arkayne had taken an extra hostage early--and killed three--so there was still one left with the 2nd in Command when I ran out of time. Really cool game, through! I would have never thought a theme like that could work.

	<body>I sleeved all my Onirim cards, and moved them to a new box with a new cover stickered on top of it. (I knew there was a use for all the deluxe LotR LCG expansion boxes!) 

Goodness, shuffling is so much more pleasant with sleeves! And since shuffling is about 25% of this game, that&#039;s a much needed change. ^_^

First was vanilla Onirim - with a win that went down to the wire. 

Then I started mixing in expansions: 

- Glyphs, book of steps lost and found, and mirrors. 10/12 doors found; defeat. 

- Dreamcatchers and towers. Tower superstructure created, but only 7/8 doors found; defeat. 

- Sphinx and extra dream types, crossroads. 7/8 doors again; defeat. 

For some reason I really enjoy losing at Onirim. I love it best when I win, but losing is ok, too. It&#039;s about the machinations. </body>

	<body>[b][u]So a little bit of a story before I comment on the game[/u][/b]...
I traded for this a about 3 weeks ago. On a Tuesday back in January my wife texted me I got it, and all I could think about at work was getting home to play it. Needless to say after getting home and getting blasted by work after-hours(was on-call that week) the most I could do was set it up.
I was at work the next day when I got a meeting invite from the Senior VP of IT which was odd, and so I accepted. In the meantime two of our directors got handed their walking papers. So I go to the meeting and get sat down from a dude in HR and the VP of IT who proceeded to tell me due to &quot;operational efficiency&quot; I was being let go. To cap it off it was immediate and I was escorted to clear my desk out and then out of the building which was humiliating because everyone in my row was staring at me. NO ONE KNEW this was happening, not even my boss who was asking me about work while I was cleaning out my desk...needless to say I had to tell her. I went home to tell my wife(who has Lupus and sees many specialists) who was helping my daughter(who has High Functioning Autism) that &quot;BOOM!&quot; no more job and insurance(which is friggen scary because the well being of the two people most important to me depend on it). Thankfully I aced an interview two days later and landed a 2 year contract doing IT stuff for Travel Centers of America making more money and NOT having to be on-call. They liked my skills enough that I will hopefully get hired on. Unfortunately my wife is having to deal with the US government(not the model of efficiency) to get her and my daughter on Medicare/Medicaid(they both are considered disabled). Sorry...just had to rant.
[b][u]So on to the game[/u][/b]
I played on easy(choose 5 easy missions) to get a hang of the game. I watched a few walk throughs, but figured I would try and get the mechanics down before moving to the harder stuff. I spent most of the early years testing/researching the tech I knew I was going to use so when the time came to complete the missions(even though they were easy) I could auto succeed and hopefully get all 5 done.
I was surprised to say I did it with a couuple of years to spare! I ended up completing: Sounding Rocket, Mars Survey, Lunar Survey, Man in Orbit and Artificial Satellite.
I have to say it was a blast! Speaking for myself, it is easy to get caught up in the hotness/newness and feel the pull to buy a game that gets raved or posted about a lot, then after getting caught up in the hype, find the game lacking/not to my taste. In this case the game(even after one play) is deserving of all the hype it gets.
As an aside the time between jobs has had some positive impact on my gaming: I re-played some stuff I had in the trade pile and pulled a a couple of games off of it(Imperial Settlers, Sentinels of the Multiverse) and a few former co-workers who are gamers stopped by to check up on me AND gave me a copy of Runebound 3rd edition! They were really upset(along with some other folks at work) that I got let go. </body>

	<body>Recently picked up the new over-sized villain card pack, plus the [thing=181683][/thing] and the [thing=181682][/thing]. I own everything released so far for this game except the brand new [thing=171965][/thing]. It all fits into these three boxes:

[imageid=2886618 large]

Played in the Celestial Tribunal environment.

[imageid=2886619 large]

The Celestial Tribunal is a travelling AI ship, created by an ancient race, that judges any races that it comes across and punishes them if it finds them wanting (sort of like Q from Star Trek).

Played against Chokepoint.

[imageid=2886620 large]

Chokepoint is able to manipulate and draw power from the hero&#039;s and environment&#039;s equipment. After drawing enough power, she can transform into a powerfully armoured version of herself.

With Chokepoint drawing the Celestial Tribunal towards Earth, three brave heroes stepped up to save the human race.

[imageid=2886622 large]

The Expatriette is an expert in guns and ammo and can quickly build into a powerful source of damage.

[imageid=2886624 large]

K.N.Y.F.E. is an expert in close combat, able to cause high damage and act several times a turn if the cards fall into place.

[imageid=2886625 large]

The Naturalist is able to switch from human to rhino, alligator and deer forms, each form with special damage and/or healing powers.

The heroes and Chokepoint volleyed damage back and forth throughout the strange alien ship. The Celestial Tribunal was unable to act much in the early game as Chokepoint kept using its technology to power up. Eventually the Tribunal began a trial, transporting another hero, The Scholar, from Earth. The race was on to defeat Chokepoint and redirect the Tribunal before The Scholar was found guilty and the Tribunal destroyed humanity.

[imageid=2886634 large]

The heroes managed a few rounds of serious damage. In spite of Chokepoint wiping out the Tribunals trial of The Scholar in order to heal and power up, the heroes managed to deal the knock-out blow.

[imageid=2886635 large]

[imageid=2886636 large]

Love this game, so much variety and such deep and interesting gameplay. So many possible combinations of heroes, villains, and environments that you never need to play the same game twice. I will be hopping on the brand new KS for the last expansion, and if the funds allow will be picking up the limited edition foil hero cards.</body>

	<body>[b]More Dice Masters![/b]

Really digging this game.

I got better at purchasing to get some heavy hitters in a lot quicker.
Lots of planning and preparation. Sabertooth&#039;s crew got some hits on the good guys. Then the good guys got a nice counter.

The bad guys: X-23, Sabert&#039;, Juggernaut, and Vision were working towards some evil, BUT!

[IMG]http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26782/494017-216079_101166_psylocke_super.jpg[/IMG]

Psylocke pulled a move entering the Field, forcing Sabertooth out.
This happened right at the optimal moment--

[IMG]http://orig12.deviantart.net/ed17/f/2012/228/d/b/avx_infinite___wolverine_vs_cyclops_by_reillybrown-d5bampx.jpg[/IMG]

With Wolverine, Cyclops, and Psylocke all attacking at once, and no one to block...The BAD GUYS got hammered for some 13+ points of damage.

Destroying Sabertooth&#039;s crew instantly!

	<body>Finally! I got myself 9 (!!!) class decks and decided to start that campaign with these dudes here:

[ImageID=2885680 large]

It took me longer than I thought it would to built cool decks for each of them. Well, lots of cards to read and pick from. So all I did was just reading and building decks. But it was a lot of fun!

:thumbsup: excited to get this one going with my party!
:thumbsdown: sleeved cards are too big to fit into that core box.

Edit:

[ImageID=2889360 large]

Finally send my party on an adventure.

I played two games and I was running out of time in the first one, and got beaten in the second try. I had terrible monsters crushing my heroes in the second try. Lovely! :D

I&#039;m going to send them out again in a few minutes! :arrrh:

Edit:

[ImageID=2889580 large]

Next two games with this party and again I am running out of time. Mh... So I changed my party to a complete gang of dwarves:

[ImageID=2889583 large]
[ImageID=2889585 large]

Aaaaand got beaten like never before. Mh... two of them died, so I stopped.

I must be playing something wrong and the dice hate me BUT I have already put together a new party:

[ImageID=2889589 large]

[ImageID=2889805 large]

Two more games, two more losses. Running out of time again because of horrible rolls. Kinda frustrating. That&#039;s it for today.</body>

	<body>Taking a little break from [geeklist=204532]My month with Liberty or Death[/geeklist] to try this guy out. Rules were so simple even [b]I[/b] didn&#039;t manage to screw anything up. Nice. I did play too fast the first try however and missed a whole bunch of little details. I also kept drawing the Prime Directive objectives right after the timed objectives which didn&#039;t help. Reset.

Second game went much smoother and I won pretty easily. This is fun, but it makes me wonder if something like Pandemic: The Cure would see more table time. I&#039;m not a Star Trek fan so the theme is pretty lost on me (though it&#039;s pretty thin regardless). The game itself isn&#039;t bad, though. Roll dice,  prioritize, allocate, etc. I might give it a few more tries and call it worth the 10-dollar Target clearance price.

It does look cool on the X-Wing mat, though.

	<body>A day later than planned, on the 11th of February, I gave Imperial Settlers a try. I saw a solo-playthrough on youtube so I think I did everything correctly. But I managed a score of 91, so I guess I did something wrong :)

Very interesting game, it can really flow. I need to learn the cards more so I know what I can expect better. Looking forward to playing more games solo and with friends!


I also played a hard game of Tiny Epic Galaxies, which I won :)</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing a bit of solitaire recently - lots of Onirim, a bit of Agricola - and quite a bit more non-solo (!). For some reason I haven&#039;t felt like posting. Perhaps I&#039;ll treat myself to a mini-con this week and annoy you some more.

Anyway, what has prompted me to burst into print this time is my first win against Friday at Level 4. AT. LAST.

Although I&#039;m pretty sure it was mainly luck, I was a tiny bit smarter in my choices all the way through: not just thinning the first time through, but picking up a couple of useful cards when I noticed the bulk of the good starting cards were still in the Robinson deck; being slightly more strategic about which yellow cards to let turn red; thinking a couple of moves ahead with the 3-peek and below-the-pile combos; using my exchanges in the correct order; and being patient with copy to pick up +2 food when possible/probable.

It helped that I had the easiest Pirates to beat: 7/25 and 8/30.

So, having beaten the game ;) I&#039;ll probably end up playing it more. Taking a year to get from Level 3 to Level 4 was becoming a bit of a monkey on my back. This win, together with an exceptional (for me) win/loss ratio on the beginner^W base game of Onirim has me almost ready to try to like Glass Road again.

Or I could just concentrate on getting Liberty or Death to the table. And Roads&amp;Boats&amp;Cetera. (Although the box for this latter actually is a table.) Or the whole damn Firefly &#039;verse.

We&#039;ll see. In the mean time: Good Riddance Robinson!</body>

	<body>After my last attempt resulted in defeat, it was time to take my card draw deck and attempt to save a wounded eagle!  For easy reference, my latest card draw deck and previous attempt at this quest can be found here - https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/202271/item/4376420#item4376420

As mentioned during the final thoughts of my last attempt, I wasn&#039;t holding out much hope of saving Wilyador.  I didn&#039;t have much ranged or Eagle cards in my deck - both of which are crucial to fighting many of the enemies in this quest.  My plan was to give it a proper try, now that I knew how the quest worked, and if I failed, I would move on to the next Expansion pack before coming back at a later time with a customised deck.  At least, that was the plan.

Things took a turn for the worse pretty quickly as I drew Eyes of the Forest (discard all Event player cards) and Exhaustion (deal 2 damage to exhausted characters) in turn 1.  Luckily, Eleanor was able to cancel one while A Test of Will dealt with the other.

Turn 2 saw another two Exhaustion cards hitting the staging area.  :shake:

Eleanor was able to cancel one but I couldn&#039;t do anything about the other.  This left both Eowyn and Eleanor near death while poor Bilbo, with his measly 2 health, wandered off for second breakfast in the discard pile.  The loss of Bilbo was a major blow to my card draw strategy and in hindsight, I probably shouldn&#039;t have risked him by questing with him.  With that said, who could have guessed that I would get hit by both Exhaustion cards in the same round!

After the dreadful luck of the first 2 rounds, I was due a bit of good fortune and Lady Luck duly delivered by offering up Athelas cards.  By round 3, all of the Athelas cards had hit the staging area (with one already having been captured by Gloin).

At this point, I had all the Athelas I needed to win the game.  I just needed to rush to Mission 3B while capturing the remaining Athelas.  The difficulty was really in how to capture the Athelas.  Capturing two more Athelas proved relatively easy as Eleanor and Beravor tend to exhaust on a situational basis.

The problem was that I needed all four Athelas to win (Wilyador having suffered major damage from Exhaustion and a Swarming Insects shadow card).  Eowyn was questing every round in order to make progress while Legolas was attacking every round to clear out enemies.

In the end, things came to a head in round 6.  Gandalf, arriving precisely when he meant to, gave me a massive boost to my questing ability.  This allowed Legolas to exhaust to grab the last Athelas before we cleared Mission 2B.

With all four Athelas (and massive thanks to Lady Luck for granting all four of them so quickly!), this chalks up another win for my card draw deck!

Final score - 124</body>

	<body>I completed my first Solo Conquest.  I&#039;m really getting a feel for the flow of the game.  In my case that flow involves sitting and thinking for about 10 minutes per turn trying to figure out how to play my hand!  In that way, it is very similar to one of my favorite games, [thing=62227][/thing], which has the same brain burning card play.

I randomly chose Norowas, with Goldyx as the Dummy.  I set out and had some early luck against a pair of Keeps.  The expanded hand limit from being near these helped give me enough power to take down a Mage Tower.  

On my first level up, I took the Training Advanced Action card, which I figured would be powerful to acquire that early in the game.  I paired that with some high Influence Advanced Actions cards later on, which allowed me to have 10 Advanced Actions by the end of the game and some pretty heavy hitting units.  The first core tile I explored held the White City, and the third held the Red City.  The keep on the doorstep of the White City really helped, because after taking this (my third) my hand limit was very high.  The White City fell on the second assault.

At this point, I figured I didn&#039;t have much of a chance to take the Red City, and even started to move toward other targets when my hand started to look very favorable.  I would need a black mana, which I didn&#039;t have, but got super lucky and rolled it when I needed it after using another of the dice to power up a move to get next to the Red City.  The Dummy was burning cards super fast, but I was able to launch an assault paired with the Spell Wings of Night, which allowed me to not worry about defending and unleash my Units hard on the defenders.  I took 3 of the 4 down on this assault.  The Dummy declared the end of the Round (and the game), but I had one last chance and assaulted the city on my final turn.  I needed 14 Attack to take down the last defender and came up with exactly 14 with my final card to win!  Final score: 140.

[i]Board at the end of the game.[/i]

Okay, I have to admit I&#039;m a little disappointed with this game, but I think that&#039;s really only due to super high expectations.  I would have thought it was a perfect fit for me and this play showed how much fun it can be...delivering fist pumps.  I think I was hoping this would be my new #1 (like I said, high expectations), but it is feeling more like around #5.  Maybe I should just look at it as, &quot;Wow, I found a new Top 5 game!!!!&quot;  :laugh:</body>

	<body>[listitem=3921700]Ryan plays Smokejumpers on his cool geeklist here.[/listitem]

[b]30 day fire season[/b]
Budget: $200,000

For this campaign I am using the new edition of Smokjumpers. I will be using the using all the advanced/optional rules, including the hose rules not included with previous versions. I&#039;ll also use a houserule to alter the transportation rules for initial attack (IA) squads (crews in game terms). Instead of needing engines to transport crews around the map, each IA squad will automatically have a vehicle assigned to them that will allow them to move at the road rate. Loading into and unloading from the vehicle will cost 1 MP each. This will significantly affect gameplay for situations that I use them in comparison to the official rules. Smokejumpers will not have access to vehicles.

[u]Day 1: Gusty day[/u]
A fire was reported in the timber. Four smokejumper squads jumped it and aggressively attacked the head and flanks of the fire. A CL-215 skimmer dropped it&#039;s entire load at the head of the fire. An increase in wind speed or a change in direction would push the fire over their lines. Fortunately neither occurred and they made short work of this fire.

Fire size: 1 hex
Resources used: 4x smokejumpers, 1x transport, 1x skimmer
Budget expended: $9,000
Budget remaining: $191,000
Outcome: [BGCOLOR=#009900]Success - (Fire Controlled)[/BGCOLOR] 

[u]Day 2: Average Day[/u]
At 1800 a new fire start was reported. The fire conditions were moderate today and by the time the fire was detected the humidity was already trending down for the day. The four smokejumper squads were overkill for the fire size and conditions, but at least it was contained and controlled quickly.

Fire size: 1 hex
Resources used: 4x smokejumpers, 1x transport
Budget expended: $5,000
Budget remaining: $186,000
Outcome: [BGCOLOR=#009900]Success - (Fire Controlled)[/BGCOLOR] 

[u]Day 3: Average Day[/u]
Had four smokejumper squads on standby today but no fires were reported. They established shade on the tarmac and sat down in their folding chairs all day griping about not getting any hazard pay.

Fire size: N/A
Resources used: 4x smokejumpers
Budget expended: $4,000
Budget remaining: $182,000
Outcome: [BGCOLOR=#009900]No ignition.[/BGCOLOR] 

[u]Day 4: Average Day[/u]
Today the duty officer decided to only staff a couple smokejumper squads to free up some resources for other areas and save a few dollars. At 1300 a fire was reported about a quarter mile southwest of Clear Lake. The two squads jumped it and each made a close landing. With light winds out of the southwest the fire was pushing slowly toward the lake. Because the fire was moving slowly it was also growing in all directions. They didn&#039;t have the resources on hand to line and hold the fire across its entire perimeter so they decided to let it grow toward the lake and use that as a barrier. The jumpers spent the first four hours herding the fire toward the lake and strengthening their lines at the heal and along the flanks. Once the fire reached the lake the jumpers were able to take advantage of the rising evening humidity to transition from strengthening the line to mop up. By 2100 they had the fire controlled.

While this fire was not very active, it provided a bit of a challenge because I decided not to request additional resources. I was forced to direct the jumpers to move back to the heel and flanks of the fire a couple times to strengthen their lines when a wind shift or humidity decrease would have threatened weak spots in their line. Had the fire not been burning toward the lake I would have called for additional resources stop its growth earlier.

[u]Day 7: Thunderstorm[/u]
The weather service was predicting thunderstorms over the dispatch area today so the duty officers were staffing up in response. We had eight smokejumper squads in two transports and a CL-215 skimmer on available for immediate response if needed. The first call came at 1400. Light smoke, vertical column, with fire on the surface. We only dispatched one transport and four jumper squads, holding the others in reserve.

[u]Day 8: Thunderstorm[/u]
With a second day of thunderstorms in the forecast, we staffed with 4 smokejumpers and a helicopter. The initial report came in that a fire was burning with a south wind at its back north into a highway. The spread potential seemed low so the duty officer opted to hold the smokejumpers back and call for an engine and initial attack (IA) squad even though their response would be delayed an hour.

After this fire had been contained to two hexes, an aerial observer in a fixed wing spotted a new smoke column about half a mile to our south. The jumpers were called and the engine and IA squad drove as close as they could. The IA squad then began deploying hose south from the engine toward the new start. After landing the jumpers put some scratch line in on both flanks whie the helicopter made some bucket drops on the heel and at the head. The bucket drops would keep the fire from backing any further but we knew they wouldn&#039;t contain the head, though they would slow its advance. The fire ended up spreading two more hexes forward off the head but was contained with handline after that.

As the second fire was being mopped up a motorist reported seeing smoke about 3/4 of a mile to the east south of the highway. The aerial observer made another pass confirmed that it was penned between the highway to the north and the creek to the south. With the humidity rising as afternoon transitioned to evening, no additional resources were dispatched. The engine and IA squad were routed to the new start. Though their response was a bit delayed the fire didn&#039;t have the capacity to spread.

[u]Day 10: Dry Lightning[/u]

[floatleft][ImageID=2887661medium][/floatleft] After a busy three days we had another likely one ahead of us. Dry lightning was in the forecast. We staffed a bit heavier today with smokejumpers, an IA squad, an engine, and a skimmer on standby. We didn&#039;t have long to wait as the first call came in at 1300. The report came in that it was burning between a road and a creek with a wind out of the northwest at its back. So we held the jumpers back and sent in the IA squad and the engine. The IA squad had a busy few hours building check line. They used the skimmer to make a couple of water drops. The fire kept trying to flank as the water from the skimmer and hoselay slowly evaporated. Though the fire didn&#039;t get big the IA squad was busy working to contain the flanking activity.

While the first fire was being worked a second was reported a good distance to the northwest a ways from any road. The jumpers were dispatched. They made pretty short work of it. Just as everything was winding down and evening was wearing on a third fire was reported to the north adjacent to a home. The engine, IA squad, and skimmer were routed to this new start and managed to contain it to its origin hex. All resources en route home by 2100.

It was a busy day and fortunately we didn&#039;t have any high winds to deal with.

[b]Current status:[/b] So at this point I have 66% of the 30 season left and 70.5% of my budget remaining. So I&#039;m on pace to have a pretty tight finish at this point. I&#039;m hoping for some rainy days and easy average days because if I keep getting a more thunderstorm and dry lightning days I&#039;ll be eating up my budget faster than I want. 

[b]Update 14 February[/b]
So to address the challenge that the game can pose, today I lost the campaign on day 11. I rolled for yet again another Thunderstorm. Only this time my windspeeds increased both at 1200 and 1300. The fire was reported at 1300, in the grass, and burning directly toward a house. I only had 4 smokejumpers, 1 helicopter, 1 engine, and 1 IA squad that could respond on the first turn. They were split up in two adjacent hexes and were able to defend the structure by making a stand with water from the engine on the adjacent road space. Next to them a couple of smokejumper squads gathered to extend the hoselay one hex from the engine and put some wetline down to reinforce their road hex.

The game might have been salvagable at that point, even with the enormous spread rates in the grass, except that the wind increased again to Strong (the highest speed) at 1400 and increased the spread rate from 9 (head) - 1 (flank) to 17-2. This caused the fire to explode across the road. It burnt around the hex the engine, smokejumpers, and IA squad had reinforced but burned over the adjacent hex where two smokejumper squads were working. Fortunately, they were able to shelter in the neighboring hex with their coworkers but were effectively eliminated from the game due to shock. The fire blew several hexes past my firefighters and held up at a river and road. I ordered both tankers for $10,000 total as well as additional firefighters and engines.

However, after looking at the map and anticipating the several turns of decreasing humidity and the topography and vegetation the fire had to burn over I came to the conclusion there was likely nothing I could do to keep it from escaping the map (the spread rate was going to increase to 19-2 next turn, barring an unexpected wind decrease or humidity increase). Plus, it would have been a very complicated bit of determining the actual fire growth and I was quickly running out of fire counters.

The fire growing off the map is one of the automatic game end conditions so I just decided to call it there. This was actually the 2nd fire start location I had used. The first would have resulted in an automatic loss for me as it was so close to the edge of the map I decided to &quot;restart&quot; to give myself a chance.</body>

	<body>It&#039;s been a long while since posting here - still playing games but seem to lack the time or motivation to post about them. However I do need to post about this one. So I got given this in the 2015 Secret Soloist exchange last year but have only just got round to trying it for the first time :blush:. 

I had some concerns about the amount of time it would take to play having tried Silent War before. However after a bit of time to read the rules, this plays pretty quickly. It&#039;s a solo game and basically lots of die rolls but there is a great narrative as you Captain your U-Boat in patrol after patrol hoping to survive until June 1943. There is a feeling of failure when returning from a patrol with no successes and encountering a convoy gives lots of options before being attacked by the escorts. If detected you start to feel the pressure as your boat gets hit and gradually starts to fail and you hope to evade the escorts depth charges.

My first game was pretty successful. I started in 1939 in a basic Type VIIB having successful patrols around the British Isles and Spanish Coast. I then upgraded to a Type VIIC and started venturing into the Atlantic. My first voyage there saw me sinking a small freighter and then encountering the Ark Royal. I tried a close range attack but was run off by the escorts though I did cause some damage. I survived until July 1941 before being sunk and killed but did rack up 11 patrols, sinking 18 ships of 114,500 tonnes and having been promoted to Korvettenkapitan and scoring a marginal victory.

A second game and a much poorer performance. This U-boat commander started in April 1940 in a Type IXB boat. The first patrol was to the Spanish coast but before even managing to transit the Bay of Biscay the boat was significantly damaged and while the patrol continued there were no encounters with merchant shipping and the patrol was a failure. Second time out was better with a couple of convoy encounters in the Atlantic, but still coming back damaged. The third patrol was to drop an Abwehr agent in Ireland and again the boat was damaged by an aircraft attack before managing to drop off the agent. Once completed the commander continued around the British Isles sinking another couple of ships but the escort attacked the boat. While the U-boat survived and eventually returned safely to port the Commander died from wounds suffered when the boat was damaged during the escorts attack. Three patrols. 4 ships sunk and only 21000 tonnes sunk. Failure :(

I really enjoyed this and many thanks to my SS whoever you were for getting this for me and also thanks for the extra boards and counters you made to go with it. They are excellent.

	<body>[b]Drawing Complete![/b]

So, let&#039;s have some Valentine&#039;s Fun... 

I printed and laminated this game for myself so I can play with dry erase markers over and over again. 

But... I had an Abundance event!

I made three extra copies! 

So, let&#039;s do a week-long mini-contest.  

On 2/19, I&#039;ll draw a three winners who will receive their very own laminated copy of this great &quot;Lost&quot; game of Nick Hayes. (Not sure how I&#039;ll draw yet since I&#039;m doing a bonus entry... I&#039;ll have to figure that out.) 

:d6-1:All you need to do to enter is thumb this geeklist item. 
:d6-2:A bonus entry can be earned by reading the rules, playing the game, and posting your score as a comment below.

I always encourage folks to rate the games they play, but there won&#039;t be a bonus for that... :)

So get out there and hunt some beasts!

UPDATE:
The Winners have been chosen!

	<body>In honor of the new SotM Oblivaeon kickstarter I decided I needed to play some more Sentinels. I currently own the base game, Infernal Relics, and Shattered Timelines. I don&#039;t have nearly enough plays of the game and haven&#039;t played against all the villains I own or used all the heroes. I determined that I needed to try to play through everything I had at lest once if I was really going to justify sticking with this KS pledge, so I thought up my own kind of challenge/campaign to run through everything.


[b][size=18]The AlphaBeta Multiverse Challenge:[/size][/b] 
A Sentinels of the Multiverse Campaign/Challenge to help get everything played

This challenge is a way to hopefully work through all the characters, villains and locations that one may own for the giant SotM universe. I have no idea if it will work out, but it will hopefully be good fun.

[b]What is it:[/b] The AlphaBeta Multiverse Challenge is a series of linked battles in the Sentinels of the Multiverse universe. In true villainous style the bad guys of the multiverse have decided they all want to destroy earth while the Sentinels have of course banded together to stop this grave threat. However, a strange and mysterious energy known only as AlphaBeta has exerted it&#039;s will before the fight could even begin. Both the villains and the heroes have found themselves hampered by this strange menace. 

AlphaBeta&#039;s Influence: [b]During setup the heroes, villains, and location must be chosen alphabetically starting with A for all categories.[/b] (For instance, my first game was Absolute Zero, Argent Adept, and Bunker in the Block against Akash&#039;Bhuta.) For subsequent game things will continue to be chosen alphabetically, however heroes and villains will have some alterations based on the outcome of the previous game. 

[b]If the heroes defeated the villain:[/b]
- That villain is destroyed and cannot be used again this campaign. 
The villain for the next game will be the next one in line alphabetically. If you reach Z then begin again at A with previously benched villains.
- Any heroes that that were knocked out during the game are destroyed and cannot be used for the rest of the campaign. 
- All heroes that survived the battle are fully healed. If only 1 hero survived that hero must compete in the next battle. If more than 1 hero survived then the hero closest to the beginning of the alphabet that survived is benched (they can still be used in future campaign missions if you cycle back through the alphabet) all other surviving heroes must be used in the next battle.
- In order to fill out your hero roster for the next mission you continue to select alphabetically based on where you left off with the previous mission. If you reach Z go back to A and begin again using only heroes that have previously been benched during the campaign.

[b]If the villain defeated the heroes:[/b]
- If this is the 1st or 2nd time the villain has won that villain is completely healed and will be used for the next mission.
- If this is the 3rd time the villain has won that villain is benched. Use the next villain alphabetically for the next mission. If you reach Z then begin again at A with previously benched villains.
- All heroes are destroyed and cannot be used for the rest of the campaign.
- Select new heroes alphabetically based on where you left off with the previous mission. If you reach Z go back to A and begin again using only heroes that have previously been benched during the campaign.

[b]Always choose the next location in line alphabetically[/b] based on where you left off with the previous mission. Locations are never destroyed, they are just benched. If you reach Z just choose the next location alphabetically starting with A.
[b]
Winning the campaign:[/b]
The heroes win if all the villains are destroyed and at least 1 hero is still alive.
The Villains win if all the heroes are destroyed and at least 1 villains is still alive.


Variants:
This can easily be changed to choose randomly instead of alphabetically. Make sure benched heroes/villains are not chosen until every other hero/villain has fought at least once while that hero/villain has been on the bench.



On to my first playthrough:

Heroes: Absolute Zero, Argent Adept, Bunker
Villain: Abush&#039;Bhuta
Location: The Block

The Block may be Abush&#039;s ideal environment. There are a lot of units that enter play in that location which means Abush gets extra draws. This game got very difficult very quickly when Abush drew the one shot which went 3/3 and pulled 3 of her minions onto the battlefield. This combined with all the extra activations from the block meant that we were in a bad way early. Zero quickly got his equipment into the play and bunker had a decently set up turret as we tried to stabilize, but Abush went back-to-back turns of destroying equipment then ongoing cards with something like 6 minions in play and a couple agents in the Block. Not long after that an inmate blasted Bunker for 12 damage and it was all over but the crying. Our heroes fought valiantly for many more turns but there was very little they could accomplish. Once they got the equipment and things back up it was destroyed again and eventually the earth opened wide and sucked them to her depths. I believe Abush was at 147  health in the end. A rather poor showing. It almost makes me want to change my rules and not let the villains heal, but that&#039;s not fun. Hopefully the next group of heroes will fair much better. Chrono-Ranger, Fanatic, and Haka are going to tear that mountain down.


Edit for Playthrough #2.

Heroes: Chrono-Ranger, Fanatic, Haka
Villain: Abush&#039;Bhuta
Environment: Insula Primalis

This game started very different than the last one. Abush was summoning very few minions and the environment was not helping the mountain that much. My heroes&#039; hands weren&#039;t particularly good but were good enough to take early control along with 2 obsidian fields in the first 2 environment draws meant I was doing good damage with just basic abilities and Abush still wasn&#039;t putting minions down and the Chrono-Ranger was able to deal the ongoing cards.

Eventually a third Obsidian Field came down and I was able to maintain control, Fanatic&#039;s basic power was doing 8 damage to a single target and Haka&#039;s weapon was hitting 2 people for 6 each along with 1 shot AOE cards from Fanatic things felt well in hand. Abush finally got some minions out and hit the heroes pretty hard but it wasn&#039;t enough as Fanatic had an end of days and Haka had a 17 damage combo in hand. 

As prophesied above the mountain crumbled under the power of Chrono-Ranger, Fanatic and Haka. Chrono-Ranger will retire for a bit as Fanatic, Haka and Legacy take on Apostate next.

Edit for playthroughs 3 &amp; 4:

Game 3 saw Fanatic, Haka, and Legacy take down Apostate at the Megapolis. This game was close through the early and mid-game with Apostate doing a fine job of getting his relics out. Fortunately I was able to stabilize and take of the relics with some fine defensive plays from Haka and Legacy while Fanatic kept the environment mostly under control. Then it was just manipulating things so the final relics could go down before Apostate. Fanatic of course finished him in a truly fitting end.

Game 4 saw Fanatic retire while Nightmist joined Haka and Legacy to fight Baron Blade in the Realm of Discord. I had never played Nightmist but looked through her deck and thought I had a decent idea. Well it turned out my plan to just have her draw a bunch of cards and hope she drew her big heal spell almost worked. However, I casted another spell to discard that heal spell twice. As it happened this caused both Legacy (who was tanking a good deal of her damage) and Nightmist to quickly enter the single digit health range. Nightmist got as low as 3. A few good defensive plays from Haka and Legacy along with the Baron&#039;s inability to destroy ongoing cards ended up spelling his doom. Once Legacy found his damage power things ended for the Baron rather quickly. A close game for one of the easier villains in the game. We&#039;ll have to see how the new group fairs as Haka is retired and replaced with Omnitron-X to fight Citizen Dawn.</body>

	<body>So I pulled this out for a play, as I wanted to play something &quot;Euro-y&quot; and tight. I really focused on /planting/trading early on so I could spend cash on moving up the points ladder rather than on vegetables. I also did a couple of two packs that netted some really useful helpers.Once I got the farming engine going I was able to please a good amount of regular customers. That along with keeping the balance right with casual customers(I was always able to get the bonus) helped me rake in the dough. Final Score: [b]19[/b]
:star: This game is just so elegant. The mechanics, components and the flow of the game is second to none.
:star: The vegi-meeples. I just love them, and they are probably some of my favorite components of any game I own
:star: The tightness. I own(and love) Fields of Arle, but I don&#039;t play that game, I just explore and see what happens. This game you have to bring it and really focus/adjust your strategy
:halfstar: Beat your high score. It is not the best win condition in a solo game, but I also do not see getting a 18/19(is 20 possible?) on a regular basis. I accept that I will be scoring 15/16/17 most times.</body>

	<body>This was an exciting game. I was sticking to a very specific strategy. I was only focusing on blue worlds. I would draw cards, keep any blue ones and use any others for fodder. I didn&#039;t even place one development, I just had blue worlds that producied goods and gave me consume powers. I had a nice engine where I made goods and sold them off. In the very last turn, I did settle a brown world but that was just to get two extra VPs. 

I felt very strong about a victory coming. I was even the player who emptied out the VP token pile. 

I counted up my score: 32 points!

I counted up the robot&#039;s score: 32 points!!

I looked for the tie breaker, and the robot got me. His economy was five and mine was only three. 

Next time, Robot. Next time!</body>

	<body>I wasn&#039;t sure if I was going to trade this away or keep it, so I decided to give it another go last night.  I need to finish the last round of the game, but decided to put some notes down.  While the AI flowcharts still don&#039;t allow you to play completely solo (as you&#039;re able to see their hands, and have to make some decisions for them) I did find it to be as interesting as my first play.  The actual depth in the game, the vision of the debating of issues is very clearly in my mind with this game - I can see tempers flaring, points being added and conceded during the discussions.  That for me is genius.

The second part of the game - the impact to the war is more disconnected, as if it&#039;s an overview of what happened as a direct outcome of their meeting.  This is where I struggle a bit - the outcome here is interesting in the fact that you&#039;re trying to progress on many fronts at the same time, and in some instances you want to hold others back so you can share in the glory at the same time (e.g. getting into Germany with only one front gives a huge point advantage) - but you don&#039;t want to screw them completely over or everyone will lose.

So, I&#039;m still conflicted, still trying to ponder what this game actually does for me. What I do know is that it&#039;s quite unique from the other games I have, and one of the most interesting that I&#039;ve played in a long time.</body>

	<body>Man I love this game!  The Titans are so much fun to play against.  This was my first game using the extras from the expansion as well as equipment.  The equipment feels a bit as a cheat since it provides additional crowd favor and an extra ability.  But, to me it adds to the overall experience.  So far I have only battled Menoetius.  He&#039;s the easiest of the bunch but can still be brutal depending on the dice.  Today he was overwhelmed.  The crowd favorite &quot;Hugo&quot; made a late entry and helped to take down the giant.

I don&#039;t ever plan on playing The Lost Cities again.  I&#039;d love to sell it and recoup my costs but I can&#039;t bare to part with the cities :)

I replaced the damage chips with 11.5g clay poker chips from Amazon.  At 100ct for $7.50, it was a wise purchase.  I keep 25 at my desk just to play around with during the day.</body>

I played Quest 2 of the full campaign. I had played the Tutorial and Quest 1 about a month and a half ago, and really enjoyed that. It took a while to game again, period, with regards to solitaire play.

I had to slightly refresh on the rules, but that didn&#039;t take very long. And I am very enamored with [b][thing=181521]Warhammer Quest TACG[/thing][/b]. I&#039;ve won Quests 1 and 2 now, though this one was looking a lot more threatening.

What tickles my fancy in this game is a few things: it&#039;s thematic, which is not easy to pull off with cards, especially with regards to a sense of place and travel that the game conveys, and how the Enemies work. Then, there is ample choice. Things may be sort of evident, but not automatic (for me). Especially as I start to string together actions (playing with 2 Heroes, each has 2 Activations), also over Rounds, I&#039;m seeing strategy emerge on when to do what. The basics are straightforward, but there is quite some depth in this card game.

Lastly the &quot;RPG&quot; aspect (when did &quot;RPG&quot; become exclusively synonymous with &quot;leveling up&quot;?!?), which, though light, adds another layer of choice. It&#039;s palpable, even between Quests 1 and 2, how the Heroes become stronger, more resilient, more flexible.

And then there&#039;s of course the possibility in later campaigns to try out the other Heroes, and other combinations. The Waywatcher and Warrior Priest are so far a potent duo, winning 2 out of 2 Quests.

In summary, I highly recommend this game for solitaire play. The 2 Hero minimum (you can&#039;t play with just 1) is not much of a burden. The actions in principle are the same, and there are no hand cards to manage. There is some setup time in building the decks, but not overbearing in any way. And, to stress this point, it&#039;s [i]much[/i] more thematic than I expected.

:thumbsup: Thematic, tense gameplay with narrative and &quot;leveling&quot;.
:thumbsdown: Some setup and breakdown time.
:thumbsdown: No expansions announced yet!</body>

	<body>Here we go [listitem=3637563]again![/listitem]

[url=https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/12/27/thorin-and-company-a-thematic-journey-through-the-hobbit/]This deck[/url] has gotten me to change it up a bit. As you can see in the link above, I went after it thus far with a 2 deck solo plan. But that deck does a great job being solo, thematic/canonical, and designed to beat both sagas. I decided I didn&#039;t really want to play [thing=123695][/thing] because I really didn&#039;t like the riddle game. Which is unfortunate since it&#039;s such a famous part of the story. 

So, I built that deck and added the Ring and Sting treasure cards to it since they would have been there for Flies and Spiders. I could add Orcrist too I suppose. We&#039;ll see. I was in a bit of a funk with games and this game for a little while there, but sometimes just doing it and setting it out etc, gets you back in the swing. 

Well, I swung...and missed. I play on Easy Mode, so that makes it worse. Bilbo died on turn 3 because there were too many spiders. I think I quested too hard initially and therefore had no one to combat the spiders or defend either. Also, I had Lure of Moria (ready all dwarves) and didn&#039;t use it. :shake:

Off to another crack at it!

[b]2/13/16:[/b]
This went better! I managed to win with 40 threat left. This is a fun quest with lots of thematic elements. I like especially that you turn the dwarfs upside down to demonstrate them being unconscious! Just as if they were hung upside down by spiders! And you spend Bilbo&#039;s resources to free them up, and you use the ring to get more resources for Bilbo! Though that costs you 1 threat. Thankfully, Gandalf was able to be a threat reducer on 2 occasions. We&#039;ll just say his battle with the Necromancer helped to stem the growth of evil in the forest even from afar...that&#039;ll do.:whistle:

I had almost the entire Dwarf crew out. This deck uses Longbeard Elder and Mapmaker as proxies for I think Bombur and Oin, and I was able to get Longbeard Elder out to do a great job with Encounter deck scrying. Longbeard mapmaker languished in my hand, and I looked a the deck and Bofur and Gloin decided to sit this one out (slackers).

On my last turn I drew the card that lets me ready all dwarf characters, so I quested with everybody, knowing I could ready them all, whatever came. Game over! 

[b]Edit, later that day on 2/13/16:[/b]
Having finished that I went after the Lonely Mountain scenario. I had gotten stalled on this with my old pair of decks, so I was interested to see how it would go. It&#039;s tough because you have to get Smaug out of the staging area because he keeps attacking you, that means you need to land some hits on him and he&#039;s got 8 defense! I was able to get &quot;A bare patch&quot; to attach to him, which reduced that by 3 and then a beefed Thorin and Gandalf and everyone else left in hit him for a total of 8 (I think that took 2 turns to get it all though). Then you just have to get more quest tokens on the quest than Smaug has remaining HP. So, I was able to get things set up for everyone to quest at once just like last time and Ended up with 16 (for a total of 19, it requires 20 to finish) and that moved Smaug off. I had just about every dwarf out. I couldn&#039;t get Kili back out, because he and Fili were chump blocking. I managed to get Dori out after his ability protected the heroes from Smaug&#039;s attack. 
I appreciated the thematic-ness of Bilbo using his ring to evade Smaug&#039;s attacks (I used him as the primary Smaug defender). I was very fortunate to only have a few Burgle extra attacks. I may have misplayed some of that, but I&#039;m counting it a win and moving on, this is more about the stories for me rather than any score. 

[b]Edit, much later that day on 2/13/16:[/b]

Oh. My. Word. What an epic finish! Since I finished The Lonely Mountain I couldn&#039;t wait to get set up for the Battle of Five Armies. I played 2 games to start with which ended rather quickly. I got overwhelmed very right off the bat in both games, just not able to get this deck&#039;s engine going. With Thorin and Ori, you have to get Fili or Kili out immediately (whichever one is the Leadership sphere) so that you can have 5 dwarfs and get the extra card and the extra resource. 
Then, you have 3 quests to complete at the same time, but can only do one at a time! And, if you don&#039;t do one, then you get penalized by the other 2! It&#039;s quite the war of attrition and a back and forth seesaw. 
I managed to get rid of the 2 locations which bleed your quest advancement. 
But, it was how it ended that was so great. At the end you have to kill Bolg and he is, of course, really hard. Fili and Kili went down chump blocking (though just like in the book!) and I had enough attack with the others to kill Bolg, but he got a second attack after killing Kili. Should I have him do another chump? Nope. Thematic all the way! Thorin would not survive an attack. So, he went down. Just like the book. So satisfying! </body>

	<body>I really love the Oniverse games. Something about them is very soothing to me. That being said I pulled both this and Onirim out to play. I went with this one first as I don&#039;t have as many plays with it.
I ended up losing, as I didn&#039;t have enough trees out(a total of 5 points to the 7 desiccated trees). Too many of the support cards came out that really thinned my deck and caused mreto discard most of my strong cards. It didn&#039;t help that my fountains mostly got played in the last row, which pretty much  stopped me the strategy of getting trees behind them.
Anyhow I really love these games. Onirim is up next. And let me say it is [i]killing[/i] me that none of my FLGS are stocking Castellion. I never spend enough at online games stores to get free shipping..so I can&#039;t justify paying the shipping to get this one game.
:star: A unique, fun game with unique mechanics
:star: Probably the coolest card drafting mechanic I have seen in a solo game

	<body>This entry isn&#039;t for a play of a game, but rather a story for Heart Month. I chose this game for two reasons. One, because the story involves Houston and two, because this game&#039;s year is listed as 1977, which is the closest I could get to the year in which the story takes place (probably late 1978/early 1979).

I think I was in 1st grade at the time if memory serves me correctly. I was like six years old at the time. There was a boy in my class named Seth who was diagnosed with a hole in his heart. I can&#039;t remember if I knew exactly what was wrong back then or learned it later. Seth had to go to Houston to have open heart surgery, which would repair his heart. I remember all of us saying goodbye to Seth before he left and we even had a little sendoff for him. Back in those days, open-heart surgery was new and cutting-edge medicine. That&#039;s why Seth had to go to Houston. I believe the hospital there was one of the few in the United States doing that type of surgery at the time.

Sometimes, I think back to that time and try to remember what my thoughts and feelings were about the situation. Of course, it was an awfully long time ago so I don&#039;t recall too many details, but I do remember thinking nothing of the fact that Seth was going away. I thought, oh he&#039;ll be back in a few weeks. No big deal. I had no idea how serious the surgery was he was about to undergo and no idea about the angst and fear his parents must have felt. I was just too young to comprehend the enormity and seriousness of it all.

Fortunately, the story does have a happy ending. Seth returned to school some time later wearing his Astros hat and regaled us with stories of how he went to a game and all the other things he did while in Houston. All his classmates were of course delighted to see him, but just in the way that kids are when they see a friend they haven&#039;t seen for a while. We had no inkling just how serious the whole situation was and how high a chance there was that Seth wouldn&#039;t have returned to us. Seth is still alive today; in his mid-forties and healthy so far as I know.

When I think back on that and some recent experiences I&#039;ve had while visiting hospitals, it amazes me how far medicine has progressed over the years and the miracles that are worked every day. Procedures that were risky and cutting-edge are commonplace now. It really makes me appreciate all those in the medical profession: the nurses, doctors and staff that take such good care of us when we are most in need of help.</body>

	<body>I played this one using the Dream Catcher expansion for the first time.
All the lost dreams came out pretty early and I managed to keep them &quot;caught&quot; but too many nightmares forced me to discard a number of cards so I got behind the eight ball and only managed to get 5 doors out. I do have to say it was better than I thought. Didn&#039;t really have a desire to play the Dream Catchers before as I tend to like the expansions that don&#039;t change the base game too much(I love the base game). Will have to break it again for another play...but right now Zombicide is calling my name.</body>

So, I decided to try, Girl&#039;s Night Out.

She-Hulk, X-23, Marvel Girl, and Kitty Pryde went out on the town, only to be accosted by Red Hulk, Quicksilver, Iron Man, and Ant Man.

[IMG]https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d6/ee/2f/d6ee2f8e62e024be33b314e6e3d60f73.jpg[/IMG]

This was a battle for the ages.

She-Hulk and Iron Man became quite a challenge, as neither wanted to lose their defense on a careless attack. A few widdle downs and a couple big strikes brought both teams down to the single digits.

That&#039;s when the globals kicked in.

Iron Man and a Sidekick came at She-Hulk, but after the Sidekick stole her Attack Power, she stole Iron Man&#039;s Attack Power....

[IMG]http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ant-man.jpg[/IMG]

Ant-Man&#039;s global switched Iron Man&#039;s Defense to his Attack.
End of story.

Final Score: The Boys-1, The Girls-0.

:thumbsup: This game has some mad tactics.
:thumbsup: The dice are addicting. I ordered some Spidey villains, and some other X-Men favorites to add to the fun.</body>

	<body>From the designer of Biblios comes Cosmic Run! Is it any good? 

Hmmm. Well, it gives a [i]much[/i] better value for buck than Galaxy Command. Deeper and more varied game play, much better components, and a solid box that doesn&#039;t bulge when you put the cards back into it. Between two games that go for roughly the same price MSRP-wise, I would definitely choose COSMIC RUN (not Galaxy Command!!!). 

Does it succeed as a dice game? 

Hmmm. Well, now I need to recall the dice games I have: 

- VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game. Offers two solo scenarios with varying powers from game to game, and multiple dice combinations. Special powers are activated by choosing what particular colors to set aside.  

- Pandemic: The Cure. Special powers for multiple characters represented by different dice for each player, and a different die face distribution for each disease color, and a physical board to move on for an extra logistics challenge. 

- Elder Sign. Lots of different die combinations and requirements to clear out the ticking timb bomb that is the Elder God. Multiple Elder Gods in the base game, many characters to choose from with different player powers. 

- Roll for It. Roll dice, allocate wisely to cards you need to make without a certain number of die rolls (at least for a particular solo variant). Dice can be allocated across multiple turns, and there are different combinations with varying point values. 

- Favor of the Pharoah/To Court the King. Yahtzee the Gathering: use different die combinations to claim cards that give you special die manipulation powers. Lots and lots of die manipulation powers, since you eventually need to roll seven of a kind. No official solo variants. 

- Roll Through the Ages (Bronze Age, Iron Age). You build a civilization up and get more special powers. I think the building part is very satisfying. 

- I have more, if you can believe it. 

- And then Cosmic Run. Single scenario, need to complete sets of same-numbered dice to advance on planetary tracks while the ticking time bomb of meteors land on planets, need to sacrifice victory points (which don&#039;t serve as VP as much as currency in the solo game) and discover them all. Different die combinations are needed to claim alien cards with special powers (a limited set of three each turn), which you need to win the game as one of the planets requires five-of-a-kind to advance, difficult to achieve on six dice. 

I feel that in Cosmic Run solo you can get stuck on three alien cards every turn, which is frustrating, but it&#039;s within the parameters of a good, challenging game. But... I feel so much better, somehow, when I have more choices to spend my dice on rather than just three alien cards with unique die requirements (even if you do refresh them whenever you claim a card) and the same &quot;roll X of a kind to advance&quot; on the planets. It feels... unsatisfying somehow, even though the game is primarily one of needing to sacrifice, far more so than in other games, dice for a particular purpose versus the main purpose that will eventually win the game, but which will not succeed unless you do that at some point in time. 

And as special powers have limited round use, it&#039;s... well, hmmm. It&#039;s still interesting, but somehow unsatisfying, even though there is no reason it should be unsatisfying. Maybe I just have too many dice games and am a bit jaded—or spoiled. 

Nevertheless, the game runs very smoothly, and does have an arc as you rescue planets but need to spend more and more points on shielding the last vulnerable ones before they run out of hit points. I just want more... stuff. More special powers. More meat. But that would change the aspect of the game. 

I feel it does succeed as a dice game, a bit on the medium-light side as dice games go (and they are a lighter genre than others). 

Man, but I just want more something. But at the same time, perhaps everything I actually need is already there. Maybe I need to discard all alien cards when I don&#039;t claim one during a particular turn, to give freshness to the selection. The solution to my ennui about the game could be as simple as that.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve just backed the fantastic looking solo-playable [thing=180809][/thing] on Kickstarter - in the game you have to follow a trail of clues through 19th century London to try and thwart a conspiracy that threatens Queen and Country. [i](If you&#039;re interested, check out the how-to-play videos on the KS page: [url]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1962940641/victoriana-a-cooperative-game-of-intrigue-and-inve[/url])[/i]

Anyway. This got me all enthused about a game I&#039;ve not played in a long long time - [thing=15987][/thing].  I originally stopped playing this because I always felt like I was just going through the motions - for some reason the theme just wasn&#039;t enough to make this an enjoyable experience  for me.  This time, maybe because it&#039;s been a good few years since I&#039;ve last played, I did enjoy the game a lot, though - of course - I lost horribly.  I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll play it again anytime soon, if I&#039;m being honest, but I will probably break it out again in a year or so :)

This has the distinction of being the 1st game from Sierra Madre Games that I&#039;ve grasped after the first read through. Not saying I&#039;m good at it just felt like I had a handle on how the game flowed and how to win.
Lots of fun and history as well. Looking forward to the expansion with possible appearance of Flashman.</body>

	<body>Yet again a VERY long span between my last post here, but I do live vicariously through the very active folks here!

Last night I played Scenario 1 of this and enjoyed it thoroughly.  What a great system.  With on the APC left, the AI went on a tear protecting the victory hex and blowing away my rifle units with amazing rolls.

1 Rifle unit left -vs- the APC and I managed to destroy it in close combat.  Soviets (me) won with 1 VP.

Looking forward to trying the next scenario, hopefully not waiting 6 months to do so. :D</body>

Back to the game. The second movie introduces the vigilant ability, which I found quite powerful at the end of the game. But it was a bit more challenging than the 1st movie. I played with the Commander and the Scout.

The setup:

Nice. Liked it very much though I&#039;m still going through the Rulebook all the time.

Played the tutorial mission, which is a small map, here&#039;s the setup:

	<body>At the suggestion of those more experienced than I, I tried out the 20 move solo variant for Harbour today.  It was definitely an interesting change, and much easier to manage than the normal solo game (whose rules are unfortunately written on the back of the dummy player card...).  I managed to build by fourth building on turn 19, scoring a total of 37 points.  Quite an enjoyable experience.

	<body>Not been feeling the call of games much this week, but this was close to hand, and wanted to play something before a full-on funk set in.

Several games tonight only 1 win.

First game lost, but may not have needed to as there were a couple of Lines built, but I forgot the line-bonus and was still using 4 Castle Tiles to escort a Traitor to the tanty.

Won the next due to lucky draws - first Tower spotted Harpies, so built more Towers to defend - which exposed more Harpies, so no rebuilding was needed between battles.

I may need to change strategy as I tend call on the True Blue guard after a Tower exposes the first Ordeal.  Tonight&#039;s remainder games all opened with early &amp; steady flow of Traitors disrupting the Castle; with Boss Traitors appearing early as well, so a string of quick losses.</body>

	<body>After waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep, I deigned to pass the time with some lighter fare. Using the Fortis cards/missions expansion, I was able to get through the deck and score what I believe is a respectable 35 points (out of a total possible of 52 - provided you complete EVERY mission and ignore the points on scorable characters).  Made for a nice (very) early morning puzzle.

	<body>I got out some of my old fantasy miniatures and played a little battle with these rules. I think they&#039;re pretty simple rules, but with a good amount of nuance and flexibility.

I played the basic &quot;bloodbath&quot; scenario, which is just a straight up head to head battle. Tossed a few terrain pieces (a small hill and some woods) on the table; put together 2 armies, 1 dwarven and 1 goblin; and started playing each side to the best of my ability. There isn&#039;t any hidden information (at least not in this scenario), and there is enough uncertainty with the activation rolls and rolling for combat results and morale (courage) tests to keep things interesting from a solo standpoint.

You don&#039;t need a lot of figures to play nor a huge table. I had 4 goblin units of 12 figures each and 1 of 6 figures, and 3 dwarven units of 12 figures each and 1 of 6 figures, and played on my dining room table (about 3 ft by 4 ft). Took a couple of hours to play, including taking a few notes and snapshots, looking through the rulebook as I went. I figure it will take even less time to play once I get the rules down and I don&#039;t think it would take long to reach that level.

I played with standard unit sizes, but the rules also cover the option of using fewer models with more strength points per model. So, for example, you might have a unit that is comprised of 3 trolls, each with 4 strength, or a single large dragon or giant with 12 strength points. I also played with only 20 points worth of units, rather than the suggested 24 points. You can go larger or smaller. although there probably are practical lower and upper limits. What I had worked out well on the table size I used.

:thumbsup: fairly simple rules
:thumbsup: adaptable, flexible
:thumbsup: works well with a reasonably small number of figures, and on a reasonably small table
:thumbsup: looks like it can mesh well with [thing=134524][/thing], the previous historical rules that Dragon Rampant is based on

:thumbsdown: there were a few things I was unsure about, but I just went ahead with my best judgement. For example, I didn&#039;t find any rules of instructions on placing terrain on the battlefield, but there are many rules and other resources that cover various ways to do that. Another example, a sample dwarven army list gives a leader as one option and mentions adding hornblowers, but doesn&#039;t say whether that&#039;s just for show or if it has any effect. Minor things that veteran miniature gamers will likely be able to sort out on their own.

A good set of miniatures rules for small fantasy battles

Edited: I hope this is kosher - if anyone is interested I wrote up a quick battle report with a few (terrible) photos on my mini blog at [url]http://talesofmirth.blogspot.com/2016/02/dragon-rampant.html[/url]</body>

	<body>Opened the box up yesterday and starting playing around with the bits.  I set up a quick start two player game (gave the official solo variant a pass until I had more experience with the flow of the game), and after overthinking and reading into a few rules too deeply I got started.  

The game clips along at a nice pace.  There are definitely some weighty decisions to be made: how best to utilize dice, making sure you don&#039;t get too many peasants and spend all your time trying to feed them while still having enough to put in your building so you can use their abilities, what resources you should collect based on what buildings you have in your abbey so you can get the best out of each trade...it&#039;s good.  Real good.

	<body>Got this out today to play the 5th legend, which is just epic. The 3rd one offers more replayabilty maybe, but this one is just awesome. 

Played with 3 characters again. I used Mairen, Kheela and Chada.

[imageid=2888699]

I think I was a bit lucky with the monster token draws along the game, but I also think that I managed and timed quite well when to take the castle and managed to save all the farmers.

[imageid=2888703]

Then the long fight against the dragon starts at the gates of the Dwarf city. At this point the heroes were quite strong, so we didn&#039;t struggle much with the dragon, but we had a couple of scares :ninja:

[imageid=2888707]

Finally, we retired to the tower to finish him there.

[imageid=2888714]

So with this, all the base legends have been conquered. I can&#039;t wait to put on the table the fan ones (have them printed but I have to prepare them :shake:) and the Legend of the Star Shield. 

Final thoughts:

:thumbsup: Offers something a bit different in the fantasy theme.
:thumbsup: Is not too long but not too short either, I played 60-120 min depending on the legend.
:thumbsup: Always a tight win, it keeps the tension high for the whole game and makes you think a lot.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Only the 5 legends in the base game feels a bit short, but thanks to community there is plenty of extra content and now there is support to the expansions in English.</body>

	<body>Finally parachuted in, this afternoon, and I&#039;ve been perusing the rules without too much head scratching. Looks lovely, and it&#039;s way more compact than I&#039;d assumed. Giving it a couple of experimental plays... but I think I&#039;ve already found a new travel companion.

	<body>When I play CN, I think of most of the game as managing two distinct tracks:
The War Track and the Political Track.

The War Track covers most of the board and boils down to four invading armies and strongholds

The Political Track consists of 6 different political forces vying for central locations of influence.  The player wants to keep Puritanism, Parliament, and Scotland in the center of the track, and wants to push Ireland, Monarchy, and Catholicism out of prominence and to the upper fringes of the track.  Let me show you:
[imageid=2888739 medium]

When you have created a favorable political environment, you can start obtaining achievements.  
[imageid=2888744 medium]

These bad boys allow you to go from merely surviving the war, to winning the game.  They give you unique power-ups, but more importantly, they give you all important victory points (blue triangles seen on the bottom)

I&#039;ve been ignoring achievements in my previous plays, just trying to understand the War Track.  The game I played this morning was my first go at achievements.  I managed to grab 2 in the first war, boosting my first war record from -4 to 3!

I enjoy the sense of skill-building I&#039;m getting from this game.</body>

	<body>I owe the SGOYT Made Me Buy This geeklist an entry for this game, but my purchasing the game was only halfway due to SGOYT. Somewhere online, I saw an advertisement for the upcoming Widowers of the Wood board game and that caused me to dig deeper; eventually realizing that WotW is a follow-up to The Undercity.

I started a solo campaign using three characters today. I plan to post a brief report on each chapter here on SGOYT. Today was Chapter 1: Body of Evidence. I chose Canice Gormleigh the Gun Mage Duelist, Milo Boggs the Cutthroat Alchemist and Gardek Stonebrow the Trollkin Warrior as my three characters for the campaign.

Start of Game

[imageid=2888835 original]

The objective of this chapter is to investigate the body surrounded by the four thugs and then dispatch the boss when he appears. Sounds easy right? Overall, I didn&#039;t find it overly challenging to win, but man are there an endless stream of enemies hurling at you in this game. You have to get to the space with the body and have it be clear of all villains before you can investigate. Once you do that, the Boss appears. It took me a few rounds to get over there and clear the villains out, but Canice eventually got there and investigated.

Here we see Gardek trying to clear out some baddies while Canice makes her way over.

[imageid=2888843 original]

In the meantime, Milo went after the side quest card, which I knew would be some kind of loot. It turned out that I needed to pass a Strength check of 13 to get the card. Milo tried several times, but was unable to roll the 9+ he needed. With Gardek being the strongest of my party at 6, I sent him over to try. I had two or three attempts to roll a 7+ on two dice and couldn&#039;t do it. Oh well, the card will be back in the next chapter&#039;s side quest deck.

Here we see that the Canice has investigated the body and the Boss (randomly determined to be an Epic Rhulic Mercenary) has arrived and entered the fray. Gardek is futilely trying to retrieve the Cinder Bomb card.

[imageid=2888853 original]

I actually only needed to land one more hit to kill the Boss, but delayed for two rounds trying to complete the side quest for the loot. I was down to my last Event card that signaled the final round so Canice moved in and used a Point Blank feat card to finish off the Rhulic Mercenary and win the game for the heroes!

[imageid=2888857 original]

After one play, I really like this game. The first mission seems pretty basic, but is a great intro to the game and does a good job setting up the story to come. The ability cards you can purchase between missions add a plethora of variability to character development. I like how the combat works and the way that you can add dice to your rolls or reroll through card plays or abilities. The inherent abilities of the characters and the feat cards are a nice touch. I don&#039;t think this game will replace the D&amp;D Adventure System games in my collection because they can be played as a one off easier and more quickly and there is something about those games that just hits me right in the feels. I do think that this game can peacefully coexist in my collection along with the D&amp;D games :D

I am now super-excited for the Widowers of the Wood Kickstarter. Check it out on 2/16!</body>

:thumbsup: Ability to select team to deal with the particular challenges of the mission
:thumbsup: Good variety of &quot;bad guys&quot;
:thumbsup: Playable of Tabletop Simulator
:thumbsup: Plays really fast

([url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/200307/item/4392658#item4392658]Maloma&#039;s February Challenge[/url])

[b]Score: 59[/b]

Win: +50
Mack (1): +5
Add. Boats: 0
Start Cards (3): -6
Contracts: +12 (5, 22, 28, 29, 38)
Resources: +1 (fur)
N. American: -3

This was my first attempt at the challenge.  I did not have a good journal offer to start with, and thought long and hard about whether or not start with a farewell action to get a new set.  I eventually decided to give it a go to see how I could do.  Not very well as it turned out, although I did eke out the victory.

I picked up Black Buffalo primarily to use as 2-strength card ,but his power did help later with river movement.  Lewis was my go-to for river, however.

I was too close to Mackenzie for much of the game, bouncing over him only to have him bounce ahead.  I could never seem to get a substantial lead on him.  I was moving steadily, but it was a neck-and-neck race.

With my final move, I managed to lunge 4 spaces past Clatsop with four cards left in hand.  I had to camp because Mackenzie was just one space from the fort.  I moved back four spots to camp directly on the fort and end the game.  This was my closest solo victory in quite some time.  In hindsight, I probably should have wiped the journal to find some more effective movement cards.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing the heck out of this one since I picked it up two weeks ago after Dave kept posting about it.  [listitem=4442528]I&#039;ve been posting some in depth AARs and commentary on this one over on my Exploration Geeklist[/listitem].  It&#039;s been a lot of fun!  The official solo rules out of the box were a little less than desirable.  Thankfully, a few fans had already come up with some alternatives.  Thus far, I&#039;ve settled on [thread=1516678]The Shadow Conspiracy[/thread] variant.

[ImageID=2889094medium]

Anyway, here&#039;s a summary of my thoughts on the game:

This is a sci-fi themed deckbuilder that sits comfortably in between Star Realms and Legendary: Marvel in terms of complexity, game length, and physical space.  Helionox is a fairly straightforward deckbuilder at its core, but it has a few nice tweaks that make it interesting.  First, there is a movement aspect to the game.  There are five locations where Events will erupt, and the player will need to move from one to another to deal with them.  Also, each location has a different special action the player can potentially use.  This is almost like an additional card that is always in play for you to use.

[ImageID=2878469medium]

Newly acquired cards go on top of your deck for immediate draw.  And cards not used at the end of your turn are held during the draw phase.  Then you may chose your hand from all those available.  This is a nice way to cycle unwanted cards out of the way as well as give additional options for the player from turn to turn.  Also, I like how the market is set up in four draw piles corresponding to the four different Factions.  This way, one card from each Faction (which generally focus on a different aspect of the gameplay) is always available for purchase.

Add to all this some really nice artwork, a small box (similar to Death Angel), and a reasonable price, Helionox is a really solid, little game.  Out of the box, it is only one or two player, but that&#039;s all I&#039;m interested in anyway.  At the time of this post, I&#039;m enjoying the fan made solo variant, [thread=1516678]The Shadow Conspiracy[/thread].  The solo rules in the box offer a very brief game session and don&#039;t allow for full use of the deckbuilding mechanisms in the 2P game.  The Shadow Conspiracy gives an experience closer to the 2P game without adding much in the way of bookkeeping for the AI opponent.

[ImageID=2889095medium]

Overall, I&#039;m pleased with this game.  It isn&#039;t super deep, but it has enough going for it to keep me interested, give me some challenge, and work my brain with the puzzly gameplay to maximize my endgame score.</body>

	<body>[thing=149241][/thing] has been on my table for quite a long time.  Specifically 17 plays worth, with many practice encounters in between plays... and I finally managed to eek out a true clean victory.

Then I packed it up, in favor for [thing=180585][/thing] which took me what must be a record 5 runs to complete... doh.  But it was fun, and kept me excited about the overall system enough that [thing=189035][/thing] will be an insta-buy.  

Today, the game was one that has been sitting around unopened for quite sometime (just as Marcy was) and earned the header of this geeklist item.

I have managed 1 play of the introductory scenario, and got slaughtered.  I played 2 characters, and wonder if I could handle the chaos of running 4.  Perhaps after I manage 2 a few times, I will bump to 4 to get the mesh of the party feel.  Just as I finally decided to start playing Doomrock with 4 characters.  This one is pretty similar to Doomrock in the dice allocation/dice puzzle aspect of the game, which is nice and interesting to see it in a different format, and I remain excited enough to make an uncommon for me SGOYT post.  It held my attention enough, and got my brain churning enough that I now sit on BGG thinking about the game looking up some rules, and watching some videos.... I will definitely give this game it&#039;s fair shake of a few plays before deciding on it&#039;s merit in my solo repertoire.

EDIT: Here is my playthrough

	<body>Got through the tutorial and I like what I&#039;m seeing, a lot of stuff made sense from the get go. A few cards in I tried to guess what the next best actions would be and I was correct most of the time. Then I decided to continue on after the first WQ card and dig into the bot charts - playing the Rebel side versus the robo-Royalists... These are really crunching my brain in some aspects, I don&#039;t know a better way to put it but they&#039;re kind of lawyer-speaky and I&#039;m more of an if-then mode brain. I&#039;m positive I&#039;m making some mistakes but I&#039;m slogging through to do my best to gain complete understanding.

I am enjoying it though and that&#039;s what is top priority so I&#039;m chalking up my first COIN experience to a &quot;good call&quot;.

Ooh, I almost forgot...

[youtube=jGUPsdOCZ-A]

---------------------------------------

So I finished out the rest of the tutorial game and I really like this system.  I&#039;m sure I got a few things wrong here and there but by the end I had quite a few things worked out well. I managed to dig into the rule book a little more too and read through a bunch of posts on the forum which helped me fill in gaps and solidify some rules.  The Patriots won the scenario with an overwhelming gap and I&#039;m thinking a big part of that is the head start they were granted by the events of the tutorial and potentially some rules errors I made along the way.  However, I did try to go back and correct some things as I went along if I made a mistake and it wasn&#039;t too far gone.  I certainly didn&#039;t run all over the Brits and Indians as there were quite a few times where they got me good. In one case I did manage to subvert what could have been a major loss at Charles Town by playing the French Brilliant Stroke card and taking Savannah instead (I played out the British action - it would have been really bad for the Patriots).

All in all I really like this game so far and I&#039;m looking forward to trying my first game without the training wheels.  I was tempted to set it back up immediately but I wanted to a) make sure everything would fit back into the box after I organized it all into a tray and assembled the leader standees and b) I wanted to get my ISGOYTRA rally done this afternoon while my son is napping.  I may break it back out later today.

	<body>After reading the rules for [thing=36325][/thing], I wanted to setup and play, but didn&#039;t feel it would go well. So, I decided to play a quick game of Onirim. (Gifted to me by [user=Fractaloon][/user]

Thanks so much Al! He used this one for his first podcast review.

So after mentioning my dislike for Beat-your-best-score type games, and winning the last 10 or so games of Onirim; I decided to create a scoring system to gauge my wins: 
After finding all 8 doors, score the following from the remaining cards in your hand and the draw deck:
20pts: dream card
10pts: key cards
1pt: sun/moon cards

I won with 3 dream cards, 3 key cards, and 5 sun/moon cards left in my hand and draw deck combined for [b]95pts![/b]. Not sure how awesome that is, but assured it&#039;s the best I can recall ever playing!

:star: Quick games
:star: Thinky without being a brain-burner,
:star: Did I say quick games?
:star: Quick games
:halfstar: Lots of shuffling

A very tight game design!

[b]2-player game with 10yo son[/b]:
Winning streak came to end, but we got close. We played open-handed working together. Hayden loves to discard the key cards to look at and reorder the top 5 cards of the draw deck (called &quot;prophecy&quot;). Of course, there is a good/bad time to use it, and not when you are about to get your set of three labyrinth cards for a door.
:star: Still, a very thrilling 2-player experience as well!

[b]Valentines Day Solo Nightmare[/b]
I made it out alive, and with [b]116pts[/b]!
3 dream cards: 60pts
4 key cards: 40pts
16 sun/moon cards: 16pts

:star: thankfully, the cards are made of durable linen stock.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve never won a game of this, but tonight I finally won my first game. The specialists really helped me tonight and I finally understood that skulls are not necessarily bad when you force them as RWB and get the 20 resources. After a dozen plays I think I finally got it. So this will hit the table again tomorrow to see if I can repeat the success.</body>

	<body>Recently when ordering various expansions for [thing=121297][/thing] I thought why not get [thing=176262][/thing] too. Mike Mullins&#039;s [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/124326/official-wharfside-solo-variant-designed-mike-mull]solo variant[/url] has proved to be an interesting challenge.

After two initial games marred by rules problems, I played three more today, correctly at last, at normal difficulty level (my scores first):

51-52 (-1)
[b]48-43[/b] (+5)
50-49 (+1)

[b]Outcome assessments[/b]:
less than 0: Your business fails and you sell your ship to pay the bills!
0-5: You&#039;ve paid the rent for another month, but you need to improve.
6-10: There&#039;s a new captain in town! (true victory)
11+: You&#039;ll not be buying a drink in Ridback Bay for a long time.

So I was oh so close to a true victory in that second game. It seems really tough to beat the AI--aka the captains--a good thing of course. I&#039;ve yet to see them fail to complete all five contracts. It&#039;s possible if they get too many good ones: all 8, 10, or 12 pointers that require four or five goods to fulfill. The other possibility is to keep their score down by sticking them with as many 5-point contracts* as you can. Both of these approaches are easier said than done, especially since luck is definitely a factor. In my best game above the captains had two good and three poor contracts.

*The captains are compensated with two bonus points for these contracts, so they&#039;re really worth seven points each.

	<body>Back to Nations again, and this time I decided to have a go at the Vikings nation. My experience so far with the various nations, especially the expansion ones, is that they all play differently, with focuses in different areas, and the Vikings are no exception. 

Their default special ability (choose a resource after production - everyone else loses 1 of that resource) is of no use in solo mode, so the first order of business was to take a turmoil card and change it to one of their other dynasties, in this case Normans. 

[imageid=2889224 medium]

Normans increases their raid value by 3, and that is a huge impact on their play. Battles, which normally give 2 (maybe 3 if you get a better unit early) units of a resource, now give you a minimum of 6! That&#039;s 3 from their starting Beserkers (Raid 3, but have a 2 food penalty), and an additional 3 from Normans. It does require that a few battles turn up in the market, but there was enough, so the Vikings brought them up every turn (where the shadow player didn&#039;t wipe them off first), allowing them to run with substandard buildings till better ones turned up. In this game the Vikings were not wanting for resources, which is quite a change, especially early game, and I was more than happy to keep using the Normans dynasty right through till game end.

Hawaii showed up again as well. It does absorb 5 turns (1 to buy, 4 turns to explore), but I am still certain that the free worker is more than worth it, making it a must buy most games (similar to Abraham Lincoln being a must buy I feel, as he lets you take workers as an action, so you can both grow at turn start and gain workers during it).

[imageid=2889253 medium]

All in all a very interesting and enjoyable session and I would be more than happy to play them again, ether solo or multiplayer. The only thing to keep in mind is that their starting wonder needs to be overbuilt, otherwise you lose 2 points - and that is quite a swing (2-3 min).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Final Score: 53[/COLOR]

Keeping with the V&#039;s Venice was my next choice. As they have an ability that always triggers when playing solo (if passed last: +2 books) I was quite happy to keep with that one, comfortably generating 5+ books per round. Their default colony Constantinople, giving a discount to Golden Ages, did encourage me to buy more of them for the bonus VP, and I think I accumulated the most VP tokens that I have thus far in Nations. I know there are other Advisor&#039;s/Nations that get a similar benefit, but I haven&#039;t played with them yet. Venice starts off with a military unit that doesn&#039;t have an associated penalty, so I used it early to acquire a colony, and then overbuilt it to concentrate on buildings, especially as I was having trouble getting the right ones to suit my needs at the time. Advisor&#039;s were also scare during the game, but a late rush on them , aided by natural wonders, helped fill out the slots. All in all another interesting session, with a [COLOR=#FF0000]final Score of 54[/COLOR].
Both games were played at Prince level. I think I still need quite a bit of practice before I increase the difficulty.

	<body>Canice, Milo and Gardek ventured back into the Undercity in Chapter 2: Unusual Suspects. They had to apprehend three suspects: an epic ogrun brute, an epic trollkin scout and an epic gobber cutthroat. 

Start of the game: the heroes start split up trying to locate and subdue the suspects before they can escape.

[imageid=2889297 original]

The suspects don&#039;t start on the board. Each game round after the first, one of them spawns at a random location on the board and then a second roll determines the exit (can&#039;t be the same location as where they start).

The order in which the suspects spawn is randomly determined by shuffling their cards and laying them in a line. The gobber cutthroat was first and he spawned directly across the board from his exit. Milo cut him off and after wounding him, took him out with an explosive grenade (forgot to get a picture).

Gardek had wandered to the far corner of the board for a side quest. He discovered a metal tube wedged in the wall which contained a map of a different part of the city. Unfortunately, he was now far from the other two suspects that had spawned and a crossbow thug took down Milo. As Gardek rushed to Milo&#039;s aid, just making it to revive him before he passed out, Canice took out the ogrun brute at point blank range - only one suspect to go!

[imageid=2889295 original]

With Milo revived and back on his feet, it was a race to subdue the trollkin scout before he escaped. Canice took a shot and hit, but only for one damage. Milo threw an acid grenade, but whiffed on his attack roll even though he boosted it. Doh! It was up to Gardek because time was short. Gardek charged in and took down the final suspect with a mighty blow from his axe - mission accomplished!

[imageid=2889298 original]

Another exciting game. I&#039;m hoping to play Chapter 3 tomorrow.</body>

	<body>Finally got to try this one out after it appeared in last year&#039;s Secret Soloist (Thanks again, and sorry for the long delay!).  Played the introductory scenario.

I began trying to be aggressive with raids on the Spanish intruders.  Things were going decently well, the enemy wasn&#039;t taking many turns (lots of Ceremony cards - a little annoying to me too but tolerable, I&#039;d spend them at every opportunity to reduce collisions).  I was building up nicely, 4 active families with a couple being aggressive and a couple more defensive (not being sure what I wanted) and plenty of food grown.  The Utes came by to fight and I smacked them down, claiming animals as spoils.

After the first Historical Event (Pueblo Revolt) the enemy was soon working on a giant Raid (11+6 AP).  I mismanaged my own resources and wasn&#039;t ready for it (if you have actions left and can Ambush the raiders, they can lose all their progress).  The raid was not a disaster but not good, my families&#039; men were covering the retreats.  For the last few turns I continued to draw Ceremonies so I couldn&#039;t afford to recover them, had to just rush back out to claim territory without the men.  The enemy threw out a bunch of Christian Missions to raise their morale, but my military score was still higher by enough from earlier strength to squeak out a major victory.

I quite liked the dynamic yet semi-predictable AI, and the pressure to do everything.  Hard to decide!
I did not like the piles of Ceremony cards (I had 7 of 16, it seems the normal ratio is 12/40) and the flipping around in the manual when Action A says do D instead, and D says do B, etc.

Definitely need to try the full-size scenarios, should be easier after trying it once.</body>

	<body>A new play, this morning, and I seemed to have fared far better; I made it about halfway through the mission deck before I drew the final disorganised card into my hand, and my men scattered in defeat. 

Seemed to manage my purchases far better - drew some real artillery into my hand, but I was beset by unlucky draws of static defences. And some of the terrain cards are way more punishing than they first appear. I managed to take down quite a few of the enemy, but the only solid objective I claimed was the Carentan Highway. It would have been worth 2 victory points, had I somehow survived. 

I like this. Got my head around the rules better and I like the flow of it. It&#039;s not such insurmountable odds as something like Shadowrun first appears, but you&#039;re fighting and making decisions at every turn. There&#039;s very little chaff or waste to the game, that I can see so far. 

Good times. 

[imageid=2889514large]
[i]An unusually useful draw... There&#039;s nothing worse than pulling a hand of three disorganised cards. (Well, maybe pulling four disorganised cards, I suppose.)[/i]</body>

First game went abysmal with only 43 points (my highscore being 107). Thats what bad die rolls can do to you. 2nd game went really good with 97 points and the third ending with 72 points. 

Always a fun filler and even after so many plays I am still not sick of the App&#039;s music...</body>

	<body>After buying this a couple of months back I finally decided to go against Volkare. I played a blitz Volkare return scenario with Norowas at the easiest difficulty. I didn&#039;t get very good tiles for moving around, lots of lakes and mountains, but Volkare decided to go in one direction only apparently, which gave me some time to put the city on the other side of the map and prepare for the battle. I conquered the city at the beginning of the second day, so I had plenty of time to heal and buy a couple of cards. And finally Volkare arrived during the second night. With some luck on the draws I managed to defeat him in 3 rounds with a couple of wounds on my hand at the end. I played on the easiest difficulty, and I don&#039;t think I would have won without those cards. Quite challenging and fun, but I still have to play a lot more to get better at playing this game, but is just so long.... :laugh: </body>

	<body>I spent all of yesterday evening (after working for 10 hours), setting up this one here. [floatleft][ImageID=2083738][/floatleft] This is my first COIN game and I&#039;m having a really hard time making myself play it. But it absolutely fascinates me. I keep coming back to this game and I do enjoy it. I only need to understand the rules better and play it more than just once in a while, so I won&#039;t start at the beginning every single time... Anyway, great experience and I&#039;m glad I bought this. Might just need more practice. At the moment its set up on the table and I&#039;m slowly going through the tutorial again.









Anyway. After all this, I needed something lighter, that plays quickly while getting dinner ready. So I brought out [thing=178613][/thing], which I bought in Essen last year mainly because of Suzys reports on this list. It was really cheap on the last day, so I brought it home with me, even though I&#039;m not really a Star Trek fan.

I&#039;d never played it yet (I mainly bought it to play it with a friend but somehow we never got round to it) but the rules are really simple and it was easy and quick to set it up while still checking on dinner once in a while. I went with the original series and played with three characters: Kirk, Spock and McCoy. 
Since it was my first go at the game, I went with the easy Ensign level, only needing 10 points for a win. At the beginning it was easy enough, but after a while and some very unlucky dice rolls, thinks were beginning to look pretty bad.
I was already at 9 points, so I only needed to complete one more scored alert. But I also was already at four failed alerts. Then I drew a new yellow alert, which also made me draw another red one. Which made me loose the game, since I now had five failed alerts.
[imageid=2889679large]
Fun game! I&#039;ll try to play this with some friends, should be more fun, but a nice filler and just the right thing to relax after tackling [thing=144189][/thing]!

:thumbsup: Easy rules, fun filler with lots of dice rolling.
:thumbsdown: Dice... they really don&#039;t like me. If you don&#039;t like games that depend mainly on luck, you won&#039;t like this one. Not many meaningful decisions to make in this game. </body>

	<body>First &quot;Learning&quot; game.

Kashmir scenario - Standard game

I decided to dip my toe into the Next War series with India-Pakistan. I have always been intrigued by future war/hypothetical conflicts. NW:Taiwan and NW:Korea did not seem all that interesting to me but NW:I-P did.

The Kashmir scenario is a good place to start. It&#039;s short (4 turns), light on unit count, and has the lowest rules overhead.

It took me about a week to play this short scenario because I would only play a little at a time which is good for me. There was constant rules referencing but that is to be expected from a heavier wargame. It did get easier as I played.

In the end Pakistan was victorious in taking back the &quot;disputed&quot; Kashmir territory with the help of few Airborne brigades of Chinese infantry.</body>

	<body>Well another discovery from the Guild.  Snowdonia!  I&#039;ve seen this game on the shelf at the FLGS for a few years and never bothered flipping the box (and see 1 - X players)

This was my initial play thru and I was pretty impressed with the game overall.  A solid worker placement.

:thumbsup: Worker placement
:thumbsup: Drawing resources from a bag
:thumbsup: Smart AI
:thumbsup: Weather effects are a neat addition to the game and require a little planning for the future
:thumbsup:Trains with the work Ticket or 18XX in the title
:thumbsup: available on Tabletop simulator
:thumbsup: Expansions galore!!!!
:thumbsdown: endgame when nothing but white cubes in the bag :( but this is probably my fault for not taking enough resources
:thumbsdown: The Pub doesn&#039;t serve Poutine ;)

This will hit the table again.</body>

	<body>I very much enjoy the Ameri-Trashy goodness of this game, but seldom get to play it multiplayer.  But hey, I&#039;m a solo gamer, so that shouldn&#039;t stop me!

Used the variant found here: [thread=211697][/thread].

It changes the complexion of the game a bit.  The three enemy factions don&#039;t have to worry about holding ground, gaining rubium or achieving objectives.  Their only goal is to push you off the moon.  Because they produce based on a die roll, it means they can crank out lava leapers and rubium dragons if the dice go their way.  This makes the solo variant a race to achieve your 12 points before getting crushed.

I never got my main units very far beyond my base, except for a quick dash to the monolith to pick up some energize cards.  The enemy AI is &quot;programmed&quot; to seek and destroy the nearest unit, so to buy myself time, I hopped off the monolith with a small force and invaded the opposite side of the board.  It didn&#039;t deter my close opponents, but it kept the units on the far side of the moon busy.  I scored the 12 points before getting overwhelmed.

	<body>Hi, this is my first time adding an item to the SGOYT list.

So far, I&#039;ve played three games of HN this month. Today&#039;s two games make this [comment=4419270]my first completed item in the 10 x 10 challenge.[/comment]

Today, I managed a win against Donna, in which 1 hostage died, but 12 were released/escaped alive. I went for conceding her major demand &quot;tenure award&quot;. I generally prefer not to make any concessions unless necessary, but this time it was too good an option to risk anything.

Then, I lost against Arkayne: 3 hostages were released, 4 died. If I had ended the game properly (i.e. as soon as more than half the hostages were dead), I&#039;d have saved only one hostage, but I like to play until the terror deck runs out or the abductor escapes, to try saving at least a few more meeple lives.

:thumbsdown: I think this game depends a bit more on luck than I would like. You can get incredibly lucky with both the terror cards and your dice rolls, or the opposite, with things just going horribly wrong all the time. I would prefer if skill mattered a little more than it appears to do. 
:thumbsup: Still, I like this one a lot. There is something that makes me come back again and again, and I&#039;m looking forward to playing against the third abductor from the base game, and to playing with the abductor packs. 
:thumbsup: I like the small footprint and relatively short play time. 
:thumbsup: The dice are good quality, the cards are functional and mostly very clear. Same goes for the board and wooden components.
:thumbsdown: I would have liked to see a female abductor that looks tough rather than goofy and crazy, but at least there is a female one at all.</body>

	<body>This game...it&#039;s quite addicting.  I packed up after my first game, stared at the box for an hour or so, then set it right back up for another go.  Played by the full solo rules this time, and it makes quite the difference starting off with one less resource, two fewer peasant moves, and only one defense. It was GRUELING just getting to a point where the darkness wouldn&#039;t overwhelm me.  Resources felt tighter in the full game, and building spots were at a premium...got to the point where I thought I would have to Remodel to keep up with my needs.  And the only change from the quick start and the full game event deck is the number of Viking attacks.  Two more attacks makes a world of difference, as the losses suffered happen that much more.

I scored 92 in this game, but afterwards double checked the rules around the Vikings.  Turns out I missed an important bit: you don&#039;t win against them if you tie for meeples an dice while fighting them.  I missed the word &quot;tie&quot;, so all the &quot;victories&quot; I &quot;had&quot; weren&#039;t &quot;real&quot;...I guess that last one didn&#039;t really need quotations... :shrug:

So, despite having three too many building and far too many cattle for how the Viking battles went (or maybe because of that), the game was fantastic.  Fan. Tast. Tic.  I can&#039;t wait to try some of the solo missions.  Next up: The Search for the Holy Grail.

	<body>Last night proved it to me, this game continues to be great but I can&#039;t put it on my one night table. I can only place it on my long term table which I can&#039;t really use until it is warmer then twenty degrees in my basement. I figured I would try with The Walking Dead coming back on today. Nothing quite like fending off tons of zombies!

:thumbsup: with the expansion pack the sheer variety is crazy. I like to play the standard Zeds campaign and the number of cards not used I think is great for replayability. 

:thumbsup: getting faster at setting up the deck and board over time.


:thumbsdown: I know I will end up being curious enough to want the third edition. </body>

	<body>I tried two more games of Imperial Settlers, once with Barbarians and once with the Romans.

I found out I did make a mistake in my first solo game, so my points there were a bit inflated. This time, I think I did everything right :)

The barbarian game went pretty solid, ended up at 73 points. A bit unlucky in  losing buildings to the enemy, but I got by.

Then my first solo game with the Romans. Boy, that plays differently :) I ended at 71, I don&#039;t think I found the real combo&#039;s yet as a lot of my points and income was dependant on common buildings. 

Still, great game, definately a keeper!</body>

	<body>I tried again with &quot;The Drifter&quot; investigator alone, but this time against the easiest Ancient One Yibb Tstll.
On the first attempt, I lasted 2 days before being devoured. This character is difficult to play alone, because he starts without items. If you draw difficult adventures at the beginning he has little chance to do anything.

Second attempt lasted a little longer (5 days), but quickly I had skills and spells which only apply to another investigator...so I could not use it  and decided to abort and play with two investigators.

So here I am, third game, this time with Michael Glenn the Gangster and Amanda Sharpe the Student, two items each and some powerful characteristics, against Yibb Tstll.
I tried two times to write down what was happening to make a detailed session report, but doing so I ended missing some rules (when writing, I always somehow manage to forget lingering mythos effect, or to draw an event card).

It&#039;s a pity because the game tells a nice story. Michael and Amanda were immediately cursed by Gypsies in the woods, and suffered from growing terror (3 dice locked in total). Amanda went to investigate in the Newspaper&#039;s building to find clues, but a portal opened right as she entered and she was lost in time and space without any hope to return, as she struggled in vain for 6 hours.
Michael tried to save her but failed too and now both investigators were lost, getting weaker without being able to recover. Hopefully at the second attempt, Amanda managed to find the way back to Arkham and closed the gate, freeing Michael.
Some time later, Amanda was lost in the woods, again with no way back, but not alone with a warlock she had to defeat. She failed one time and lost 3/4 of a day, then Michael tried to help her and failed too...the next day and the day after they kept fighting and searching for the way back, and finally succeeded after more than two and half days lost.

Finally, after butchering the rules twice, I did a third game with Amanda and Michael without taking notes and this time they succeeded, repelling the Ancient One with 12/12 Elder Signs vs 8/12 Doom Tokens.
They ended quite well equipped.

:thumbsup: First victory with GoA. The game delivered as expected!
I wish I could play without forgetting any effect while focusing only on the story. It seems possible with a little practice.</body>

	<body>Played the campaign game - and after being inspired by some recent discussion in the NW forums I chose to do so while ignoring the auto-win rules. To mix things up further I elected to use the Warrior Society tech cards which I tend to veer away from. I forced myself to start exploring their depths by putting Warrior Society #1 in play from the outset.

My decision to ignore auto-win proved immaterial during the first two ages (Spanish and Mexican) as I was never in a position where I would have been able to take advantage of that rule. I found both ages quite hard going and, despite my best intentions to play aggressively, I barely got the chance to take the fight to the Bilagaana. The raids invariably came straight after VP checks (when I&#039;d just lost all my AP) and I had to watch in frustration as the enemy steamrollered through my painstakingly created ambushes which I just didn&#039;t have the AP to activate. Still, it wasn&#039;t all bad. I found Warrior Society to be great when the Utes came raiding as I would keep a high-ferocity family stowed away somewhere to give the raiders a hiding. That provided a steady trickle of Military Points. I also took good advantage of the Adaptability tech cards from the expansion which proved to have great synergy with Warrior Society. Adaptability #1 allows the play to nerf the Enemy Way Effect of an in-hand Ceremony Card. This meant I was able to hold powerful Ceremony Cards (1s and 6s) until they were really needed without having to worry about all the nasty consequences that might ensue. Adaptability #2 allows the player to ignore an Enemy Ferocity increase which was just awesome because once my attacks did start to meet with success I could prevent the enemy from growing any stronger (thereby allowing me to stage another successful attack a few turns later).

Once the game reached the American era I really was holding all the aces. I had all six families in play, all three red cubes in the raid pool (thanks to a lucky run of minor events), no enemy ranchos and Enemy Ferocity at rock bottom. A single Passage of Time action would cause Enemy Morale to drop by two and Utes raids (of which there were plenty) were invariably worth 1 Military Point as my base strength was 6 (3 for ferocity, +1 for Warrior Society, +1 for Horse, +1 for Manuelito). After a dozen or so cards I had a crushingly dominant position with Enemy Morale at 0 and my Military Strength around 8 or 9. I played on until the Kit Carson event (just going through the motions really) and sealed my Major Win as that got resolved.

My thoughts? Well, the jury is still out on Auto-Win as Spain and Mexico proved to be surprisingly stubborn opponents. The American era certainly became a bit tedious once my position became so dominant but that is, I suppose, what auto-win tries to avoid. 

The big revelation was Warrior Society. I&#039;ve always thought it to be a pretty weak tech but it proved to be pretty awesome in this game - mainly because of the synergy with Adaptability. However I also had my eyes opened to the way in which Warrior Society becomes stronger in the Campaign Game - this tech is unique in that upgrades are paid for with Military Points (rather than Culture Points). This is quite a downside since Military Points are, in general, a lot harder to come by. However the transitional events in the Campaign Game instruct the player to set Military Points equal to Enemy Morale which means that a deficit at the end of any one era (perhaps caused by upgrading Warrior Society) need not be damaging since the transitional event will just write that deficit off.</body>

I am really beginning to love this game.
It&#039;s super fun, I&#039;d almost call it a filler, but some of these battles can go quite long. By far though, it is my favorite soloable dice game.


I&#039;ve been enjoying it so much, I ordered some commons/uncommon dice to round out the X-Men with Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Rogue. And I also picked up some Spidey villains: Kingpin, Doc Oc, and the Green Goblin.

The green goblin was where the problem occured. For each of the characters, I ordered a pair of the same dice, so I&#039;d have a pair for each new character. But the two Green Goblin dice were unmatched?!

The 45 cent common Green Goblin I ordered was missing!

[IMG]http://dicemastersdb.com/media/2359/asm139-rottinggoblin.jpg?roundedcorners=radius-10%7Cbgcolor-fff[/IMG]

They instead by accident sent me the [b]$50 SUPER RARE Rotting Goblin![/b] :surprise:

I was wondering why that one was in a protective sleeve. heh heh
Anyway, I contacted them and hopefully can get my $00.45 Green Goblin, and they can get their...

back. :laugh:

	<body>Another couple games playing the tutorial mission, finally got all rules right. 

Or... Not. Just as I finished playing I looked at the map, and realized I wasn&#039;t seeing things right! There&#039;s almost no street in this map! It&#039;s all inside buildings! How could I not see that :D

So, off to play it again tomorrow. Come to think of it the map layout makes much more sense now that I realized it was a bunch of interconnected buildings.

	<body>Have been experimenting with an AI for Ticket to Ride. While the digital implementation is good (the bots are a bit stupid at times though), it doesn&#039;t have all of the maps (yet), and the experience isn&#039;t the same as when playing with the physical sets. Using some of the learnings from my work-in-progress [thread=1519656]Dominion AI Project[/thread] I&#039;ve put together a &#039;generic&#039; bot for the physical version of TTR, and been testing it on the USA map, using the Mega variant from 1910, as that is my preferred way to play the map.

[ImageID=2890058 medium]

[ImageID=2884715 medium]

I&#039;ve gotten it to the point that I am happy enough with it&#039;s balance, and it is easy to scale a handicap for it (give it additional starting capacity, which has quite a bit of impact - I horribly lost the game where it started with capacity 2 on all it&#039;s tracks, even though that equates to only 4 extra turns and taking into account its limitations). Next step will be to use multiple copies of it and/or try a different map (which Europe will be the next logical step).

If anyone is interested in the discussion thread on it, it can be [thread=1523665]found here.[/thread]</body>

	<body>Finally got a chance to try this one, after playing the Battle the Horde a few weeks back.  And wow!  Can this one steamroll your face, if it gets going.  

Unlike the Horde deck, this one you don&#039;t get 3 turns to start (unless you modify the rules).  And you don&#039;t win by damaging/decking the Horde; you win by removing Xenagos, the starting god card, from the field.  The only catch: you can&#039;t remove/kill him until all of his little minions are gone.  And he starts with 2 on the field (or 3 if you&#039;re feeling brave).  And they reproduce like crazy.  And his sorceries - MAN his sorceries - can rip you apart, too.  

Anyways, let me get to the games...

[b]Game 1 - Mono-green[/b]: I got absolutely DESTROYED playing with this deck. I thought with my regenerating River Boas, my Leatherback Baloths (4/5 for GGG), regenerating Albino Trolls, and Overruns (among others), that I might stand a chance.  Nope.  Xenagos and his minions killed me on their 3rd turn, with 3 Rollicking Throngs, 2 Ecstatic Pipers, and 1 Pheres-Band Reveler on the field alongside him.  I mean it wasn&#039;t even close.  I think I killed 2 of his minions.  Gave a new meaning to the term &quot;GET REKT.&quot;

[b]Game 2 - Mono-White (aka &quot;White Weenie&quot;)[/b]: perhaps one of my favorite decks of all time, I decided to go with my trusted noble companions, the Warriors of Light.  This first game of 3, I got the vengeance I was seeking, winning pretty easily by the 5th turn with 23 life left (Soul Wardens, plus slaying several Ecstatic Pipers, boosted my life up over the starting total).  I had Xenagos begging for mercy.

[b]Game 3 - Mono-White[/b]: My gloating didn&#039;t last long.  Xenagos and his minions got their (deserved) revenge, crushing me by the 6th turn with 7 Revelers left on the battlefield.  The card &quot;Rip to Pieces&quot; did just that: it RIPPED me and my feeble weenies to pieces.  What does it do, you may ask?  Only this: deals damage to each player and creature equal to the number of Revelers on the field.  And, well, since there were 7, it pretty much wiped my board and smashed my face for 7.  This game wasn&#039;t pretty.  I knew I needed a 3rd rubber match between these Warriors and the Xenagos army, to determine once and for all who the true Champions were...

[b]Game 4 - Mono-White[/b]: A fitting, nitty-gritty, down to the wire kind of game.  At first I was off to a good start, but several Rollicking Throngs combined with some direct damage from Xenagos&#039; Strike and Impulsive Destruction made this one quite close.  I won with only 7 life left, which was really only 5 the turn before, but boosted by a final turn kill of an Ecstatic Piper (along with a Rollicking Throng and Xenagos himself).  I have to say, too, that the ending was sweet justice: I Oblivion Ringed Xenagos to finish him off!  It was pretty epic.

Well, I think I&#039;m off to try my luck again with the Mono-Green, and then maybe my Red-Green...FEAR ME XENAGOS!!!

[i]UPDATE[/i]

[b]Game 5 - Mono-Green[/b]: I did it!  Pulled off a victory by the skin of my teeth.  Didn&#039;t have a great starting hand, and I thought I was done initially, but somehow won with 3 life left.  The Xenagos army actually had me down to 1, as i decided not to chump block Xenagos, so as to keep my extra potential attacker.  Then I cleared off a few of his Revelers, followed by a turn in which I then chump blocked Xenagos with a 2/2 Mongrel.  Then I ended it with vengeance via an Overrun, smashing his lone Reveler (Piper, I think), and then trampling his face for 7.  

[b]Game 6 - Mono-Green[/b]: Again!  This time with 2 life left.  1st turn Arbor Elf followed by turn 2 and 3 Leatherback Baloths certainly helped.  I just had to hold on long enough to be able to use them...had to chump with another Arbor Elf 4th turn...then I finished them off on the 5th!

[b]Game 7 - Red/Green[/b]: Despite access to Lightning Bolts and Burst Lightnings (of which I of course received NONE), this game resulted in turn 5 death.  Rip to Pieces, along with an attacking Xenagos all but one turn, utterly thrashed me.  Gonna have to try it again :cry:

[b]Game 8 - Red/Green[/b]: Revenge was had!  Won with 9 life left.  My Erhnam Djinn (4/[b]5[/b]) was the PERFECT counter to the 2 Pheres-Band Revelers (4/[b]4[/b]) that were on the battlefield.  Fortunately for me, by the time an Impulsive Charge came along (allowing all Revelers to attack), my Djinn had finished them both off, and Xenagos&#039; army was only able to attack with a few Rollicking Throngs...

Since I&#039;m now yawning and second guessing a few things, I think I&#039;ll pack it in for the night...but man am I glad I went ahead and ordered this Challenge Deck!  I enjoy it much more than the Horde one...now I only need to pick up the OoP Hydra deck.  

G&#039;night y&#039;all! And game on :laugh:</body>

	<body>So, um, this game kind of got away from me this evening. My wife was watching Downton etc and I forgot to eat. I just had some cereal now, so you all needn&#039;t worry. Now we&#039;re watching the super hilarious Jimmy Fallon Valentine&#039;s special together.

Anyhow, I decided to try no buy rounds since I had been doing so well with just one. It&#039;s a big difference. I think the buying strategies need to be different. Like, I almost think you need to tank the first 2 games to get your deck humming. Here are the scores:

Phillies vs San Francisco
Game 1:
6-5 Win!
2-7 Loss
0-4 Loss
7-0 Win!
1-11 Loss
8-1 Win!
0-1 Loss in extra innings!

So, that was incredibly epic and I ventured to play some more games. They were less than epic:
Game 2:
4-10 Loss
2-3 Loss
3-4 Loss
8-11 Loss 2 extra innings

Game 3: 
6-9 Loss
5-8 Loss
2-4 Loss
5-8 Loss

So, given their poor performance the Phillies were given some first round draft picks ;) I went to 1 buy round:
Game 4: 
6-5 Win!
5-3 Win!
8-6 Win!
9-7 Win in 4 extra innings!

That one went way too well, and there really weren&#039;t any dangerous AI cards. So, I decided to go again with 1 buy round and it was much better:

Game 5: 
5-4 Win!
6-7 Loss in 1 extra inning
8-9 Loss in 4 extra innings (but this let me get Max Verlander :cool:
6-3 Win!
6-3 Win!
4-3 Win!

So, I&#039;m not sure what to make of it. I can usually win with one buy round, but get absolutely stomped by 0 buy rounds. As I mentioned above, I suspect a strategy change is in order. This is still a deck builder after all. That first game was soooooo close. I lost by 1 run in extra innings. That was really epic, but I think parts of it had to do with bad shuffling because there were some cards that were just poor choices for the AI, which kept coming up in the same game. Then all the bad ones (for me) kept coming up together. You can see that in the swingy scores. 

Still, I had a ton of fun, and now have nourishment, so that&#039;s good. </body>

	<body>This arrived yesterday, it&#039;s now on the table, I&#039;m a way into mission 1, I&#039;m having a blast!

Like the hand size as health mechanic, makes tracking hit points easy, the constant spawning of monsters makes it feel like a never ending tide, every one you kill will come back at the end of the turn.

Had a great moment where my Close Combat guy was down to one card in hand and I foolishly decided to search an empty spawn point with him, yep drew an ambush which attacked him.  The Infected Animal rolled ... 1 hit!  Discard last card but not knocked down, teamamtes are able to get to the area and kill monster before it activates at the end of the turn. Phew!  We live to keep fighting.</body>

	<body>Man this year has been busy...  I&#039;ve had two, two-week stints of zero gaming.  Maybe I picked a bad year to start a 10x10 hardcore challenge :shake:.  Oh well, I digress.

Up to this point, I&#039;ve only played LE: Alien with a single avatar. I&#039;ve been able to clear all the movie scenarios that way besides Resurrection, which has given me a tough time. I decided to give two-handed play a go so I could utilize the Coordinate mechanic and see how I liked it. I started at the beginning with the Alien scenario on the Nostromo, using the Mercenary and Gunner avatars (drawn randomly). On the Gunner&#039;s second turn, he exposed an event card causing both avatars to draw a Strike -- a flesh wound for the Merc and a Facehugger for himself. The Merc couldn&#039;t clear the Facehugger so the Gunner ended up dying soon after from the inevitable Chestburster. So much for my two-handed game! The Merc was eventually able to pull out a win drawing the exact damage needed to kill the Perfect Organism who had just entered the airlock. On to the next scenario!

[center][ImageID=2890634medium][/center]

For the Aliens scenario in Hadley&#039;s Hope, I replaced the dead Gunner with the Priest (again, drawn randomly) and kept the Merc. I had the Merc focus on Strength and Tech cards and the Priest focus on Survival and Leadership. The &quot;Vigilant&quot; mechanic on the cards related to this scenario is pretty interesting -- you can use the cards with this keyword to combo during your turn as normal, but save their effects for a later turn. I wasn&#039;t keeping up to well on clearing aliens from the complex, which led to me exposing the Queen (third objective) before I had the second sentry gun (second objective) in place. The Queen was pushed into the combat zone which put me on a very tight timeline to kill her, as she hits two avatars with strikes. The Merc was able to gather 11 of the 12 damage needed to put her down and the Priest couldn&#039;t assist, so the Queen made quick work of them both.

I kinda like the idea of attempting to play through the movies as a campaign and resetting on a TPK.  At least, I say that now.  

Both [thing=146652]LE: Alien[/thing] and [thing=135382]Shadowrun: Crossfire[/thing] have been filling the little time I have for gaming this month.  They are both quick to set up and also make for quick repeat plays.  Alien is a bit less tense and thinky but a lot more thematic, and I love the persistence of Crossfire (so close to me 20 Karma upgrades!)  The art in both games is great too.  My employer gave us President&#039;s Day off this year, so maybe I&#039;ll be able to find the time tomorrow to get something a bit more heavy in.  I&#039;ve had both [thing=96848]Mage Knight[/thing] and [thing=42776]Gears of War[/thing] sitting on my dining room table taunting me since Friday.  

Oh yeah, was excited to see this when I woke up as well:

[twitter=https://twitter.com/BoardGameGeek/status/698860957615972352/]

Curious to see what&#039;s in the box!  (Hopefully some Vasquez cards.)

that&#039;s embarrassing.

Robot&#039;s Damaged Alien Factory - 67

Basically had no economy. Going military always fails me.

Another play! I thought I was going to be crazy and try &quot;Hard&quot;, but about halfway through, I knocked the bot down to easy since it still hadn&#039;t grabbed the second VP tile.

Still got slaughtered. I scored a 23 to the robot&#039;s I don&#039;t even know.

I know you&#039;re supposed to adapt to the draw in this game, but I really think this play was a case of bad cards. I got NO production early on and then when I did it was only windfall production for worlds that were nowhere to be seen. I had zilch to work with.

Yeah yeah... I know... excuses excuses.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing more multiplayer games lately (and doing some RPG sessions), but I&#039;m at long last starting to get some more solitaire games to my table.

A few weeks ago Victory Point Games reached out to see if I would be interested in looking at a late beta copy of Darkest Night 2nd Edition. I was surprised they asked considering I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of the 1st edition (I only played the base game). I think it&#039;s a solid design, it just fell flat for me as a solo experience.

I got a package yesterday and double-checked the info VPG sent me to make sure the embargo has been lifted on posting pics and thoughts. It has, and I can now show you the insane amount of content that came in the late beta kit.

Note that the art on this stuff isn&#039;t final, but it is a phenomenal upgrade from the first edition in terms of art quality and overall graphic design. VPG has been killing it with these new Premium line editions.

Also note that they included stuff in the kit that may not be included in the Kickstarter, as several elements are still being tested. There is some preliminary nfo about what the Kickstarter will involve in terms of content but I&#039;d rather wait for VPG to make official announcements than repeat any of it here.

29 characters were included in the box they sent. 29. That&#039;s a staggering amount of potential combos to experiment with. Here are all the character cards before sorting:

[imageid=2890744 medium]

And after sorting, along with the stacks of Map, Event, Artifact, Quest, and Darkness cards, plus the colorful new character mats:

[imageid=2890745 medium]

And the new map. It&#039;s big, lovely, and evocative of theme. I wasn&#039;t a fan of the cramped and dark map in the 1st edition but this is fantastic:

[imageid=2890746 medium]

I&#039;m looking forward to revisiting this as I always wondered if I would have liked it more with the expansion content and now I have a chance to find out.

Here&#039;s a better shot of the game set up for play:

The third try on [b]Journey down the Anduin.[/b]

I think Peter Jackson got it wrong...pretty sure the real Anduin looks like this:

[IMG]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Slum_and_dirty_river.jpg/640px-Slum_and_dirty_river.jpg[/IMG]

Dirty awful river keeps smiting all my heroes.

My heroes were so wealthy, I ran out of resource tokens. I had to use damage tokens.

And GANDALF!

[IMG]https://jrphoel.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/rb-gandalf.jpg[/IMG]

Let me tell you about Gandalf. They always show him as this kindly old man. Well the truth is...

[IMG]http://yhm.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sid-e-nancy-coluna-dallas1.jpg[/IMG]

GANDALF IS A PUNK!

I had three Gandalfs in my deck. And he never showed!


We wuz threated out.

Last year, I beat Anduin once. I remember it was some awesome lucky evening. But the last three goes have been terrible. So, I&#039;m moving on to The Search for Gollum.

	<body>Played against a team of villains from [thing=134398][/thing]. With this expansion there are villains that fight as a team instead of individually. Instead of one villain with a turn at the beginning of the round, you have a number of villains equal to the heroes who alternate turns with the heroes.

[imageid=2890791 large]

Played against Baron Blade, Fright Train and Proletariat.

[imageid=2890792 large]

[imageid=2890793 large]

[imageid=2890794 large]

My hero team was Sky Scraper, who can change size from huge to normal to tiny, Guise, who is an homage to Deadpool, and Parse who is a hacker that tampers with other decks in the game.

[imageid=2890798 large]

Played in The Enclave of Endlings, an environment filled with creatures that are the last of their kind. A tribute to the art of Jack Kirby.

[imageid=2890799 large]

The first to fall was Fright Train, taken out by Parse.

[imageid=2890801 large]

Then Baron Blade KO&#039;d Sky Scraper.

[imageid=2890802 large]

Then Guise managed to take out Proletariat.

[imageid=2890804 large]

One of the creatures from the Enclave of Endlings took out Parse, and then another creature, The Last Kabran, took out Baron Blade.

[imageid=2890805 large]

That left only Guise still standing, with a measly 4 HP, but it was enough for a victory for the heroes. Awesome!

[imageid=2890808 large]

Guise is an interesting hero to play (and appropriate on the weekend that Deadpool opens at the theatres). He has a lot of cards that only last one turn but with powerful effects (all of them based on pop culture tropes like &quot;The Gritty Reboot&quot; and &quot;Jumping the Shark&quot;).</body>

	<body>My first play of this GMT classic. Played scenario one, featuring the Russians and Germans both on reconnaissance looking to find and hold a key crossroads. I played both sides, but used a sideboard of 3 cards for each side. Whenever I had to check the other side&#039;s hand for op fire etc., after I would shuffle in the three sideboard cards and then redeal the hand to keep both continuity and mystery as I switched sides.

The Russians grabbed the key objective, a house by the crossroads, first, while the Germans grabbed the other key objective in the treeline. The second team of Russians made their way up from the south and approached the Germans in the trees.

[imageid=2890810 large]

After a bloody melee, the Russians now held the house and the treeline.

[imageid=2890813 large]

The Germans spent some time pinned down in a barn just NW of the key house held by the Russians. They managed to recover some of their units and they mustered their forces for a desperate all out charge and melee attack.

[imageid=2890816 large]

[imageid=2890814 large]

Success! 

[imageid=2890817 large]

Bolstered by their victory, a group of Germans charged from the house to the treeline to take on the Russians who were firing upon them.

[imageid=2890818 large]

With another bloody victory in melee combat, the Germans now controlled access to the crossroads.

[imageid=2890819 large]

A few scattered Russian units attempted to charge the house, but were cut down by German gunfire. Enough Russians were lost that they surrendered the crossroads to the Germans. 

[imageid=2890820 large]

Glad I picked up this game. It was in the People&#039;s Choice Top 100 Solo Games, but doesn&#039;t seem to show up on SGOYT very often. I am hoping to fix that. Thoroughly enjoyed my first play.</body>

	<body>I tried [thing=170390][/thing] before and enjoyed the Nap 20 system. I think it is a great introductory wargame system. So, I bought Fading Glory.

Even though the game is 2 player, it is very easy to solo. There are no hidden information unless you use the optional fog of war rules.

Fading Glory has 4 games in one. I started with Waterloo 20. The components are classic GMT quality, i.e. they are awesome. The rules are simple, the player aids are good enough that you don&#039;t need to refer to the rulebook often.

I played two games, the first one ended up with a very early French defeat. The second one lasted longer but the French guard managed to hold their ground and secured the victory.

:thumbsup: Easy rules
:thumbsup: Very few counters, so it is a great game to introduce people to wargames, yet still, every turn presents a great puzzle.
:thumbsup: Perfect for solo play.
:thumbsdown: Not much to criticize.</body>

	<body>[thing=179572]Dice City[/thing] is a dice allocation game, and cards are &quot;purchased&quot; to create a player&#039;s city. It reminds me a bit of [thing=27162]Kingsburg[/thing].

I played 5 games solo using the official solitaire variant from the rulebook. I played the first two games at the &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty level, then finding it too easy to win (60, then 69 points), I switched to the &quot;Hard&quot; level which is just a very minor rules change but makes the game more difficult to win. Solitaire is basically a &quot;beat your high score&quot; game, but there is enough variation in gameplay that it has kept my interest so far. According to the rulebook, the score to beat is 50, but it recommends raising the level by 5-point increments if it gets too easy.  My scores at the &quot;Hard&quot; level so far:  49, 45, and 48.


EDIT: I played another 5 games at the solo &quot;hard&quot; difficulty level, and finally won one at the level!  

Anyway, I&#039;m counting this game toward my Normal 10 x 10 Challenge:

	<body>[i]Disclaimer: The title I posted this under is somewhat inaccurate.  While the game-play rules and counter components do come from the Wings of Glory WW2 Starter Set the planes are from the Series 1 expansion and the mat is a more recent offering for Wings.  I kept the images small to conserve space but the planes look more interesting larger, so click away![/i]

February 14, 1942
Two Wildcats on island patrol from a near-by carrier encounter a pair of Zekes heading straight for them with the sun at their backs.

[imageid=2890903]

There is no turning away from this one for the lieutenant and his wingman. Lt. McWhorter was flying a new F4F-4 model that was a superior plane but his wingman and rookie pilot Tom Riddle was in an older FM-1 so this was going to be a tough fight.  At a signal by the Lt. both pilots went into a maneuver sequence they had practiced but never tried in combat. The American planes looked like they were slowing and moving to the left of the Japanese.  Then they suddenly both went full throttle and barreled in guns trained on the Zeke closest to Riddle.

[imageid=2890905]

The Japanese got the best of the first pass, hitting both targets including a shot that temporarily jammed McWorther&#039;s rudder.  Luckily, the second part of the maneuver sequence did not require the plane to turn.  By making a risky frontal attack and taking some hits with their better armored planes the Americans hoped to circumvent the Zeke&#039;s superior turning capability with an Immelmann turn.

When the American pilots completed their maneuver they found the Japanese planes had split and furious pursuit and evasion ensued.  After several passes one of the Japanese planes and the American Wingman were damaged to the point that they were spewing oil (2 and 1 damage left) so they broke off toward the ocean to try to get an advantage on the other.  At the same time McWorther decided it was time to even things up.

[imageid=2890914]

Riddle attempted to approach the enemy from an advantageous position but the Japanese pilot would not allow it so they both fired on each other head on... no everyone can be an Ace but luck can also be sieved like opportunity and this fight would see the damaged Wildcat still in the sky.

[imageid=2890917]

Lt. McWorther executed another Immelmann followed by a furious maneuver to get an angle on the other Zeke and put him square in his sights for the kill.

[imageid=2890920]

The two American pilots flew away not suspecting what would occur only a few months later in the same air space above Midway Island...</body>

	<body>So, it&#039;s taken a couple of views of Ricky Royal&#039;s videos, along with Ava&#039;s (and a creamy hit of Ritalin to take the edge off), but I [i]think[/i] I&#039;ve started playing this correctly now.

Or, at least, correctly enough to really enjoy it. 

Baseball Highlights really was, last year, (intentional grammatical typo is intentional) and I think this would have been rated more highly if there weren&#039;t rules issues (i.e. the designers cut some of the solo explanation out of the rulebook, as space was an issue - and we&#039;re still awaiting a full version to appear). As someone who is a little mystified by the sport, I didn&#039;t have a clue how to play this from what was in the box. Only upon reading around did I discover that even fans of the game were scratching their heads a bit. 

Anyhow... this really is a great little game. I&#039;ve got the two expansion rosters already (yet to play with the Sentinels cast). There&#039;s luck of the dice, with some mitigation, and the AI deck is a smart substitute for a bluffing human opponent. It does work, as it should, once you&#039;ve got to grips with the design. 

Just played two games: lost the first but won the second - and I&#039;m starting to see the additional strategies at work (such as batting order, when to push a fatigue), and there&#039;s a lot of traits to consider. It really is a lot of fun - and I&#039;d love to see an expansion to the event deck, if it can be done without unbalancing the AI opponent. 

I&#039;ve sworn of the 10x10 challenge this year, as it turned fun into graft, last time, but if I hadn&#039;t this would easily have made the list. It&#039;s really well done.

This past weekend I ran into WMTtE designer [person=41521][/person] at a local con in LA.  Seeing Steve reminded me that I hadn&#039;t played WMTtE lately.  Naturally, I had to pull it out for another go-round.

Unfortunately, nobody had to tell the Emperor anything, he could look out of the Imperial Palace and see a bunch of US Marines demanding entry just 7 cards into the mid-War deck.

Where was the glorious IJN?  Far from the Home Islands, having knocked out both Wavell AND Mac, and were attempting to do the same to the Chinese.

That&#039;s how it goes when you try for a Military Victory, EVERY die roll has to go towards the 3 fronts you are trying to knock out.  Nimitz gets a free ride and the clock is ticking, tic, tock, BbbbbbbbbbOOM!</body>

The first one I ended up with a windmill built by Papa which helped but I still lost the game - even with the 8 round variant.

The second one I had a tasting room built but no money so that really did not help at all.  The tasting room doesn&#039;t really do anything without having wine in the cellar.  My first grapes drawn already required the irrigation and the trellis so I was behind before even starting.

Anyway still enjoying the game - even played two player version twice teaching another person the game and he really likes it as well.</body>

	<body>Going for the 10 scenarios in the [thing=142585][/thing] expansion for the next 15 days.

Scenario 1 was already published to death on the BGG pages.

But here is the final shot of a not too difficult win this time:

[imageid=2891350]

My Russians took the Control Point and the German AI was reduced to one Sdkfz. 

-----------------------------

Scenario 2 is the famous T34 battle against German Inf that need to protect supply wagons.

Slipping through my defenses was a first T34 that fell into my trap of Pioneers. 

[imageid=2891359large]

I had some luck as before the T34 could hit the Supply Wagon his Fire Power got knocked out. The Tank was hit a second time and killed.

[imageid=2891367large]

A second T 34 infiltrated and just as he was going to blast a supply wagon, the ... movement card for the Wagon was pulled and so the AI fired on the adjacent target (mortar unit), killing it, but at the same time I could crawl up with my Tank Hunter from behind.

[imageid=2891375large]

Another luck: the attack immobillized the T34 :)

[imageid=2891384large]

The battle was not over yet: The immobilized T34 killed my Tank Hunter unit and started fire on the closing Infantry and Supply Wagon in its rear ! By a miracle the shots missed the Wagon but did hit the Pioneers that ... GOT BERSERK.

[imageid=2891394large]

Of course my berserk troops did NOT have mercy on that T34 and on the next turn I put an &quot;immobilized (card) counter for this turn&quot; on the last surviving T34.
Putting smoke on the road by an upfront Pioneer unit, the game was locked and went for a sure win.

[imageid=2891402large]

With 4 VP I made sure I played through the deck of cards without further risks.

Satisfying play in what can be sometimes a very difficult scenario to beat.

This IS a great SOLO WW2 tactical game, and it is a breath of fresh air versus other wargames with their usual 59 pages of rules to ... start things.

No hastle with self made rules to play solitaire either: it is all included into the system.

Solo gaming at its best.</body>

	<body>My first go at Volcano Island ended when my little party died.... of starvation. I think this is the first time I ever lost for that reason. 

When I initially broke this out, it had been a while. I had decided to use Universal Head&#039;s rule summary rather than the one I&#039;ve been using for years and was more used to. UH&#039;s summary is amazing but can be a little more difficult to navigate. 

Upon reading the changed rules for the scenario, I was feeling a mite confused. There&#039;s a table that&#039;s hard to grok upon first sight; it&#039;s only 3 columns and two rows, but what the heck does that mean? 2/3/4 are the column headers, does that mean round numbers? It took me a bit to realize that it actually meant player count. D&#039;oh!

The scenario essentially tells you that you have to explore a certain number of tiles, there&#039;s a whopping volcano tile in the middle of the map (which is just impassable mechanically), and certain tiles become destroyed as the game goes on so you need to keep moving. Additionally, tiles with totems need to be explored for victory conditions..... and all exploration actions require +1 pawns assigned to them. Yeah. So basically, the map was a must-build immediately. The scenario also has a specific invention that can also be used for exploring the totem tiles. 

It&#039;s a REALLY tough scenario. I&#039;m going to have to tackle it again. I will say that the game is still an amazing design and experience. I love Pandemic and other co-ops but this really feels like an adventure. 

The only downside is that I loved the purity of the castaways scenario. That felt like the main system. Everything else feels like a scenario where you&#039;re pushed to do something, whereas castaways felt the most like a sandbox. I wonder if there&#039;s an experienced variant for it where the book icon does something. 

I look forward to finishing the scenarios and jumping into the Beagle expansion! I also hold out hope for Scenario 6 of the base game, which looks like it can be another sandbox scenario.</body>

	<body>My first post to SGoYT.  This group has really changed how I think and feel about gaming.  Until recently, my solo plays have been mainly fake-2p rules runthroughs, followed by multi-player game hopes that often didn&#039;t materialize.

Now, rather than feel bitter about gaming not fitting well into my schedule, I have some solo projects to keep me busy: [thing=159675]Fields of Arle[/thing], [thing=39683]Loyang[/thing], [thing=875][/thing] scenarios, [thing=96848]Mage Knight[/thing], and this one...

[imageid=2891487medium]

[thing=156007][/thing].

I grew up in Circleville, Ohio, whose streets were initially patterned after Native American earthworks, and so I&#039;ve had my eye on this one for a while.  I&#039;ve posted the game state at the end of Hopewell Era, so that if you&#039;ve played it you can see what misery is in store for me.  I feel vaguely overextended, but who knows.  

Update: Between the Hopewell and Mississippian Eras, the entire region was attacked by the Great Enemy of Board Gaming, our cat.  

[imageid=2898159medium]

Luckily, I had recorded the game state, so I was able get on with the Mississippian Era... which I did not make it out of.

[imageid=2898163medium]

Ultimately, the Ho-Chunk warpath did me in.  Once I got the hang of the flow of the turns, things moved along quickly, and I really enjoyed the game, despite not being much of a wargamer.</body>

	<body>I own the 2nd edition, which I prefer, but 1st edition fits in my coat pocket and, wouldn&#039;t you know it, I was out somewhere and had an hour to kill while waiting for my wife. I found a table and got to work.

Last couple of times I played, I finally mastered the basic game by dropping prophecies like it was biblical. So this time, I went for Book of Steps Lost and Found.

What I really like about this expansion are the spells. They helped me tremendously and I achieved a win fairly easily, about on par with how I would in the base game. I enjoyed it but it didn&#039;t feel like a huge step up. I know many combine this with the Glyphs expansion from 2nd edition, but that wasn&#039;t an option.

I then decided to try the Towers expansion. I&#039;ve heard this one&#039;s tough but varying opinions on how good it is. Well, I lost. However, I must not have shuffled the cards well because I was pulling out a TON of sun cards, with very few moon cards. Meaning I had to keep discarding cards or, eventually, abandoning the current door color and try something new (very risky). Had to do this a few times.

I lost when a nightmare made me discard the 3rd blue tower. Looking at it, though, I realized I could never have placed it down because the tower before it had a moon on its right side and ALL the blue towers have a moon on their left side. That&#039;s something I need to consider for next time. 

The Towers is difficult but I liked it. Gonna give it a shot again.</body>

	<body>First win! :laugh:

I finally managed to win one game, this time I decided to try with Donna, and I think the luck was on my side this afternoon. Even if she increased the hostage pool to 15 in total, I managed to keep her calm all the way to the end, and thanks to some help on the inside, I managed to grab some precious extra time, enough to save almost all of them and make her surrender.

What a little gem of a game :)

PS: While I was playing this, I also had my eye on a bid for Gears of War, which I managed to get, even if I went a bit over what I wanted (£72). I expect to like it after what I&#039;ve read here, but if not I could always sell it for about the same price. I&#039;ll be asking recommendations and advice on that soon :laugh:</body>

	<body>Two more goes on Imperial Settlers, both with Egyptians. They didn&#039;t agree with me, scored 67 and 53. More practice required!

:thumbsup: I like how you slowly get better cards, as you move on from the Core to the expansions.
:thumbsdown: This game can be quite brutal, even in Easy Mode.
:thumbsup: So far out of 4 different scenarios, they all play quite a bit differently.
:thumbsup: The different decks Lore, Tactics, etc... have different play styles, strengths, and weaknesses. (I really miss the healing of Lore in my Leadership/Spirit deck.)

	<body>Another play of this very good, well balanced game. It always feels so epic, playing out an entire season/cup tournament. I win this game on overall points quite often, but don&#039;t manage to win the season or the cup that much and have never won both. 

My usual difficulty is 2/2 for neutral team strength and neutral team games but this time I bumped them to 3/3. 

I had a very hard time building a squad early in the season but by the mid-point I had a nice team that was competing. Our first cup game was against the 1st place team in the league and we lost a heart-breaking game 0(2)-0(5) on penalties. 

The heartbreak would repeat on the last day of the season where I was playing the 2nd place team for 2nd place overall. I had been getting used to clean sheets with 0-0, 7-0 and 3-0 results in my last few games. We ended up getting convincingly clobbered 7-1 in the last game. 

Final score was 
   Red: 43 (winner of league and cup) 
   Yellow: 32  (2nd place in league) 
   Blue/ ME : 28 
   Purple: 25 (cup runner up) 
   Green: 23 
   Black: 15

	<body>Played the Lost! Scenario with 4 characters: Ned, Phil, Josh and Amy. They got split off from the rest of their group in an unfamiliar side of town. There were a lot of buildings so they figured they would grab some supplies and get out..
They decided to enter the first large building, and immediately enter into a you-know what storm as they saw two fatties marking their way towards them..they did a quick search and found some ammo but decided to double back and check the building closer to the exit as they noticed more and more zombies piling up...
They found what they needed, but a whole heard of Fatties and runners made their way towards the group. Amy flung a Molotov and thought she cleared a path, but as she made her exit, she was surround and went down in a blaze of glory. In the meantime Josh got to greedy and went off to search some more. He ran into a fatty and swung at him with his ax, but missed and Josh was just another meal for the fat bastard.
At this point Ned and Phil were making headway out of the building towards the exit, Phil made it out, and Ned almost made it but a stray runner caught him and it was goodbye Ned. Phil was going to have to carry as much as he could and make his way back to the rest of the group which as time wnet on was getting smaller and smaller....</body>

	<body>So, this has been waiting to properly hit the table for some weeks now. I had to wait a while for a component to arrive but, glancing through the rules from time to time, I was getting more and more excited to play. 

The game has a dedicated solo mode, but I thought I&#039;d play it four-handed, first, to get a feel for the differences. Its theme is interesting: based on a series of Polish (I think) novels, players are four human scientists who have traveled from Earth to the realm of Midgaard. Once here, of course, our developed ways and science make us weave havoc throughout the land - leading us to conquer the local peasants and turn our magic, our summoned minions, and our weaponry, against our former allies. 

[i]Oh, sorry, no... That&#039;s a page from David Cameron&#039;s guide to ethical foreign policy. Not sure how that got in the rulebook. [/i]

Ahem. 

So, reading the backstory in the manual, if not being aware of the literature, it&#039;s apparent that you play as an absolute sociopathic prick (one of the four even kidnaps children and turns them into Crab-men soldiers). The solo game abridges the main rules slightly, which is why I&#039;ll try it this way first, as a comparison, but I&#039;m happy to say the rules aren&#039;t too bad - even if the game feels heavy - and I&#039;m enjoying my tentative opening moves. It&#039;s unusual to have something like this be playable for one; there&#039;s shades of the Game of Thrones boardgame here, and the theme has definitely wandered away from Tolkein tropes. Feels really different to anything that&#039;s come before. There&#039;s also an automated antagonist in the shape of Vuko, a human sent to initially rescue the stranded scientists, but then moved to take them down. He targets the player with the worst reputation at the end of each round. 

Hey, even the board is double-sided: one is lighter and more summery (see below); the other is a little greyer (I think I prefer it). There&#039;s an awful lot to like here - wrangling over initiative and turn order; area control; combat; developing and deploying units; randomised set-up; tweaking the economic systems of the three currencies; action selection; three sets of end-game conditions, including an asynchronous goal for each - assuming the solo rules retain the fun of the main game, this is going to be great.

	<body>Well, been a while but so glad these challenges are back.

Thanks [user=shaungamer][/user] .  If you haven&#039;t been a part of his Star Realms or Rallyman challenges then you are missing out on the finest solo set ups out there.

I had a quick set up and total trouncing of the Dark Pirates. Was able to finish them off in 6, 7 and 7 rounds. Got some lucky draws for good cards in the offer and then flipped merc cruiser twice which was way to my advantage.

After playing these three games though I got to go outside, start a fire and play a few games of roll for it with my daughter Samantha.

	<body>Since my time was limited, and as much as I wanted to break out Liberty and Death again, I decided instead to pull this one out. I managed two games and... and... and...

Well, the first game was just bad dice, I had a decent enough start but a double advance on the Ho-chunk track had them destroy the palisade at Cohika. The next two turns brought the pressure and ended with the Ho-chunk in my house ending the game with a Decisive Defeat at -30 points... ouch.

My second game I felt as focused as a laser, despite a short trip to happy hour (!)... I dug into game number two after dinner. I started out with a nice buffer and managed to hold my enemies off until the Spanish arrived. After a few relentless advances I stopped the Spanish advance, shuffled the card back into the deck... and faced the Spanish again. In hindsight, this was probably the best outcome. I had a great board position and having to handle a few more events before facing them again might have weakened my position further.  I wrapped the game with a score of 24 for a major victory, my first with this game.

	<body>[b]Update 17 February[/b]

I just deleted everything I wrote in this space yesterday. I did a little bit of griping. Turns out I played a very key rule very incorrectly. This invalidates my prior complaint and made tonight&#039;s play much more fun.

[b]NOTE[/b]: Don&#039;t treat the time track like a turn track. It&#039;s not a turn track. Only advance the time marker when you get a time event or deplete your fate deck. My bad.

So I realized this as I was setting up and refreshing on some rules. Got to playing and had a much better time. I didn&#039;t complete the Grassy Knoll scenario as I realized I had made a few small errors throughout the game and it was getting late. But way more fun this time. Lots of long distance firefights as the Americans and their Philippino allies advanced toward the defending Japanese. The Americans used a lot of smoke and were able to use a couple timely White Phosphorus events to cover their approach and mitigate damage.

Looking forward to playing it again. I was able to grok a lot of the rules and gameplay tonight.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been trying to crawl out of an emotional sinkhole coupled with PTSD flashbacks for the past several days, and generally feel that I am a terrible human being who doesn&#039;t deserve friends or a good life or any good things at all. 

Be that as it may, I found a nice mechanism for replicating some aspects of a second player in Pastiche, if not any competitive aspects just yet. Basically it takes two to expand the palette space to greater possibilities for creating color combinations, and I found a way to do that with a d6 and a simple placement rule for the &quot;AI&quot;. 

Now the only question is how to make the game feel meaningful scoring-wise. Going until the palette tiles ran out meant 72 points in a game that usually stops at 35. So hmmmm. Probably the solution is to cut the tiles in some amount and then attempt to score as well as possible. Score 35 points with 1/3rd the palette tiles perhaps. 

I really do like Pastiche, though. Pleasantly brain-burny but in a very light kind of way. </body>

	<body>Anyways, through talking with non-judgemental friends, faith (shaky at times) in Amaterasu-omikami and Her help, and my little plush elephant Melly

(who is the inspiration for the Elemeeple, and somehow I can put words into her mouth (trunk?) that are kind to me when I cannot say them to myself. It&#039;s only through Melly that I can convince myself to eat some days, and boy, were those some days) 

I do feel better and feel like the days are not closed to me, though I am not all the way better. 

Anyways anyways, I thought I might need to readjust some parameters on my Grand Austria Hotel AI in the realm of having it claim three political cards on rounds 5, 6, and 7 rather than round 4 (too early) and 5, and only at the end of those rounds. And I will do that. 

I also scored, for the first time, over 100 points in that game. 158 points, to be exact. As it turns out, only going for high-VP guests doesn&#039;t yield enough special powers to create awesome combos that let you do a lot more than you could otherwise do. I scored a lot off of the two political cards I was able to achieve (even if it was after the AI took the highest spot on them) and a ton off of the closed rooms on my hotel board. 

There&#039;s a LOT to think about in this game, to the point where the pursuit of points is really gratifying. 

Tomorrow I need to get some sold games mailed out (well, today, actually) in the pursuit of Net Zero, which is really out of whack now, since I got my hands on TIME OF SOCCER. 

I thought about the life of a reviewer, and how if I truly pursue this I will only rarely play games that I&#039;m not going to be reviewing. And to be honest I am fine with this. I always liked exploring new games, so I might as well put that to use, plus the reviewing is helping me really pare down my collection (or at least letting me into the fact that I have a great collection of solo games, and am apparently rather flexible in my tastes). 

And I&#039;ve got a backlog of older games to review from a solo perspective. ^_^</body>

	<body>[ooc]Well, I played 2 games of this, and was a bit let down. I was all prepared to come on here and wonder why it was so easy. I didn&#039;t get it. I played an easy game and won 29-2.  So I played a normal game and won 21-0.  

Well...

I found a big error in my gameplay that I did not catch even with my 3rd read-through of the rules.

I misinterpreted &quot;After the solo player passes, the Centipede reveals one Centipede card and the Worker Phase ends.&quot; to mean that&#039;s the [i]only[/i] time those cards are drawn. LOL. Man no wonder it was easy.  I saw read rules forums for the game to find out I was playing wrong. I should have noticed that that rule was under &quot;Additional Rules&quot;, not &quot;Replaced&quot;.  I completely forgot each turn consists of one action. Gah!

Now I&#039;m scared for a real game of this.[/ooc]

Notes/Comments:
2/17: Game #1 Tactics: [o]I concentrated on exploring hexes around the Great Tunnel to try to keep points flowing for the Slumber bonus. Any hexes I drew for when the Centipedes got &quot;Advance Centipede Sentry&quot;, I always put those where they weren&#039;t inner hexes. It pretty much worked, but I also got real lucky this game...[/o] Quite a few times I drew a Colony (blue) card to make battles happen, when there were either no Centipedes on hexes, or there was just 1, but not on a hex with my ants. I also happened to win 2 battles with one ant by discarding a 4 value card and the Centipede only got a total of 3 across two cards. Yay for Lone Survivor.  

Game #2: Just to make sure it was luck, I played another game. I lost near the start of the 2nd round where I was wiped out. I made some bad decisions early on, was trying something different.

Game #3: Went back to the tactics from the first game, and man it was a close one with some real lucky battles. I won this one 18 to 15. Very close game.

	<body>Ow! Playing four sides on this feels like I&#039;ve been reading the entirety of the Schizophrenica Brittanica (may not be an actual thing... yet); those multiplayer COIN games are having me yearn for a full AI. The solo variant only pitches you against a single opponent - with dice rolls helping govern strategies and placements of units.

I&#039;m one turn into this, and a lot has happened - and been set up for later. 

[imageid=2892808large]

Pier Van Dyken (black) is amassing M-tokens (magic currency to forge and develop units) and The Thorn structure stands ready to hoover up magic wells from conquered lands. He needs four to win the game.

Ulrike Freihoff (red) has an Enlightened One unit on the board. She&#039;s built the first of her six towers, in the north-west, as she&#039;s dominating region 6. 

Passionaria Callo (green) decided to stockpile M-tokens, as she&#039;s trying to avoid lowering her reputation too much by building units - more on that in a moment. 

Olaf Fjollsfinn (blue) has been busiest of all. He managed to put a level one unit - Volcano People - into play, and an Ice Drakkar (the longship at the top of the map). He&#039;s currently of the lowest reputation, which is why Vuko targeted him and slaughtered his level one unit. That still left the Drakkar free to recruit one of Van Dyken&#039;s influence markers and send them to the Ice Garden in the top left corner of the map. He needs to do this six times to win the game. 

So... I&#039;m still getting my head around the black player&#039;s win condition, although the rules have been pretty kind. The green player, I think, looks to be very powerful - but I think it&#039;ll be tough to get her units together to push for her win condition. She needs to dominate an area, have a Nightmare (level 3 unit) seed two terror markers in a region. Then, the Faun (level 2 unit) comes in and closes the land. Everyone is driven out. She needs to do this twice to win. 

Summoning anything drives up the Dead Snow marker. In a four player game it taps out at 30. If you&#039;re thwarted in your personal win condition, you can push for this to close the game. Summoning anything, or even just manipulating the Magic resource on your board, also lowers your reputation. This is key to good play, I think. You can select an action to improve your rep, for a price, but if you don&#039;t do something about this, then Vuko&#039;s the Terminator and you&#039;re Sarah Connor (the weedy one that gets stomped - I&#039;m sure that revisionist movie will be along soon). 

Vuko - really the only noble presence in the game - is an absolute bastard. The person with the worst rep gets a visit, and he kills your unit. In this first round, Olaf put out a level 1 unit just to save the Drakkar and advance his agenda. When Vuko&#039;s killed your unit, he then takes one of your influence cubes hostage, so you can lose dominance in that area and not score resources. Now that is slapping the bad guys down. 

There&#039;s a lot of interlinking mechanisms here, along with a slightly idiosyncratic jostling for both turn order and action selection/completion. Along with that, any influence cubes used in the 0 action space (top right) stay there until the end of the game. You use it to get extra resources or trade something... and whoever has most cubes there at the end of the game - assuming it ends on the 50 point score-track - gets another five bonus points. 

So, yeah... Not a filler game then. </body>

	<body>We watched [i]The Martian[/i] last night. I had read the book earlier this fall and loved it. Loved the movie too. A faithful and still enjoyable rendering of the book. 

So, as when I read the book, I [i]had[/i] to play this! Though it was late, so I merely got it set up and then fell asleep planning my mission. Therefore, it&#039;s currently &quot;on the table.&quot; 

Here&#039;s my mission draw on Very Hard:
[u]Hard missions:[/u]
Extraterrestrial Life 40
Venus Sample Return 24
Man on Mars 24
Lunar Station 15

[u]Medium missions:[/u]
Ceres Lander 8
Phobos Sample Return 12
Lunar Sample Return 10
Space Station 6
[u]
Easy mission:[/u]
Lunar Survey 4

So, anyone else who wants to join in is welcome! I&#039;d love to hear how others solve this. I think I&#039;m going to the moon and hoping that I can do a few probes and that&#039;s it. 
[b]
Edit 2/19/16:[/b]

I&#039;ve been turning this over in my head for the last few days (one of my favorite things about this game!) and decided that I would probably go for Phobos too as the designer suggested below. 
One of the most important decisions you make is &quot;what will my heavy lift system be?&quot; I decided on Saturn due to the massive lift from earth and therefore the ability to get missions going more quickly than if I lifted small bits over and over again.

So, while I was getting dressed this morning I played 3 turns! I did make it to work on time. Never fear. ;)
First I bought survey technology then Saturn technology then 2 probes. 
Next turn I bought a Saturn rocket and Rendezvous technology.
Next turn I launched the Saturn (success! -$10) and then tried to survey solar radiation (minor failure -$5) I surveyed it again and &quot;no solar radiation&quot;!!! Now I have a decision to make. Do I pursue the manned Mars mission? Can I grab it all? Without having to worry about radiation sickness and dealing with the Aldrin Capsule (i.e. I can just take a capsule that will do my landing and carry less weight to get out there). 
I have ideas about getting to Phobos and Ceres in any case, but it&#039;s trying to get to and off of Venus in a timely fashion that is a big issue. Hopefully Phobos yields me something cool and I can buy more, but that Extraterrestrial Life demand [i]eclipses[/i] the other points. Hopefully it&#039;s one of these places and not just on Venus. That&#039;s one of the tougher planets to get to and off of. 

Maybe I&#039;ll get in a few more turns while I brush my teeth tonight! I usually have my turns planned out and can just run through them and it&#039;s a matter of adapting to successes and failures, though sometimes that stops me in my tracks! 

[b]Edit 2/20/16:[/b]

OK, so playing in a disrupted fashion is not advised. I have to start over, I messed up by not drawing the Outcome cards and then when I went back one of them was a Major Failure. Also, I wasn&#039;t as organized as I&#039;d like, so I&#039;m starting over. I will re-shuffle the Moon surface outcomes and the Solar Radiation.
:shake:

[b]Edit (later that day):[/b]

I won! I scored 45-38. It doesn&#039;t look impressive because I didn&#039;t get the Man on Mars or the Lunar sample return (it&#039;s orbiting the moon at least-that&#039;s [i]almost[/i] home!). However, I did manage to survey Mars and Venus and there was no life thereby canceling the big Extraterrestrial life mission and the Venus sample return mission.

I was trying to get too cute in my play above and should have resorted to my usual tactic (which Ivan reminded me of) Buy a tech, buy a Saturn. I think they&#039;re you&#039;re best bets for heavy lifting.

	<body>I stumbled by accident on this game around last Christmas. 

It was on sale with a Dutch translation. Apparently the small Dutch speaking market was not interesting enough to print more than the basic set and Hoth expansions...

---&gt; WHAT a magnificent card game this is though. With all that crazy Star Wars stuff these days, I really fell in love with this Living Card Game.

And for those wanting a SOLO play: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94291/jkssimplified-solo-variant-star-wars-lcg

Thank you JK ...

Someone created a great solo experience for playing against the Dark Side. +1200 downloads means lots of players played it too.

I always wonder how many great things we still miss despite our crazy buying of new stuff.

Art is superb in this SW game btw.

[imageid=2893037large]

The above was a very easy win, but I lost actually more then I&#039;d like against the AI rules.</body>

	<body>Got a play of this in over the weekend against my AI program.  I did end up winning but until the last turn it was VERY close.  I played at a low depth (500) so the game would move briskly so I imagine higher I may have lost!  The final scores looks worse than the gameplay was due to the AIs making random (bad) moves when no move wins any games whatsoever (which in this case I had the win wrapped up in the last turn).  I need to work on that so it least appears as though they are still trying.  :)

** Player 2 had $69
** Player 4 had $24
** Player 3 had $22
** Player 1 had $125 </body>

	<body>I had setup [thing=119506][/thing] a few nights ago and was ready to give it a go, when [user=ap49][/user] showed up to our weekly game night with this for me to borrow. I knew he was going to lend it to me but I didn&#039;t think so soon!

I managed to wake up early this morn so jumped at the chance to play this. Tore down Freedom and went through the tutorial with 4 characters. I chose 4 because 
a) I always choose 4 except in precious few games that don&#039;t need it, like Freedom, Robbie Crusoe, and Gears of War
b) I hear the game is more difficult with 2.

I managed to set them up in a non cumbersome way and went to work on the baddies in the cobwebby location. Took them out pretty well. 

Even though the tutorial doesn&#039;t have any levelling up and omits a ton of other aspects, I enjoyed this greatly. It was a great intro to the game and the action selection reminded me of Space Hulk Death Angel or even shades of the Battlelore: Command IOS app. I really like the ability to engage baddies and your team helping each other out by doing so. 

I hope I can start the campaign tonight. The only downside is they say the Delve standalone scenario is more difficult than the campaign, but I&#039;d love to level up in one playthrough just to see what happens rather than do it slowly through a campaign. But whatevs. 

I am greatly pleased that I never felt like the game was &quot;Choose action, roll dice, rinse repeat&quot;. I got the sense of tying my actions together wisely and attempting to minimize my overall wound acquisition. 

I look forward to really exploring this game a lot more. If it holds up with replayability, it&#039;ll kill Elder Sign for me (an article for another time and in no way implies that this game is an Elder Sign killer in general)

	<body>[b]OKB Returns Rare Minerals from Ceres; Not a Lock to Conduct Arithmetic Properly, However[/b]

I spent a lot of time on this one over the past week, and am moving along the learning curve pretty well, I think. I had a really frustrating go when a program focused on using ion thrusters to get to Phobos and Venus and back was stymied when Venus was found unsafe for landing. I was able to bring back a Phobos sample, but my only chance for a win was to launch an emergency Moon mission in 1976. The problem was, I didn&#039;t have enough time and money to test the last type of (single) rocket needed on the mission fully. I tested my one spare, and had a success that I kept on the achievement; I figured this left me with about a 78% chance of success for when I needed to fire the rocket (one success, plus two unknowns with an expected success of 67% each). Wouldn&#039;t you know it - when I fired the rocket, I drew the one damn failure in the bunch, blowing up my spacecraft and leaving me a few points off of the target for victory.

Still, if it is about process rather than results, the approach for the program was satisfying. I followed that one up with a bit more of a brute force approach to return a sample from Ceres, along with a few survey/lander missions. Timing the purchases and research was the biggest challenge (as it commonly is, I suppose), but it all went pretty smoothly up to the Ceres launch. I was lucky enough to uncover rare minerals on Ceres, which gave me a $50M bonus upon return. I plowed that into the optional capstone of the program, a manned moon mission, which now didn&#039;t need to be developed quite so seat-of-the-pants style. This time, Polkovnik Gagarin sailed all the way to lunar orbit before observing that the Moon, like Venus in the last go-around, was too dangerous to land on. He made it back safely, and stripping the moon mission off of the board lowered the target score and left me with a comfortable victory. 

One last campaign resulted in a hideously ugly success, when I made a notation error that I failed to catch (over and over again). That led to a miscalculation of the resources needed to get to Mercury and back (ugh!); all I could do at that point was salvage what I could in Mercury orbit, and get a lander to Mercury safely for just enough points to squeak over the line (the Venus lander and Mars survey went off without a hitch). At least the good outcome under weak process offsets the Venus/Moon disappointment that started the weekend.

I am probably WAY too into this game, considering that I am basically spending my free time doing math homework and amateur accounting and budgeting. But I get a lot of satisfaction from picking up tricks along the way.</body>

	<body>I keep beating zombies these days!
Finally on my fifth play I believe I managed to get all rules right (doors, buildings, etc)

I also finally played the map properly since last time I did NOT see some buildings. Yeah. 

The tutorial made much more sense this time around for sure, with zombies following the heroes while they try to scape through the buildings and chambers. Nice.

	<body>[Apologies in advance for the wall of text]

Having had enough of struggling with the core set&#039;s basic decks 1-handed, I chose my next step was to try them 2-handed against the same scenario, [b]Passage through Mirkwood[/b].  I played all six combinations at least 3 times.

And what a contrast.  The scenario suddenly became very easy.  Of the 20 games I played, I was only challenged once. 

[b][COLOR=#FF0000]Tactics[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#0033FF]Spirit[/COLOR][/b]
Since I didn&#039;t get much of a go with the Tactics deck 1-handed, I wanted to start with that, and paired it up with the Spirit deck, since it had the strong questing that was missing.  The first game was slow going due to me learning the differences in the gameplay.  

The tactics deck dealt with all the enemies, whilst questing was left mostly to the other side (with [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Thalin[/COLOR][/b] joining in to get in the free damage).  In the first game, this left [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Dunhere[/COLOR][/b] free to have the [b][COLOR=#660000]Hummerhorns[/COLOR][/b] for breakfast.

I made a mistake in the second game by making the Spirit deck first player in the first round, drew a couple of high threat enemies which sent a [b][COLOR=#660000]Forest Spider[/COLOR][/b] the wrong way in the Encounter phase.  It also meant I couldn&#039;t take advantage of the Travel response of [b][COLOR=#996633]Old Forest Road[/COLOR][/b] to ready [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Gimli[/COLOR][/b] for combat.  So choosing first player correctly is a thing.

The third game was the most fun. The penny dropped that I didn&#039;t have to play the cards from one hand only on that side.  I put the attachment [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Unexpected Courage[/COLOR][/b] on [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Gimli[/COLOR][/b] and had him both questing and smiting enemies.  Something funny happened as a result, I declined using [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Eleanor[/COLOR][/b]&#039;s ability to cancel the treachery card effects in order to get damage points on to him, and by the last round he was one very angry dwarf.

My best score was 108 points in both my first and third games (5 and 4 rounds respectively).  I played a couple more to try to crack 100, but failed.

[b][COLOR=#FF0000]Tactics[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#009900]Lore[/COLOR][/b]
Swapping out the Spirit deck for the Lore deck, I was expecting much of the same, i.e. the Tactice deck fighting and the Lore side questing.  This was similar, but because the Lore deck has a higher starting threat level, the enemies are as regularly on that side of the table.  Having the Lore side of the table being engaged by enemies was not a problem as [b][COLOR=#009900]Denethor[/COLOR][/b] would defend and [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Legolas[/COLOR][/b] would use his ranged ability to attack.  Or I would employ the Sentinel ability of the [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Gondorian Spearman[/COLOR][/b] to hop across and defend.  I can&#039;t ever remember needing to use [b][COLOR=#009900]Glorfindel[/COLOR][/b] in combat and he was able to quest every round.

And as such the games went very quickly, too quickly in fact.  I played three times and twice finished in four rounds (lowest score of 106 - still not under 100).  I think in both those games I got [b][COLOR=#009900]Protector of Lorien[/COLOR][/b] out on round 1 and threw lots of cards at it, anything with too high a resource cost or something which seemed a card for a longer game.  As the object is to explore all the cards in the deck, this is not an ideal situation, and I am tempted to try something more challenging. 

But I will continue for now with my original plan and try the other combinations.

[b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Leadership[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#0033FF]Spirit[/COLOR][/b]
The change from the enemy removing power of the Tactics deck was noticeable, although the Leadership deck is still decent at this.

This mix also seemed to have the best collection of useful attachments.  Firstly [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Steward of Gondor[/COLOR][/b] is an obvious accelerator and helped me get my lowest score so far when drawn on round 1.  I can&#039;t imagine this card ever not being chosen in a Leadership deck.  [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Unexpected Courage[/COLOR][/b] is also strong by getting two uses per turn out of one of your heroes (and a pity that there is only one in the core set).

The two willpower boosters made an interesting comparison.  [b][COLOR=#0033FF]The Favor of the Lady[/COLOR][/b] cost 2 for a +1 and nothing else, and I would always prefer to get out a [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Wandering Took[/COLOR][/b] instead as it had greater flexibility for the same cost.  [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Celebrian&#039;s Stone[/COLOR][/b] also cost 2 but gave +2, and also has a benefit that would make this an obvious consideration when designing a mixed Leadership/Spirit deck.

The second game provided an interesting (to me) challenge, as it was the first time that I kept drawing only locations during the Quest phase.  Fortunately, I had a [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Northern Tracker[/COLOR][/b] out who cleaned things up for me very quickly, but I can see how this could easily become an inescapable trap.

My best score was 100 in game 3.  These were the first games that I tried to do little things to try to minimise my score, including questing with an otherwise unneeded 0 willpower ally in my last round, in order to be cannon fodder to any revealed ill effects.  This goes against my natural inclination to maximise preservation.

[b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Leadership[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#009900]Lore[/COLOR][/b]
There is something about the core set Lore deck that I find a bit boring.  Maybe it is because this scenario is so easy that I am just not finding a use for most of the cards.  The healing power is just not needed here.

There is also lots of card drawing which allows you to draw more cards with card drawing.  If you draw [b][COLOR=#009900]Protector of Lorien[/COLOR][/b] then you can use them for something useful.  I do understand the benefits of card drawing to get to the stuff you need, but I guess this deck doesn&#039;t have much of that.  I do like [b][COLOR=#009900]Henamarth Riversong[/COLOR][/b] because if his cost of 1 (I did not draw him in the 1-handed games), and this is another card I would want 3 of if I was constructing.

I did draw [b][COLOR=#666666]Gandalf[/COLOR][/b] more than I had previously, and had fun using [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Ever Vigilant[/COLOR][/b] on him so that he could both quest and attack.  I didn&#039;t get to use [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Sneak Attack[/COLOR][/b] with him, but can see how this would work, or indeed with any card that has &#039;enters play&#039; effects.

I have been scoring each game, but am beginning to think it is not that important.

[b][COLOR=#009900]Lore[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#0033FF]Spirit[/COLOR][/b]
I was unsure how this combination would go.  There are lots of tricks available on the Spirit deck and some capacity to deal with enemies cleverly in the Lore deck, but I was still concerned that it wouldn&#039;t be able to remove enemies quick enough.  It is funny that I just previously mentioned scores because in the first 2 games here I got my lowest score (85, in 3 rounds) and then my second highest (138).  And what a contrast between the two games.

In the first I managed to quest enough to complete one quest per round (drawing [b][COLOR=#993333]Beorn&#039;s Path[/COLOR][/b] for the last one).  Everything just fell perfectly, and it seemed a breeze.  But the second game was a far more enjoyable game to play.

I drew 2 enemies in the Encounter phase of the first round ([b][COLOR=#660000]King Spider[/COLOR][/b] and a second [b][COLOR=#660000]Forest Spider[/COLOR][/b]), and all three engaged.  I had two [b][COLOR=#009900]Forest Snare[/COLOR][/b] in my opening hand, but it would take a couple of turns to get them out.  I did at least manage to bounce one back to the staging area using [b][COLOR=#0033FF]A Light in the Dark[/COLOR][/b] (which also gave [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Dunhere[/COLOR][/b] something better to do), and managed to hold off the other two.  On subsequent rounds I kept drawing at least one enemy, and hence had to save most of my heroes for defence/attack.

Over a few rounds I managed to deploy both Snares and things seemed to settle down.  I had drawn [b][COLOR=#660000]Chieftan Ufthak[/COLOR][/b], who was sitting uninterested in the staging area (immune to Dunhere), but his time was soon approaching.  By use of two [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Lorien Guide[/COLOR][/b], I kept the few locations that I was drawing ticking over, and quested just enough with [b][COLOR=#0033FF]Eowyn[/COLOR][/b] to make slow progress.

But then all hell broke loose.  Whilst I was at [b][COLOR=#993333]A Fork in the Road[/COLOR][/b], I drew the dreaded [b][COLOR=#660000]Ungoliant&#039;s Spawn[/COLOR][/b].  As a result, my quest total dropped below the required target, and my threat levels rose enough to awaken Ufthak.  I sent the Spawn the Lore side, and had to choose to send Ufthak to the Spirit side, who at least had some sacrifice blockers.  I did just enough to quest through to the third stage and thankfully drew [b][COLOR=#993333]Don&#039;t Leave the Path[/COLOR][/b], which at least meant I could concentrate my efforts on the Spawn.  I made a few dents and then [b][COLOR=#666666]Gandalf[/COLOR][/b] turned up just in time as I had run out of sacrifice allies on the Spirit side and threat levels were about to skyrocket.  I finished with half of my heroes surviving with 1 hit left.  Dud score but great fun.

At one stage during this game I had a shortage of cards (due to drawing [b][COLOR=#996633]Enchanted Stream[/COLOR][/b]) and found myself with only [b][COLOR=#009900]Dark Knowledge[/COLOR][/b] in hand, so decided to play it and see what it did.  As expected it was useless.

The third game was a slow and steady affair.  This is an interesting mix of spheres that seems to have the most tricks up the sleeve, and is capable enough.

[b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Leadership[/COLOR]/[COLOR=#FF0000]Tactics[/COLOR][/b]
I left this combination to last on purpose, as it was the one I was least looking forward to.  As usual I played it 3 times and they were all somewhat similar.

As expected, I was able to deal with the enemies relatively easily.  But the questing was slower than usual, except in the first game where I drew [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Celebrian&#039;s Stone[/COLOR][/b].  In the other two I found that [b][COLOR=#CC33CC]Faramir[/COLOR][/b] was especially useful.  The longer games meant that I was able to get some of the higher cost characters into play, including [b][COLOR=#FF0000]Beorn[/COLOR][/b] for the first time.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
My first impressions of this game had me thinking I was going to try to build the best 1-handed deck I could and then play through the scenarios in sequence, swapping in new cards as I came across them.  But it is apparent that this was naïve.

Playing 1-handed is quite difficult, and it also means that you miss out on some of the interactions of playing 2-handed, for example Ranged and Sentinel, and the support the two different decks bring each other.  I found that 2-handed was a richer game, not all that more difficult than 1-handed in terms of game mechanics, and overall more enjoyable.

I still intend to move forward by playing a constructed 1-handed deck next (after all, I have to learn to build one deck before I can build two).  For my first effort, I will play it safe and go with a Leadership/Spirit combination, as this seems to have the most ways to deal with the split resource problem.

	<body>Been awhile since I&#039;ve gotten any solo games to the table... been busy at work and at home.  I really haven&#039;t had time to lurk on this month&#039;s list -- day job is busy and I&#039;m picking up some side work as well. But I have gotten some non-solo games in. My daughter has been  beating  me in [thing=148228][/thing] quite handily.

Today I took said daughter to her violin lesson and it&#039;s just by a coffee shop where we wait. I usually do a little work while there, but today I wasn&#039;t in the mood. I put [thing=182047][/thing] in my bag... quick and easy. And I got a couple of plays in.

1st play -- Employment took a hit early, which meant that I didn&#039;t get much in taxes in the first round. Couldn&#039;t recover.... but I held on to Year 3 before Employment bottomed out.

2nd play -- Nothing really got dinged too much and I got five in taxes after Year 1. I paid off some debt and kept going. After Year 3 I saw I had enough to get rid of the debt, taking the chance that my Employment would bottom out. I took the risk and I won! 

Perfect game for my situation at the coffee shop!

	<body>I decided to play this last night as a nod to the current geek of the week [user=Callasmar][/user] and his contributions towards bringing me indirectly into solo gaming through his Lonesome Gamer series.  

I setup just the base board and drew 3 investigators and got to work.  There were a lot of tense die rolls, one investigator went insane, another was lost in time and space, but was devoured because of the ancient one.   In the end though, the investigators took some major risks sneaking by some monsters but sealed enough gates to win the game.  

I wish I had captured more of the game, but I was so immersed in the gameplay that I lost track of time, and that to me is a sign of a good game.  It&#039;s been on/off the trade pile for some time, and now it&#039;s off again.</body>

	<body>Arboretum with Ricky Royal&#039;s [thread=1521685]solo variant[/thread] has just fired Citadels from my collection. 

I like building my Arboretum and having adjacency and paths matter. It sure beats colored buildings with no effects, or even purple buildings with effects that seem to misfire in a single player game (not a surprise). 

I like the give and take I have with the dummy player Q, which matters quite a bit more than what happens with the roles in FOE or other Citadels solo variants. 

Citadels and Arboretum are, of course, very different games. But for whatever reason, my brain slots them together. 

So yeah. Bye, Citadels. </body>

	<body>Boy...I don&#039;t know what it is about playing this game solo, but it kills my brain. Absolutely wrecks it.  I must read into controlling the bots too much, because my turns (this time as FDR) went pretty smoothly.  When it came to the bot turns, however, I went into severe AP in trying to keep in line with the scripting.  I just end up playing all three hands personally, and miss out on use of special abilities, as well as favor my original country with the decisions make.  I just don&#039;t think this is one I&#039;ll be able to solo.

Going to set up a game of Mage Knight to let my brain cool off.</body>

	<body>Had some extra time tonight and decided to take this out for another play. I played the basic game again and won again. Two plays total and two wins so I figured it was time to add in an expansion! The book of steps has gotten great reviews from many members so I thought that was a logical first step. 

The decisions multiplied using the expansion. How best to use the spells versus a phrophecy. Needing to get the right order of doors instead of being able to just go with the flow. The tension mounted throughout the mid game as the deck thinned out. Every decision to discard became harder knowing what doors still needed to be found. Towards the end it became clear, I was not escaping from this dream. I found five doors before the deck ran out.

:thumbsup: clearly the base game is like an appetizer to the main course. Sure it tastes good but the entree is usually better.

:thumbsup: adds decisions while not overly inflating the playtime.

:thumbsup: if this expansion added this much fun I can&#039;t wait to add the others.

:thumbsdown: a little unclear about the timing of some things that I have to look up more depth.</body>

	<body>This entry is [b]SPOILER FREE[/b]

Believe the hype when it comes to this game. I think my rating for regular Pandemic is an 8 and after my first play of PL, I thought - okay, it&#039;s good, but #1? I just finished March (3 wins in 4 tries with the loss coming in the first game) so I&#039;m doing well. After four plays, I can see why this game is rated so highly. My rating currently sits at a 9 and I could see that going higher. It&#039;s a gaming experience like none other that I&#039;ve ever had. The dynamic and ever-changing situation in this game draws you in along with the cool stuff that you get to unlock.

I&#039;m playing solo so there is no alpha-player problem to worry about, which is one of the knocks against co-ops like Pandemic. It is easy to manage three or four different characters and you still have to figure out how they can best work together to accomplish their objectives before it&#039;s too late. I feel like I&#039;m playing through the movie Outbreak. It is just really cool.  </body>

	<body>Apropos of my fascination with micro-games, I&#039;ve been maintaining a geeklist called [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/183079/cards-games-small-card-counts-under-30]Card games with small card counts (under 30)[/url]. In doing some poking around for this list I stumbled across a whole world of games limited to exactly 18 cards, including this ongoing [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/197621/18-card-microgame-contest-geeklist-2015]competition[/url] and an  [url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/1015024325229788/]18 Cards[/url] Facebook page. Checking out the contest finalists (18 of course) I noted that several are designed for solo play so I printed some out for a try.

First up was [b]Explore the Galaxy[/b], a fun little 10-minute game that features these very nice, colorful cards: 

[imageID=2698064medium]

Each card has three functions:
1) the backs are planets to explore, each with four exploratory requirements;
2) the fronts serve both as explorers, each with three exploratory skills, and 
3) additional, hidden planetary requirements and the planet&#039;s &quot;hedron,&quot; one-fourth of a powerful interplanetary device in need of re-assembly (or so the backstory goes . . .)

To win you must successfully explore a number of planets and in doing so discover at least one of each of the four hedrons (color-coded blue, green, red, and yellow) over the course of four rounds. Not easy. At least not initially: my first two games were bad losses (only two hedrons collected in each). Coming back to it after some thought and a night&#039;s rest my third try was much better, very nearly a win. Then in the fourth game everything went right and I won easily in only three rounds.

There is definitely some luck involved: if you reach the last round and it takes too long to find the remaining color of hedron you need (or it isn&#039;t there at all) you&#039;re cooked, but that actually chimes well with the exploration/discovery theme. I think there might be one best strategy, and once you figure it out (took me three games) you&#039;ll probably come out a winner more often than not. The rules do suggest that you can ramp up the difficulty by disallowing cooperation between the red and blue explorer factions. Haven&#039;t tried it yet but yeah, that would definitely make success harder to come by.

	<body>So this was waiting for me today after work, alongside Shadowrun Crossfire which apparently was delivered yesterday but the delivery company forgot to leave a note that it was at my neighbour&#039;s... :shake:

So I bought this through an bidding on eBay, although the guy says it was in pristine condition, the box had a couple of mashed corners (nothing mayor) and it came with one of the minis broken from the base... But the rest I have to say looks new.

So overlooking this I prepared my first game after going through the rulebook. Looked quite promising and it didn&#039;t disappoint at all. The game system is just awesome, I wish more games used it. To be fair is also my first dungeon crawler, so I don&#039;t know if more games have something similar :laugh: 

The game was a blast, easy to learn and quite challenging (lost after closing the hole in the ground). Looking forward to more games of this.

I already ordered the first mission pack trough printerstudio, anything more that I should get for this? :p

	<body>I think I&#039;ve found a nice quick solo optimization game.  So far I&#039;ve played it 3 times last night and found it to be quite engaging.  Here&#039;s a few pictures I snapped before getting into my 4th game:

[ImageID=2894534medium]
[ImageID=2894536medium]

Essentially what you&#039;re doing is playing a card and determining if you&#039;ll deliver goods to that space station spot, or have that ship fly away.  If another ship is docked there already you end up moving in a clockwise motion to the next available space, and when that happens you&#039;re transporting more goods.  The same is true in reverse - if you play a card and no ship is there to leave you go to the next available one, and the number of spaces in between is the number of goods you can load to your ship.  Each of the spaces also contains another action, one to covert resources, one to hire another pilot/ship, and one to sell a red rock for 2 money.  When you run out of cards to play, you end part &quot;A&quot; of the game.

For Part &quot;B&quot; the spaceships are flying away from the foundry towards another station and use those rocks to produce goods, which you want to load back onto your ship.  The actual board flips over and there are a few other actions that you take instead of the original ones (e.g. you can&#039;t hire pilots, but you need to &quot;upgrade&quot; the ship (which has to be empty) or you get -2 points per ship, instead of trading 1 red rock for 2 money you can &quot;activate&quot; the goods you&#039;ve produced which grants you an extra point for each one that is loaded back to your ship.  If your ship has an empty space then you&#039;re also docked -2 points (this happens per ship that has an empty spot).

The scoring is between 22-24 points, and like Loyang I think it&#039;s going to be a struggle to get there.  I&#039;ve only been able to secure scores of 18 points so far, but the game has me itching to play it again and again.  

The replayability seems quite high due to the fact that there are multiple types of goods that are randomly selected per game.  The metal coins that were part of the KS are excellent, the card stock is a little thin but serviceable - I sleeved mine.

I&#039;d recommend checking it out if you like optimization puzzles.

	<body>I had my third solo session with this behemoth of a game - with the &amp;Cetera expansion it totals over 2000 tokens!

Thankfully there&#039;s a whole list of scenarios (or puzzles as they are called) for solo players. There is a beat your score aspect to them, with records. Not that I am anywhere near those records, I am happy to be able to make one stock for the twenty rounds a solo play lasts.

[imageid=2894611 large]
[i]This is the &quot;Sea for one&quot; puzzle where you have plenty of space to build factories, but the mountains are across the sea so you need ... roads and boats! I added an oil rig to feel at home (Norwegian, living in Sweden).[/i]

This game is really special - it&#039;s pick up and deliver to its most extreme, and very addictive. I can&#039;t wait to try this with more players, there are some very interesting levels of interaction in this game, it can go from nice to nasty very fast. But for now I enjoy some solo sessions with this classic, yet new acquaintance of mine :-)</body>

	<body> Got this from my BGG Secret Santa and I&#039;m finally getting it out on the table.

I played my first game two days ago. I played the recommended game for first timers and long story short; it was a blast.

I didn&#039;t, however, win. I made it easily (luckily) to the 3rd objective but there is where the Perfect Organism struck their fatal blow. 

Playing solo, I ignored the one card that stated I couldn&#039;t fight the enemy unless I had cooperative support. I guess I could have played more than one avatar. More than one avatar would have given me a better chance and fighting/healing in the end. 

My one gripe is the initial unboxing. I love a good unboxing with the sorting and punching out cardboard, but the cards were in random order and it took watching a YouTube tutorial to figure out how I was going to separate and organize my cards. That took waaay longer and much more of an effort than the actual game.

Still, I loved the game and can&#039;t way to play more!

	<body>My winnings from the generosity thread arrived today - all the way from my wife&#039;s home town of Koln, Germany. I&#039;ve had an eye out for this for a while, and it all looks great - a thinky high seas adventure game (shades of RPG to it). I&#039;m interested to see how it compares to another favourite of mine, Merchants and Marauders. 

This is the second game I&#039;ve won this way, the first being Battle for Souls. I still adore that one, so I&#039;m hoping some of that love finds fair winds here.

I&#039;m really surprised no one else wanted to enter the draw for it. But thanks. :)

	<body>This small pick-up-and-deliver game has quickly become one of my favourite games in the [family=78][/family]. While marketed as a game for two, there is a [url=http://www.erlkoenig.ws/hrrg/website/home/receiver.php?do=ShowInfo&amp;main=hanse&amp;sub=rule&amp;page=2&amp;lang=1]solo variant provided by the designer[/url] - which is how I&#039;ve played 8 of my 10 games so far. I&#039;ve only beaten the AI once in 8 games. My most recent one I lost 53:70, so it&#039;s still quite challenging for me. 

Your aim, whether you play against a human opponent or the AI, is to earn 70 Megagalax before your opponent does. You do so by transporting goods of different value from one planet to a different one where these goods are in demand.
The human player can acquire technologies and use them to his/her advantage, transport passengers for extra income, and react flexibly to changing demand and supply. The AI, on the other hand, always gets the most profitable cargo available. It doesn&#039;t spend energy units on flight - once per turn, it automatically reaches the destination planet for its current cargo, while the human player might need a second turn for long-distance travel. So you really have to use those cards (technologies and passengers) well, otherwise you won&#039;t stand a chance against the AI.

Playing against the AI is naturally a lot more predictable than playing against a human opponent: you know that it will always go for the most profitable cargo. It can&#039;t hit you with any unexpected cargo exchange.  It can&#039;t block the cards you are trying to play. And you won&#039;t suddenly find yourself on the other end of the galaxy from where you wanted to be. But since you don&#039;t know what&#039;s on the other side of the cargo cards that the AI is currently transporting, you can&#039;t know for sure where it will go next turn, so it isn&#039;t *too* predictable.

This is what the game looks set up for solo play:
[ImageID=2894697 medium]
Note that the glass counters didn&#039;t come with the game. I&#039;m using them to track which actions I&#039;ve already used, because you get one flight action, two planet actions and two interventions each turn, and some of the interventions buy you another flight or planet action. I tend to get confused about what I&#039;ve done already without something to track my actions.

[b]My likes and dislikes[/b]

:thumbsup: The science fiction theme. Pretty planet tokens. Charming old-fashioned card art.
:thumbsup: The goods transportation mechanics: once you&#039;ve delivered your cargo, the cards are flipped over and new goods are added to that location.
:thumbsup: Small box. Plays quickly.
:thumbsdown: The spaces on the sun-shaped score board are a bit too small/too close together so you have to be very careful not to mess up their status. Would have been nice to have numbered spaces (I think someone has uploaded a modified version in the files section which does that).
:thumbsdown: Bad rolls and bad card draws can really mess you up, though it felt like less of a problem in the solo variant than in the two-player game.

Overall, though, I enjoy this game quite a bit. It doesn&#039;t happen often that I play the same game 7 times in two days, even if it is a short one.</body>

	<body>Played four games of this thanks to a generous loan by [user=fortheloveofdice][/user]

Lost the first game when I was arrested by the police in the very last round of the game for having an unburied body.

Second game I scored a magnificent 170 points! Scoring the second highest rating of Evil Innkeeper.

[imageid=2894733 large]

Any concern I had about the game being too easy was fixed by the third game, I was arrested in the last round of the first season.

The final game I scored 100 points, not high enough to get a rating.

[imageid=2894735 large]

Very interesting use of cards with multiple uses. You get two actions a round, and at the end of the round the guests leave and new ones arrive. If you have unburied bodies at the end of the round and there are any police in the inn you lose the game in solo mode (in multiplayer you lose bribe money instead). You can bribe guests to join your hand or kill them. Once a guest is in your hand they can be added into a tableau as an &quot;annex&quot; with special abilities and space to bury bodies. Guests in your hand can be spent to bribe/kill/bury other guests/bodies. Some guests have skills so they can be used to bribe/kill/bury without actually losing them from your hand. You don&#039;t get money from killing guests until you have buried them.

Interesting combination of resource management, tableau building and push-your-luck that plays in 15-20 minutes. 

:star: Gorgeous and macabre art
:star: Unique gothic theme that appeals to the horror lover in me
:star: Very quick to play, 15-20 minutes to set up and play a game
:star: Simple rules but tons of decisions to make
:halfstar: Has some similarities to, but is a bit more complex than, [thing=158900][/thing], which I already own
:nostar: Not sure about longevity, but given that I have played 4 games already today and will probably play a few more after dinner perhaps that isn&#039;t an issue. Curious to see how it plays multiplayer</body>

	<body>Played a quick mission of MERCS: Recon tonight.  Quick because it ended in a pretty spectacular defeat for my Kemvar faction.  I randomly drew the &quot;Get Some Rack Time&quot; mission, which I knew would be challenging.  Kemvar do the least amount of collateral damage of all four factions; two of their MERCS in fact are melee specialists without any guns.  Their corporate ability allows them to reduce potential damage from enemies.

The mission required the MERCs to find the weapon rack in a random location, and during the ensuing Breach &amp; Clear, destroy it.  That means accumulating lots of hits with the Collateral Damage Dice during the B&amp;C fight, and as mentioned, Kemvar is not a good group for this.

I decided to try it anyways.  I am still experimenting with a good color scheme for Kemvar.  I thought putting a splash of greenish-yellow on their backs would look nice, but it doesn&#039;t align with the their camouflage skills.  I&#039;ll likely do some more painting until I get the right feeling.

Here is the setup, with my MERCs entering from the elevator.  The weapons rack in under one of those light green disks.  I&#039;m using colored 1.25 inch colored disks I ordered form Print &amp; Play, both to replace the Agent disks that came with the game and also to place under each MERC&#039;s base so I could more easily tell who is who.

[imageid=2894761 large]

[imageid=2894770 large]

I&#039;m also using the solo player sheets from BGG, which does make it easier to run all five MERCs by yourself.

[imageid=2894781 large] 

The weapons rack ended up being in the last place we checked, in a corner office.  Kemvar have two MERCs that can reveal objectives, one with a scanner and one with a door hammer.  The good news is that we met almost no opposition on our way there, so the Security Level had not budged.

[imageid=2894793 large]

And then it all went south.  I should have spent a turn or two adjusting the priority of my group before busting in the doors but I rushed because I feared a bad OfFor movement card was due.  We got slaughtered in the Breach and Clear, and did not come close to destroying the objective (only 2 of the 10 hits needed).  Lesson learned - choose missions carefully next time.

[imageid=2894768 large]

Still, a fun learning experience.  The play flows pretty smoothly and I am definitely enjoying this system.</body>

	<body>Tonight I tried to play the app for this game - once again - and I think I&#039;m now done with it for good. Despite tinkering with settings, it&#039;s woefully slow, the interface is just clunky, for me. I turned it off, got out the cards and set up the same scenario - and I can actually play the card game faster. (Bearing in mind, the book-keeping has never slowed me down.)

Took three favourites from the base game: Absolute Zero, The Wraith and Fanatic up against Citizen Dawn in the Megalopolis. SNAFU: suffered the usual death by a thousand papercuts from CD, who I have never even come close to beating. Some BS draws and horrendous minion pairings saw my team having little to do. When Fanatic is losing cards from her hand, hand over fist, she really struggles. Zero got stuck in a cycle of just healing himself. The Wraith held her own until a card wiped all bloody equipment and ongoing cards off the table. Never recovered. 

I&#039;ve got a couple of mini-expansions on the way (Chokepoint being one; the other is a location). I noticed, earlier, that villain Wager Master is now here in the UK. Anyone any thoughts on him? I baulked a bit at the price, as postage for the mini-deck was as much as the retail price for it. 

And I think I&#039;m trying to preserve more cash for Too Many Bones. (But they&#039;re hopefully still trying to do something about postage.)</body>

	<body>After my extreme positive reaction to the tutorial, I busted it out last night to try the first quest in the campaign. I lost by the second Location (out of 4) and lost hard. The rules say that whether you win or lose, move on to the second quest. 

&quot;NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAY!&quot; I bellowed into the night, clenched fist punching the heavens in a thunderous sonic boom. &quot;I shall not venture so unprepared into the cold embrace of Quest the Second!&quot;

What really allowed me to give myself the mulligan was seeing how the quests evolve over time and how I wasted wayyyy too much time attacking  enemies and healing. I just need to bust through those locations like a party of bosses.

I really like this design. Attempt two at the 1st quest was awesome! While I lost, I was soooo close to a win. 

It feels weird that the game end effect difference (in quest 1, at least) between defeat and victory is so minor. My adventurers are &quot;defeated&quot; but they all still level up and everything by quest end. I get how and why it&#039;s done, but it does feel weird that any form of permadeath doesn&#039;t really happen. 

However, I do see the replayability even in the same campaign. I do think it&#039;s such an amazing system and I hope they support the heck out o fit, evolving the system as need be. </body>

	<body>Was wrecking house (or so I thought), so I figured I&#039;d buy up two more piles to get the total piles to 5 exhausted and end this thing, so I could add up victory points.  

But MAN it was close...I just so happened to oppose duke Hrothgar the Conqueror, who gets +2 vp per monster (left in stack) and +1 vp per titan (special monster).  I had duke Elysium the Allsmith, who gets a (very) small bonus for just about everything.  I added mine first, and had a whopping 91, figuring I crushed it, being 8 points higher than last game.  

Well, what I thought would be a knockout, like the last game (83-29), ended up being a near loss, at 91-89!  What a game...I had no idea.  This was a great game to verify that in fact you can lose solo in this, or at least come close enough to show that you could lose.  I was worried that every game, while maybe not as easy as the first, would still be a blowout.  This one put that suspicion to rest!  

Looking forward to more...</body>

	<body>Okay, so this does not quite count as a full solo play-through. It has been probably over a year since I last pulled Khronos out to refresh myself on the rules and go through the game. I will likely never get this played with anyone--it&#039;s one of the first games I ever bought when the board game bug bit me, and I&#039;m afraid I wasn&#039;t so great at rule teaching yet, so my poor wife and her brother both suffered through a game with me. She has actually offered to play it one extra time not long ago, but the timing was poor since I would have had to re-read the rules and get it into my bloodstream again.

Anyways, I spent a few nights before bed reviewing the rulebook, got the game out and set up on a weekend. It&#039;s winter, so space is a little more limited (no porch), and I commandeered one end of the dinner table for the game. I got the game going on a Friday night (four player), but got busy on Saturday. My wife in the meantime got busy on the middle of the table with her sewing machine and her own project. I realized by that evening that it was futile to attempt to play, between the stuff I had going, keeping the cat off of the game, and my wife, who I caught doing this:

[imageid=2895000medium]

She saw me take the picture over her shoulder and said &quot;oh, I guess I should probably move this...&quot;
I packed up the game pretty quick, figuring I was courting disaster for this board at this particular time.

After writing this I want to get it out again and finish!
To be fair, I also realized that I had immediately played a placement rule incorrectly, and felt I just had too much going on to keep everything straight in my mind.

	<body>I have the week off of work due to a minor injury (nothing serious, just need to rest up) so I figured I would take advantage of the time and get this awesome game to the table.

I did okay with remembering rules, but strategy not so much. Defeated the red city, but my last ditch attempt at taking on the blue city during the last night did not go well. Between taking some risks earlier in the game and jumping into the blue city seriously unprepared, this was the pile of wounds I had to deduct from my score at the end:

Glorfindel, Bilbo, and Legolas needed to heal a hurt eagle.
It was quite bloody hell.

[IMG]http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/radagast-the-brown-john-f-willis.jpg[/IMG]

Radagast showed up to help,

[IMG]http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--DpUy-DOf--/17mu84m626ernjpg.jpg[/IMG]

 and then instantly died from spider poison, before he did a bloody thing.

[IMG]http://2013.globalgamejam.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/screenshots/2013/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-27%20at%202.57.53%20PM.png?itok=8LyNtRuI[/IMG]

So the eagle continued to deplete in health.
[IMG]http://www.freerangekids.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/elf-1.jpg[/IMG]

An elf joined to help.

[IMG]http://www.elfontheshelf.com/sites/default/files/homepage/family-tradition-update/familytradition-elves.png[/IMG]

Then another

more elves kept showing up...

[IMG]http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/446779/file-2250248967-png/blog/elf-on-a-shelf.png[/IMG]

So many damn elves, yet the bird was still dying!
Glorfindel was spending all his energy to tend the bird, but it got weaker and weaker.

One elf allowed the team to peek at the Encounter Deck&#039;s top card. This became the most important element to keep the team on even key.

Then double Radagasts appeared. (Is this even legal?) :p


Finally the eagle was stable, and the elves found enough...

[IMG]https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/5c/95/a3/5c95a38f91b7283577c6c9c5aad24786.jpg[/IMG]

...herbs they could finally save the eagle.

I think the final threat was 46. Gandalf had to come in once or twice, just to keep it tamed.


This single-handed LotR is pretty rough. I like someone&#039;s variant idea that Ranged characters can Attack before the enemy, so they get some use in a single-handed game. I might try that next time.

	<body>Well, in honor of our beloved host of this month, I tried Trove again this evening. I had fun playing with the knight the first couple of games. Today, it was time to try something new. I settled on the Dragon. Seemed interesting and powerful.

The dragon feels distinctly different than the Knight does. He is a big lumbering beast and he moves slow but gets more powerful as you go. The catch is that as the dragon gets more powerful, the game speeds up. It is a neat mechanic and it works quite well in this game.

My dragon did a pretty good job of exploring the cave and waking up. Once he did though, he couldn&#039;t get out of the cave in time and the cave collapsed.

I like this game. I can&#039;t say that I love this game, but that might just be the weight of the game. The solitaire version of the two character types I have played so far feel light. There is strategy and good decisions, but they aren&#039;t meaty and agonizing. But there is definitely a place for a game like this on my shelf. There isn&#039;t always time for a deep meaty game, and this game plays very fast solitaire. I do get the sense that multiplayer would work out much differently, as you don&#039;t want to make moves that allow other players to get to far ahead. And that gets tricky when most of your moves will affect other players.

:thumbsup: Not just one game, but 4 distinct solitaire games.
:thumbsup: Challenge feels right. Feels like you will win or lose the game on the last turn each game. (Which is really cool considering each character has different mechanics and the tension feels the same).
:thumbsup: Plays light and fast.
:thumbsdown: Rulebook is hard to navigate. (so far ... this will change, I am sure.)
:thumbsdown: :thumbsup: Solitaire game is fairly light.</body>

New party, new game, old problem. Running out of time because of bad die rolls. What am I doing wrong? My characters help each other out. Check. I discard to explore again and again. Check. But sometimes I get stuck in a barrier with one character for far too long it seems. Or I simply can&#039;t close a spot. Is it all really just depending on die rolls? I don&#039;t want to believe that.

Edit:
Played a 2 heroes game with Qualzar and Harsk and I have finally beaten my first game. Only to fail at the next one... lovely! I keep playing with 2 heroes. Plays kinda smoother I think.</body>

Part of my thematic challenges list.

Broke out to play the official solo rules and had a pleasant game.

The first part of the game is where everything really happens. You rack your brain trying to figure out the most efficient combo based on the cards in the Journal of Encounters. McKenzie is skip to the looing up the river and the pressure builds. It is a medium brain puzzle and then...then your combos come together and you put it in overdrive and start flying through. Hoping that it isn&#039;t too late and hoping you calculated correctly to get through the mountains quickly.

I really enjoy this game. I lean towards the variant that plays more like a multiplayer game as it is truly more difficult than the official rules but I enjoy both. I am considering taking a mountain piece or two and rolling a  d20 and placing an obstacle there to see what issues that brings up. I rarely have time to build boats though as the solo game happens so much faster than a true multiplayer version where you can feed off of the other players and gauge how fast you need to move while the other players are building their engines.

:thumbsup: Absolutely beautiful game to look at
:thumbsup: The bio about the cards is a very thoughtful and neat addition
:thumbsdown: I forget to move McKenzie each turn as I&#039;m so engrossed so I&#039;ve had to adapt a variant but it works for me</body>

	<body>Got this in finally. Personally I play by drawing one Captain Card at the start of a career and that is my skippers special ability for the game. I do not try to play against the captain and see if I can do better than he. This does not break the game and adds that nice RPG/unique feel to each skipper.

:thumbsup: Much improved over The Hunters in terms of components and replay ability.
:thumbsup: Captain Cards with special abilities add to the connection of the game. Nice large ship counters. 
:thumbsdown: Can get stuck in a depth charge cycle that will most likely end your career. However, that is accurate and life.

Her amazing game photos are an inspiration. 

Been in the Lake District this week in a house with friends (6 adults and 5 kids) and had a decent view from our bedroom.

Decided to play Onirim this morning and took this picture.

[imageid=2895518 medium]
However, I didn&#039;t get to finish the game.

My wife came into the room and said &quot;How does playing that help us get out the door?&quot;

I responded brilliantly with &quot;Ummmmm.... errrrrrr.... uhhhhhhhh......&quot; :shake:

Anyway, had a great week in one of our favourite places even if playing games and posting on BGG has taken a back seat.</body>

	<body>Needed to play something that would cheer me up. So what better way to do that than to rob three safes and escape in a helicopter. Very uplifting!

I played with one character, using The Hawk. She infiltrated a building that, for once, was built after common sense. There was a stairwell from first floor directly to the top floor. Never had this in a game, all three stair tiles were on the exact same spot on each floor.
But she must&#039;ve been too clumsy, because she was caught while trying to crack the second safe. 

[imageid=2895532large]

I used the &quot;lost visual&quot; cards and that even saved her at one point, because just as the guard was about to catch up with her, he lost interest and decided to investigate something else.

After being caught, I played it again with one character. This time, I used The Raven. I managed to crack two safes. But the second one had a persian kitty in it. And we all know that kitties are drawn to laser points and laser grids. She had lots of fun triggering alarms... Again, another bust.

:thumbsup: Awesome game, just fun to play. And I love the box!
:thumbsdown: More tiles would be great so you don&#039;t use all the tiles in every game, for more randomness.
:thumbsdown: Tile laying, fun game. If you&#039;re not into that, you might have slightly less fun playing it.

	<body>I took on the game that davekuhns shared a page or so back, and may have succeeded. I am not yet sure – this write-up is a first effort at double-checking my math and maneuvers, and people more familiar with Leaving Earth may observe some basic errors that I could have made in my own favor.

In any case, I thought I would share my plan of attack and adventure. The set of missions was beefy, to say the least. The target score was 72 (I think), meaning that it was necessary to choose at least one of: extraterrestrial life (40 points), man on Mars (24 points), and Venus sample (24 points). I opted for the Venus sample, and after crunching the numbers for the Mars mission versus the other missions, decided to go for the full set of remaining missions. This meant that I needed to complete: Phobos sample (12 points), Ceres lander (8 points), and most of four related missions – lunar station (15 points), lunar sample (10 points), lunar survey (4 points), and space station (6 points).

I could make all of the non-lunar missions and still hit the lunar missions under a streamlined plan, knowing that there may be some unmitigated risk at some point. The rough plan:

[o]Limit propulsion in non-lunar missions to ion thrusters (3 for Venus, 1 each for Phobos and Ceres) and Soyuz rockets

Launch to Venus and Phobos early to allow more time to utilize fewer ion thrusters

Begin with Saturn launches that include carrying cheap cargo that will be useful in later missions (e.g., Junos for lunar missions) and that can be used in early rendezvous tests

Apply small end-of-year balances to the purchase of Junos, to be used to fill cargo capacity and to test landing

Test ion thrusters from Earth orbit by attempting one-year maneuvers with excessive payloads (the maneuver fails and the craft remains in Earth orbit, I think); send damaged thrusters to Earth for repair

Launch one two-stage Saturn cargo mission (20 payload capacity when firing one Saturn on Earth followed by one Saturn in suborbital flight) to carry up to two Soyuz rockets (one required for the Venus mission and one optional for the lunar missions) and any remaining required ion thrusters and other items for the Venus and Phobos launches

Complete landing (and, jointly, Juno) tests while the Venus and Phobos vehicles are en route

Add any required components to the Ceres vehicle (other components already in Earth orbit) and launch with enough time to use two-year maneuvers with an ion thruster when necessary

Launch capsules (if not already in orbit) and test life support

Test Atlas rockets for lunar missions, if feasible (or necessary, versus using surplus Junos)

Recruit a lucky participant for the weirdest camping trip ever, and purchase all remaining needed components

Launch the lunar vehicle[/o]

This is already getting long, so I will wrap it up: 

[o]The Venus and Phobos missions were launched in 1967, scheduled to reach Venus in 1973 and Phobos in 1971 (using the optional time token alternative). Both sites were safe for landing (with water on Venus), and samples were collected and sent back to Earth (using a Soyuz to get off of Venus, and a long maneuver to get off of Phobos). 

The Ceres craft launched in 1970, using a two-year maneuver to get to the inner planets transfer, and another two-year maneuver to get to Ceres.[/o]

From 1971 onwards, all activity was focused on developing life support and Atlas rockets, and obtaining all required components for the lunar missions. 

Life support was developed by 1973 (assuming I did the end-of-year outcome draws and research activity properly), but I didn’t have enough time and money left to test Atlases properly. This meant either finding a way to use orbiting Junos (of which there were many), rolling the dice on the Atlases, or a mix of the two (I opted for the mix, but could have made it work with just Junos if my head had been a bit clearer).

Boris Yegorov was sent along with supplies, an Eagle, Atlases and Junos on a two-Saturn launch in 1975. He docked with orbiting components, including the vintage Soyuz, more Junos and a probe, and made it safely to the Moon (the Atlas worked, and it was safe for landing) after leaving Junos for the return trip in lunar orbit. He collected a sample (which led to a valuable mineral bonus), sent it home on the probe, and survived through the end of the year.

This gave me enough points to exceed the target (75, if counting correctly), and the lunar sample bonus gave me enough cash to put together an emergency mission to feed Boris for at least another year (dropping supplies from lunar orbit). During the emergency mission, the probe surveyed the Moon (which was skipped in the frantic final days of preparing the lunar missions). I don’t know if I am eligible for the surveying points since the Moon was no longer unexplored; then again, Boris did the exploration, which is a hands-on survey. If the supply drop kept Boris alive, I finished with an unofficial 79 (with the survey) or 75 (without) points. If the supply drop was illegal and Boris starved to death while still on the clock, I finished with 77 or 73. Either way, that was much better than expected; I got plenty of breaks, though – if any targets were out of play, I would have been completely out of luck. Likewise, if the Atlas had misfired, neither of the higher-point lunar missions would have been satisfied.

I’ll run this one again to see if I can clean it up a bit, and to see how lucky I was the first time around. Like Dave, I look forward to seeing how others attack this one. And thanks again to Dave – I would not have considered such an ambitious package of missions without your post!

If anyone noticed any illegal moves, please let me know. I am still working through the mechanics of the game, and could easily be misinterpreting key parts of the rulebook.

	<body>Another play of this quick to set up (and sometimes quick to lose) deck-builder, earlier today. I&#039;m still not sure that I&#039;m playing entirely correctly. I get that the Pathfinder donates two recruitment points to two different cards, but is that only when he&#039;s put in the support rank? I assume the (three?) recruitment costs signified by the parachute symbol on his card means that if I keep him n hand I can play him for the three points of his own value in the recruitment round?

Similarly, any cards I have left in hand at the end of a round can be used to make a purchase to the value of their own rewritten cost, right? But what about officers who have that option, but also have the chance to organise cards or offer two recruitment points if she&#039;d as support? (Actually, I assume they&#039;ve only got a recruitment value of one, if she&#039;d straight from your hand at the end.)

...

Incidentally, lost again. Four static defences snuck out of the gloom and boxed me in. (Three in one round - awful draw). And I need to see a card which lets you permanently drop a Disorganised card out of your deck. I assume there is one in the recruitment deck?

	<body>Continuing my campaign, tried the second quest. Boy, does that ever get tough with its continuing peril effects. It seemed that my party kept getting sickened, and how thematic as they were chasing the source of the poison from Quest 1!

Another loss but at least I defeated the baddie from Quest 1. I am really, really enjoying this. Like, a ridiculous amount. Even though I have borrowed it from a friend, this will be an insta-buy when it&#039;s back on shelves.

I set up quest 3. Here&#039;s a spectacular pic of it.

This was cool! As a learning game I decided to go the easy route with five missions pulled from the Easy deck. Even then, it was quite a bit of thinking to try and plan everything out. As you can see from the available missions, I needed at least 9 points to claim a victory and decided to focus on surveys since that seemed to make the most sense. Since everything would be sent to Earth Orbit first, I could hit Mars and the Moon with the exact same build.

[imageid=2895901large]
I decided to build Atlas and Soyuz rockets to launch probes past the Moon and Mars, so to start out I simply attempted to launch a multistage rocket into orbit. Wile the Soyuz worked great, there was an issue with the Atlas causing it to be damaged. The next year, after having the rocket repaired, I started prepping survey probes and tried a two-stage launch into orbit--off the backs of two Atlas rockets--to survey the Solar Radiation, but the whole shebang exploded on the launch pad (stupid Atlases). However, doing the same the year after that was finally successful, not only letting me work out the kinks in my rockets, but also some hiccoughs with my survey tech. I had a working survey probe in orbit.

After that it was only a matter time, really. Sitting there for a while and working through the math, I figured that a survey probe under power of two Soyuz and one Atlas would be enough to get to the moon or Mars, and there wasn&#039;t much point in doing any other research. 
[i][size=8]Work with me: 23 mass x 3 difficulty needs 69 thrust into Suborbit. Then 14 mass x 5 difficulty is another 70 to get into orbit, hence Soyuz and Soyuz. After that I had 27 thrust to move just 5 mass, which got me wherever I needed to go from there.[/size][/i]
Luckily, the Soyuz rockets proved much more reliable and I had no difficulties doing a fly-by of the Moon and Mars, resulting in a clear victory by 1964. In case you&#039;re wondering, the Moon was a wasteland while Mars had signs of life. 8)

It was a cool feeling, especially when push came to shove and I buckled down to figure out the exact flow I would need for my missions. It was also crazy that it took me nearly half the game for an Easy setting with basically the same two missions. I saw a ton of ways to be more efficient later (like launching the Mars probe [i]first[/i], for example), but in the moment it&#039;s hard to tell. Plus if there had been issues with my Soyuz rockets it would have delayed me further. All in all I&#039;m [u]really[/u] looking forward to ratcheting up the difficulty.</body>

It was a rather overcast day, and really kind of dreary.  So, I thought it would be a perfect day for some Mage Knight.  Well, really?  When is it not a perfect day for Mage Knight!?!  

I played Solo Conquest with Goldyx.  It was my second time with solo conquest and I am really happy about it.  It was a blast, and I only had to check the rules a few times for something minor.  I seemed like I was always moving forward and I never felt stuck.  

I also conquered my very first city!!! Here&#039;s Goldyx doing the Heisman on it!

[center][ImageID=2895935 medium][/center]
This was a pretty awesome moment for me.  I flipped over the enemy tokens of the first city and realized I could beat all three of them during that turn. I would have had to take seven wounds, so I decided to only defeat two and come back for the last one.  I took two wounds, and was able to heal them right away.  Then, in the next turn I went back in and got the last enemy.  It was great!  

[b]Edit: 2.19.16[/b] Solo Conquest with Krang today. I scored 177 points!!! Here is Krang standing over his vanquished enemies!

	<body>Finally getting this one to the table but, man, I need some &quot;admin&quot; advice from grizzled veterans. The set-up time is currently double that of Arkham Horror (with everything mixed in). I&#039;m curious how people are storing it all to minimise wasted game time. 

I have this base set, ready to go, with the tiles and extras from Caverns of Cynder in it - and the second base set box, but I haven&#039;t started putting that together yet. This box is packed with stuff, but I&#039;d like to know how folk are storing tiles, at least, as I&#039;m concerned about them chafing around in the box. 

Still... Twenty more pages of rules to go before I can embark on the tutorial adventure. And I thought it took long enough to assemble the minis.

It&#039;s a 2-player card game where the players try to move cards to the opposite corner of the 5x5 square to score them. I am playing using the solitaire rules so I needed to move each color of cards to its opposite corner then total up the points for the cards that reached scoring areas. 

I&#039;m not certain how many points I need to score to get a good score, but I&#039;ve been scoring between 10 and 18 points so far.

Edit:  I played several more games, and my highest score was 28.

These were my 4,5 and 6th games of Viticulture overall and I quite like it. However, sometimes the card draws feel a bit too random. Almost as if it&#039;s possible for them to make or break a win. Anyone else get this feeling? A certain Visitor at the right moment can really propel you where a turn or two later they are kinda meh and just linger in your hand or even worse you slug away trying to get a red vine and just keep drawing whites or vice versa. So far I have only felt this to a large extent once in a 4-player game and once in a game with the Automa. Thoughts?</body>

	<body>After giving some advice in the forum for this game, I was inspired to break it out for a couple of games tonight. As usual I played on hard difficulty (starting with 2 cards in hand instead of 4).

Game one started out very rocky. I spent most of the game 7 or 8 points behind the centipedes. I did manage to evolve my ant completely for 3 extra VPs. Ended the final round 2 points behind before we hit the queen phase. 

[imageid=2896232 large]

There were 5 centipedes in the Great Hall, meaning I had a lot of work to catch up. With one evolution that allowed me to move a few ants at the beginning of the queen phase, and another that allowed me to double harvest one collection site (which I used for a VP collection site) I managed to tie the centipedes at 22 points.

[imageid=2896233 large]

The second game went much better. With an early card that brought me a bunch of larvae, I managed to clear out a bunch of centipedes. Camping in the highest numbered hex, I took out a lot of centipedes attempting to enter the meadow. With this steady supply of food I drew a lot of cards that helped out further with combat.

[imageid=2896235 large]

Final score 20 to 14, a very satisfying victory.

[imageid=2896236 large]

I love this game, each time I play the path to victory is quite different. The first game my evolutions were key to keeping up with the centipedes, allowing me to manipulate my position after the soldier phase. In the second game I barely evolved at all, instead using my cards and my favourable position to take out centipedes as they entered the meadow. Highly recommended. There is also an expansion coming soon to KS that the designers have promised will contain a bunch of content for solo players. Can&#039;t wait!</body>

At first, the intent was only to do a &quot;brief&quot; (sic) sheet with rules references to find the paragraphs easily while playing... 
Then I was tempted to put some arrows between the different actions, then ... more arrows appeared, round and round and round... the more I played (with the game and illustrator), the more it looked like a flowchart... I never did such an exercise before. 

I know, some of you are fairly familiar with organigram (especially programmers, I guess), but I&#039;m not. I woke up several mornings, in a row, with a new idea to implement, in order to solve the arrow problems I had been facing the previous day. The things we may experiment to play our games are just... amazing. And I found the exercise very intense and intriguing. I would invite anyone, feeling like it naturally, to try the exercise, at least once. That&#039;s a very peculiar way to revisit a rulebook. 

I uploaded the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/128650/silent-victory-flowchart]resulting file[/url], in the game section, yesterday, hoping to receive some feedback (as long as anyone, but me, could understand anything to it :)) specially regarding the accuracy.

Greg, the game&#039;s designer, commented :
[q=&quot;Sturmer&quot;]Delphine,

This borders on scary  :)   I have yet to check it...not sure I am capable!  LOL.

Very nice!

Greg[/q]
Sure, it does look absolutely crazy :D. 
[i]Do not take this post as a shameless self-promotion ;). It&#039;s genuinely a report of my gaming activity for the past few days and the new horizons it opened to me. I don&#039;t even suggest to try to seriously decipher my exercise. I&#039;m sure, I would built it differently today, but my free time will be limited soon, and I don&#039;t intent to rebuild it from scratch. Not for the moment, anyway.[/i]

Meanwhile, Captain Koinsky won a decisive victory and some minor awards (not even a Navy Cross). The USS Dorado - a GATO class submarine - became the pride of the U.S. Navy. She did 10 patrols, from April 1942 to the end of the war. She cruised and dived in Philippines, Indochina, Solomon, Java, China, Empire seas. I find that extremely exotic[i] (The Hunters oceans were more familiar to me)[/i]
She sunk 21 ships and rescued 3 aviators. She has been a very good ship, indeed.

Side note : there is a website where you can read the authentic patrol reports of many US Submarines that fought during WWII.

I haven&#039;t read the one of the USS Dorado, but I read the USS Pampanito&#039;s report that I visited in San Fransisco harbor. [b]Fascinating![/b]

	<body>This is the third of five plays with each of the Nations on their B-sides to take advantage of the special abilities. The recent Dynasty expansion has not been integrated into the game because I am comparing plays with each B-side player board to my original ten plays with the generic A-side.  Following are SGOYT posts of the previous games:

Greece is solid in multiplayer and was great to play solo.  An early conquer of Hispania (not really helped by the Hoplites) was the beginning of a consistent food supply for the entire game.  The star feature of the Greece tableau is the Golden Age ability to provide resources and victory points. It is an awesome ability and should always be fully exploited.  

Greece was fun to play but there were some real star performing cards not on the template.  In the following picture you will see Sun Tzu who I reinserted behind the active advisor during scoring.  I did this because under the solo rules Tzu is a great advisor and he was an MVP until Marie Curie came in toward the end of the Industrial Age and inspired a polar expedition.  The first two Wonders I complete: Petra and Royal Society may not provide much scoring but they feature awesome abilities and helped set up some great turns.

The AI event tile is placed on the board to show, that combined with the extra workers, the outrageous food shortage experienced on the final turn.  However early booms and the ability to maintain a rainy day fund left Greece in great shape with an excellent score.  As I like to do, the coins on book at the upper right Wonder development box representing the final book score.

	<body>Had another late night play of this game and struggled early on just to hang onto guys and not get total disorganization. By mid-game I had managed to gain some pretty good ground and could cope better with the German deck.  With some judicious use (and loss) of guys later in the game I managed to pull off a Silver Star Victory.  The hardest thing for me is to realize I have to sacrifice a few men in order to keep disorganization from overtaking the whole game.  Just hate losing guys but it is in the nature of the game you must do it.

:thumbsup: Games are quick, no down time at all
:thumbsup: Each game creates a story (if one has any sort of imagination)
:thumbsup: A decent amount of tension is there while you play the game. My interest is held throughout
:thumbsdown: Due to unlucky card draws, games can be almost hopeless from the start</body>

	<body>I set this up two nights ago, incorporating the Lost Legion expansion.  So, really, the first night was spent figuring out what cards and chits need to be replaced and triple-checking that I kept all the right ones.  

Choosing randomly, I ended up with Norowas as my primary Knight and Arythea as the dummy.  I played the first day and night round, but didn&#039;t do too hot.  My first few turns were focused on defeating the ancient ruins for a quick level jump, but after that it was essentially me trying my best to recruit some units.  The combination of the terrain, and how the cards came off my deck, made movement and combat a nightmare.  My progression was seriously stymied because my options were so limited.  

Making my way farther inland, the first core tile I encounter was the titular Lost Legion.  I was nowhere near ready to take them on, so I dawdled for a few turns, pillaging villages and razing a monastery, trying to build a large enough hand that I could effectively deal with them.  It wasn&#039;t until the last night that I attempted my assault.  Volkare&#039;s level was only set at 5, but with a lot of the tokens having multiple attacks or arcane immunity, I found myself struggling to do much against them.  I also triggered the dragon rampaging enemy, which definitely didn&#039;t help my case.

Ultimately, after dust settled and points were added up, I ended up with mediocre 71 points.  Norowas was never really my best character (Tovak is my personal favorite), and with how the board revealed itself I felt that my options were fairly limited.  It&#039;s also been a while since I played last, so failing to remember strategies/deck composition played into it, no doubt.  In any case, I had a lot of fun and am looking forward to taking on Volkare another day.

	<body>Stupid me finally arrived. :D

Harsk and Melindra are a kick-ass team and so far I&#039;ve beaten the 3 scenarios in the core game plus 2 scenarios of the burnt offerings adventure path with them.

It&#039;s a lot of fun to re-built your deck with all the stuff you find along the way. This is exactly what I was hoping to get with the game.

[ImageID=2896812 large]

Still I hope I played that re-building part correct.

Aaaaand I still think this game plays way better with 2 characters than with 4.</body>

	<body>Put out this one for the first time. Cahokia fell in the middle of Mississippi era (second era of three).

During the Hopewell (first) era I focused on having the peace pipes as far away from hometown as possible and totally forgot that they will be removed in the end of the era when there will be no mounded chiefdom on that warpath. I was kind of surprised then, when three of five went away. I also pretty much messed up rules for revolts and practically ignored them in Hopewell. And finally, forgot to use two dice instead of one when I could.

It was nearly sure that I will not see the Spaniards coming and soon the Black Tortoise Ho-Chunks reached the breached palisades of Cahokia, leaving just leftovers for Shawnees.

	<body>I just played my first game of this zombie-smashing goodness. It was the tutorial quest, where the survivors have to escape through the portal.

The first part of the game went quite well, I got two crossbows which could be used together for rolling 4 attack dice instead of the meager one die most weapons provide I had in the game.

Then I opened a hatch and found [b]eight[/b] Zombies on the other side in the small room! This poor souls most probably tried to hide there, but finally got transformed through wicked magic to the feral beasts they are now... 

Since this was the only way to the portal, I moved all my chars in and tried to kill of as many as possible so my dwarf tank &quot;Samson&quot; could take most hits and absorb them with his great armor and defense skill. Well, then came Baldric who was very keen on trying his new powerful spell... He had a 50/50 chance of hitting, of course he missed and he hit poor Samson, but he is tough, isnt he? He had to roll a 3, 4, 5 or 6 on a d6 and also had a free reroll if he should have missed! Nothing can go wrong, right? Eh. First roll was a &quot;2&quot; and reroll was a &quot;1&quot;.
And since fouls Baldric spell made 2 damage, and Samson already had one wound from a prior fight, it was just enough to kill him. Since all survivors have to get to the portal the quest was failed, through Baldrics own hands... :shake:

	<body>So last month [listitem=4412501]I found this game[/listitem] at Half Price Books for... well, more than half price but it was in pristine condition. I&#039;m *cough* working from home today and it was a slow afternoon. My wife was working and soooo... something needed to get to the table

I placed it out and read the rules. It seemed a bit overwhelming. I thought I&#039;d have a hard time with it since I&#039;ve never played a wargame before, but alas it took me until the end of Round 2 to get the flow of it. Once I did it went fast. I did have to consult the rules when I drew different iMpi chit but that was it. 

I was thinking &quot;Man this game is slow&quot; but then the Storehouse caught fire and the iButho entered from the Right Horn. And then Night fell... I then realized I was halfway through the game! I tried hard to get Zulus in the compound, but my rolls of 5 dice always missed. Drats. I was routed.

But it was fun! Glad I took the time to figure it out. I really, really want to play it again.</body>

	<body>For my first game outside of the tutorial I decided to start small and chose the Southern campaign. Immediately after unboxing this again I found there were some reference cards for the Winter Quarters and Battles - great! I overlooked these initially and was thinking about just putting this all into a word doc... The second thing I did that I should have done before is I read through the non-player examples in the Playbook.  I found these because I thought there were other scenarios in there (like in Navajo Wars). I wish I would have found those in the tutorial game!

So now before even starting my campaign I learned a bunch, including that I was doing the NP British garrison command wrong - it&#039;s so much worse for the Pats when done correctly! Ouch.

First WQ came and went and advantage Brits for sure. Now realizing a bit of strategy for the Rebels I&#039;m making things a bit better for the next WQ (I hope) - the Rebels just need to hold on.  After WQ Clinton vacated NYC to lead a large group of British Regulars to Charles Town. Seeing my opportunity I took NYC back with a vengeance a couple of turns later - all the while chipping away via Skirmish at Charles Town Brits. Washington&#039;s army that had been amassing in PA doled out some hurt. The French Blockade on NYC also helped keep the Brits away long enough for me to move units through and take back New Jersey and then on to NYC for a win there.  Things are getting hairy though, the Indian presence has grown and needs to be addressed and the Patriots are sorely in need of reinforcements. I have no militia on the map and am nearly stretched thin.

The current board status:
[imageid=2897090 medium]

After I got back to the game board I realized in that picture that Charles Town had no control so I fixed that.  I didn&#039;t see anything about leaders influencing control and they disappear if there are no faction pieces so I believe that was correct.

Pushing on I kept up the pressure on the Brits in Charles Town, NYC and Boston. On the last turn before WQ though I unfortunately was out of resources and more or less ineffectual - but I did manage a skirmish that took out the Brits ability to reward loyalty in a space during the final WQ.  The final score was Patriots with 6 for a succession succeeds result.

:thumbsup: I really enjoy this system, bots are always a bit of a brain cruncher to control but I&#039;m glad to have another game of this depth that I can play solo.
:thumbsup: There&#039;s so much to do, a big part of working out the strategy is making every move count since you go every other turn (more or less). The eligibility and action flow chart is brilliant as you have many factors to consider before you commit to what you plan to do.
:thumbsdown: I have a feeling I might not be getting the bots 100% right for at least another half-dozen games. :D  Working out their turns eats up a majority of the time.
:thumbsdown::thumbsup: I&#039;m really anxious to play out a MP game with someone, however, I don&#039;t feel I have enough of a handle on the nuances yet to teach it quickly enough that it doesn&#039;t become a slog. On the other hand, it looks like that is achievable given more time controlling the bots and understanding how these commands work in detail. I do wish that the playbook offered more examples of play though. 

I&#039;ve packed it up but again I&#039;m already looking for a time slot to fit another game in, I want to tackle the longer campaigns, also try playing just one faction and change to run the Royalist side instead... lots to do.  And my box of VPG goodies arrives today too (Healthy Heart Hospital, Swing States 2012, Sign of the Pagan)... ack!  Too many good choices of un-played or little played games, fortunately I&#039;m done with new purchases until DotZ shows up so I&#039;ll get to rotate through these for awhile. I&#039;m still equally itching to dig back into Silent Victory as well.

	<body>I have tried davekuhns&#039; challenge a few more times since having a lucky break the first time through. I have been close each time, so it does look like these very hard program may be doable without being an expert.

Since it seems people don&#039;t mind detailed program reports, I thought I would show mine for the latest adventure. This one was a thriller, in which Venus was impossible for landing, but I had a narrow window to use my Venus craft to get to Mars and dock with the Phobos lander if it found evidence of life on Mars. It did! As usual, I got sloppy by the end, but I was able to pull out a victory (if and only if I didn&#039;t do anything against the rules, of course).

The full details of the program are in the spoiler box (and will be cross-posted on the Leaving Earth forum, in case some folks aren&#039;t smart enough to check this place out):

	<body>Keeping things straightforward with this game, as I messed up a previously play by forgetting to play the villain cards (hence not posted).

In this game I selected Baron Blade as the villain for tonight&#039;s action, and then picked Legacy, Wraith, and the Tempest as my team. Megalopolis was to be my location.

Things started for the team quite slowly, with my heroes not chucking out much damage, and so taking a few turns to get rid of Blade&#039;s defence platform. Once that had been taken down, it was tit for tat handing out damage for most of the game. With my heroes getting low on hit points and a train crash pending, it was left to Wraith to pull out her barrage and finish off Blade (well, until a future episode).

	<body>I decided to re-try the mission I failed a few days ago with a different faction, to see how much of a difference it would make.

It made a huge difference.

I used CCC this time.  Whereas Kemvar had two melee MERCS, CCC has none.  They are all about dishing out tons of damage, much of it collateral. 

I used the same office setup.  The CCC minis are primed but not yet painted.

[imageid=2897146 large]

[imageid=2897147 large]

We got lucky this time, finding the weapons rack in the first room scanned.  But as Kemvar didn&#039;t really meet any opposition in its game, it wasn&#039;t a huge change.  I do wonder what kind of organization puts a weapons rack in a data center.

[imageid=2897149 large]

As we were about the breach the door, Dr. I. M. Clueless wandered by, started to demand who we were and what we thought we were doing, but quickly decided it would be vastly better to just stand there and cower.

[imageid=2897150 large]

And here&#039;s where CCC showed it is not Kemvar.  After three rounds in B&amp;C, it had half-cleared the room and put the collateral damage track up to 8 of the needed 10 damage.

[imageid=2897155 large]

And then the Gunner&#039;s turn came.  You don&#039;t have to know anything about MERCS: Recon to look at this card and know that rolling 12 dice is something special.  He shredded the room, and a few SecFors, guaranteeing we would achieve the objective.

[imageid=2897152 large]

[imageid=2897154 large]

The Security Level jumped from I to IV just like that (2 levels per mission card, 1 due to placing the first Collateral Damage Disk).  The MERCS then needed to get to the conference room for extraction.  If it had been on the other side of the board, it would have been a challenge but as it was, it was almost next door.

Each of the two core sets has its own set of 10 mission cards, and this one I used is from the set that comes with Kemvar and Kezai Waza.  I am now wondering whether it is best to match the missions with the factions they come with.  Time, and more plays, will tell.

Next up, a random mission from the EU, Inc/CCC core set.</body>

	<body>It&#039;s been a long time since I actually played Mage Knight. Even longer since I had what felt like a good play through. I played solo conquest as Norowas with Goldyx as the dummy. 

Today was one of those happy times when you feel like you&#039;re getting all of the cards that you need. I managed to beat my way through the map, and I&#039;ve finally learned that as I level I need to target the different types of enemy to get a proportional amount of fame as I levelled. 

Found and beat the first city at the start of the third day. Then the second city was Volkaires camp which I managed to beat on the final turn of the third day. He stacks a lot of enemies with him but my selection of units helped me. 

Final score 167. </body>

First play tonight. It was like a breath of fresh air. Simple, elegant, hard decisions, some randomness (thanks Morten) but mitigated by the Grande. Just a beautiful experience. I won/lost my first game. Rule error but already set up to play again after the kids drift off. I can say without a doubt that this will be a favorite. Snowdonia is the only thing I can compare this to in its feel however the choices seem a bit tougher and if the Automata blocks more than one of the actions you wanted then the game takes a tough twist. Looking forward to discovering the buildings and their influence and the summer and winter visitors. All seem to be really strong. Great game and so happy it is finally in my collection. 

Shadowrun crossfire is next. Feel like it will be harder to get a grasp on, hope not but based on my first flip through the rulebook and falling asleep during Ricky&#039;s tutorial, not a comment on box of delights just that I tried to watch after midnight and his soothing delivery and voice knocked me out. Woke up with the iPad wedged in my face. </body>

	<body>Haven&#039;t posted here for several months, partly because of a serious lack of gaming time recently but also partly because I just got out of the rhythm. Have still been gaming at a decent clip and just recently finished up a first play through of this one, which I got as a holiday gift and have been pretty excited about. I really liked [thing=72225][/thing] and this one seemed a little more streamlined and accessible so it might be easier to get to the table as a multiplayer game as well.

[ImageID=2897359 medium]

I really liked it! Once I learned the rules, it played pretty fast, but like other Vital Lacerda games there&#039;s just so much going on - lots of different systems that are all totally interconnected, and there&#039;s no way of knowing how things fit together until you&#039;ve played through the whole game at least once (and most likely it will take me several plays to really grok it). This game seems like a clear case where a few reasonably simple rules really add up to more than the sum of their parts.

I played solo two-handed to learn the rules before trying the solitaire variant. I had my two gallerists try very different strategies - one focused on discovering and promoting artists and buying and selling their art, while the other put a lot of time and energy into the &quot;international market.&quot; It felt like the gallerist that was really focusing on the artists was way ahead for most of the game, but much to my surprise and delight, when it came time to calculate final scores, that one only won a super tight margin of 174-170!

My takeaway is that there are multiple very different possible winning strategies, which is absolutely a must in a game with so many different options - they all need to be viable for the game to keep my interest. So far, so good with this one.</body>

	<body>Logging my 3rd play of this in the last 2 weeks. Liking it more and more. Not too long and not too short. Not too heavy nor too shallow. I can get through a season in about a day, played over 3-4 short sessions. A lot of time I play a few moves while working on the Baseball Highlights 2045 app if I&#039;m doing a process that will take more than a few minutes. 

Notched down the difficulty a little bit. Neutral team strengths are at level 3 but I&#039;m using level 2 for neutral team matchups so the underdog has a slightly greater chance of winning - the setting of the difficulty level in this solo is quite ingenious. You have 2 parameters you can play with. 

I&#039;ve been having trouble getting bonuses for matching up player skills, which is how you get a powerhouse club in this game, so this season we decided to focus on that. 

As usual, I was unable to compete for the first 2 weeks, but then worked my way up to the level where the other teams were. I made a point of purchasing players and coaches with good passing skills and had 2 combos by the mid point of the season, but the team was still languishing in 5th place. The leaders, Yellow, had gone through the first half of the season undefeated. 

Cup play began and I drew the leader at home. We played well but lost 2-0. The board had 2 players on it that would make a big difference and give us a chance to salvage the season. And, miraculously, I had the funds to capture both of them without having to sell a player which is rare this late in the game. The &quot;AI&quot; however sniped both of them from me on the very days that I was about to obtain each of them. Honestly, when this happens, it makes me more furious than just about any other mechanism in any other game. Just like when Football Manager on the PC screws you and you feel like putting a chair through your computer monitor. It&#039;s great stuff when a game can get you so passionate. :) 

I decided to give up on the passing talent strategy because the players I needed just weren&#039;t showing up on the board. I dumped a coach and one of the best passers, drew 0-0 in week 6, and it really looked hopeless at this point. 

Week 7 and a brilliant passer shows up on the board right next to my scout. I just hate this game so much at times! 

Went on to have my worst finish ever, although there was still a decent chance at a 2nd place finish in the league on the last day of the season. We lost 5-3. 

Yellow:  43 points (cup and league champions) 
Purple:  32 points (cup and league runner-up) 
Green:   25 points 
Red:     21 points 
[b]Blue/Me: 20 points [/b]
Black:   19 points </body>

	<body>I played my very first round of SotM over the last two nights. I started last night but tonight I couldn&#039;t remember where I was so I started over.
I played Legacy, Fanatic, and Tempest against Baron Blade in the Ruins of Atlantis.

I&#039;m definitely not sure if I kept exact proper track of HP damage modifiers for everyone, but from what I can glean in the Rules forum I think I came close.

Regardless, I got a proper ass-kicking, which I assume (hoping) is a normal occurrence for this game. I was actually a little upset, which I will take as a good sign since the game got me good and involved in the stakes. :)
I was a little worried going in about all of the kvetching people have regarding the &quot;math&quot; of the game. Eh. Yeah there&#039;s a lot to keep track of, but I also found it didn&#039;t detract at all for me from the immersion of the game story. </body>

	<body>Dang birthday money got me all itchy again to grab some stuff. Found this on the geekmarket for 20 bucks shipped in like new condition. How can I say no?

Got it out tonight. Just played 3 times... and lost due to outbreaks every time within just a handful of turns.

Now I&#039;m certainly prone to rules mistakes, but I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m playing the outbreaks right. I read the rules (which are oddly unclear on a couple things... odd for a game with this pedigree) several times and can&#039;t decide how I&#039;d be doing it wrong if at all. So before I explain it, I&#039;m going to do 2 things:

1. Go check the forums for clarification
2. See if anyone here had this same issue and can help me understand...

[size=24][b]THE CURE.[/b][/size]

[IMG]https://continuumissues.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/colbertmicgif.gif?w=604[/IMG]

[b]Update:[/b] Just played with correct outbreak rules. It&#039;s amazing how rules can become crystal clear in the rulebook once you actually know how they&#039;re supposed to work. Does vanilla pandemic work the same way? Do outbreaks only happen when you have 3 of one color? I&#039;ve always played outbreaks on just 3 cubes. Could be a mind blow moment. I went all the way through legacy that way, too.

Anyway, game was much more interesting, but I think I need a few more runs at it before I decide if it&#039;s fun or not.</body>

	<body>Another game of one of my favourite solo games (also pretty good multiplayer). I am getting excited about the upcoming kickstarter for the expansion.

[imageid=2897454 large]

Another tense game on hard difficulty (2 starting cards instead of 4 for normal). Was a real challenge to keep up with the centipedes who kept popping up and wiping out my ants. I fought very hard and tried to use my resources wisely.

[imageid=2897455 large]

After tallying the final slumber phase, with 4 centipedes in the meadow, we ended up neck and neck with 15 points each.

[imageid=2897456 large]

Only a tie, but it was hard won.

:star: Unique theme
:star: Gorgeous components
:star: Tight gameplay
:star: Excellent solo mode
:star: Plays quickly but good brain burner
:nostar: Expansion can&#039;t get here fast enough!</body>

	<body>After a few brain-burning games of [thing=156496][/thing] I decided to set up something quick and light. Note: the dragon in the middle is a pathfinder mini I used to pimp out the game, along with a few other minis to replace the monster tokens and a yellow cube to replace the sun token.

Played as the dwarf, Krutzbeck.

[imageid=2897459 large]

[imageid=2897460 large]

Fairly uneventful entry to the dungeon until I hit a crossfire trap that caused me 3 HP of damage.

[imageid=2897461 large]

Other than the path being long and convoluted, my journey to the treasure room was fairly uneventful.

[imageid=2897462 large]

With the sun rapidly falling, the race was on to get out of the dungeon before I was trapped forever by the fall of night. First hurdle was a Sorcerer.

[imageid=2897463 large]

With only a five spaces left, and just enough turns to reach the exit, I acquired a potentially deadly Lingering Shade. Unfortunately, two spaces from the exit, and with 1590 gold in pocket, I was finally killed by the Shade.

Mate, this is my favourite &#039;small&#039; game (small in terms of table space required), it made a great intense story and the randomness of the dice are well balanced with the cards.

Really really love it!</body>

	<body>The Netherlands mounted an expedition to climb K2. They had hired a resolute guide to help them make their way to the summit.
It was harsh. Ice, snow, avalanches, chocolate bars... There were many obstacles to be conquered. Said to say that only one person, Maarten made it to the summit, the rest only to the traverse. Apart from Pieter, who decided to stay up there more permanently. Apparently I&#039;m not as good a guide as I thought.

The first time I played it with the advanced rules, giving the climbers abilities. That made the game more interesting. And I only scored 26 points, which meant a minor defeat. Just one point more and I would&#039;ve scored a draw at least.

[imageid=2897585large]

Not sure on how much I like this game yet, time will tell if I keep playing it. Setup is easy enough and the rules aren&#039;t complicated either, even adding the advanced skills. Just make sure to not forget them...

:thumbsup: I like the theme and its a pretty easy game, mechanics and rule wise.

:thumbsdown: Not sure that I will keep playing it. </body>

EDIT: I also meant to mention I almost went with Snow tyres for those tight corners on this track but at the last minute I noticed that the clever driver dashboard wheel thing was only showing 4 gears!  Close one.  Incidentally the roads on the reverse of my B boards don&#039;t quite line up, they are just ever so slightly off - you might notice in the photo above.  That is the only time that has happened with this game which is pretty good considering the amount of combinations that can be achieved.

25+ is a win for this game and 35+ is considered &quot;expert&quot; win. I scored a 23. :(

I&#039;m going to need a strategic breakthrough to do better with this! I tried a little different tack when I saw that I could get 2 of the coin bonuses and possibly a 2 point bonus per bonus tile that I would try that strategy. I got some of the tile draws I wanted, but then didn&#039;t end up being able to get any coins! I still got 2 tiles for an extra 4 points, and one got me 3 points, but it still wasn&#039;t enough.

	<body>After spending all day watching videos of wargames after requesting some guild advice that ended in me buying a whole lot of games that I didn&#039;t expected to buy this month (why did I ask? :p) I was up for putting this on the table after the introduction earlier this week.

I decided to go again for the 1st mission as the other day I was defeated. This time, with Marcus and Augustus, everything went smooth as I knew a bit more about the cards and actions. My defensive skills were definitely more thought out and none off them ended up bleeding (there was two agonising moments though :laugh:). This time everything ended well with a fast victory.

I am really liking this game, tomorrow will go for the 2nd mission :)

So I set up China Shop mission today, I have to say that it was a very interesting mission. Much more challenging with the Berserker running around all the time and longer than the introductory mission, but still not too long. 

[imageid=2899005]

[imageid=2899007]

[imageid=2899009]

[imageid=2899010]

Along the way we had a couple of tough situations, but we managed to pull of and continue. At the end, a couple of bad rolls with the big weapon to damage the Berserker failed (what are the possibilities to get all 4 black dice and 3 red dice blank in one throw?) and ended up overrun. Will try again next time, as I was very close to win this. But definitely the game feels quite tight at every moment.

	<body>Today without messing the rules. During the Hopewell era I focused on mound one chiefdom on every warpath and to push the peace pipes as far as I could. The begining of Mississippian era was like this:

[imageid=2898074]

I thought something like, OK, this looks fine, Ho-Chunks might be problem, but I can handle it.

Well, it was not good idea to have all that mounded chiefdoms in position 1. I spent lot of APs to counterattack the enemies that passed the plain chiefdoms without problem and lost my pipes early. Also with the mounded obsidian chiefdom I should probably turn to buzzard cult.

This was the result:

[imageid=2898081]

Three successfull Caddo attacks with one 1 dice roll followed by Cherokee attack.
At least I saw Coosa card in play. Hoping for Spanish next time.

So, after two sessions, I see it like this:
:thumbsup: one hour game play (or less with practice)
:thumbsup: :thumbsdown: tactics &gt; strategy (I might be wrong here), but both present (that is definitely :thumbsup:)
:thumbsdown: rolling a lot of &quot;1s&quot; will hurt you and you can do nothing against

	<body>Took a break from my Imperial Settlers obsession to revisit this one. I tend to leave this one set up and play a few games over the course of a few days. Last night, I scored 100.5, while this morning, I raised my score to 109.5. I know some of you Arle fanatics regularly break 120 or higher, but I was happy with my scores, especially since it&#039;s been months since my last play. My biggest struggle with the game is picking a strategy and sticking to it. On the other hand, I try not to let myself get too bogged down by so many options, and I just kind of go with the flow.

	<body>I know many of you are familiar with this game. First time played for me. I actually enjoyed it. Usually I love thematic games that feel like you&#039;re participating in a story, whether it be fantasy, saving the world from Great Old Ones or enemy spies, or whatever the case may be. Onirim is not really thematic to me at all. But I found it pretty quick to play and a fun game in a sort of &quot;solitaire/patience&quot; kind of way.

I played the base game and ended one door short with no way to get the last door I needed. Compared to the one play of Sylvion (base game) I think Onirim will get played more, but maybe that would change as I bring in more of the add-ons to both games. I can see why many people are fans of the Oniverse games (and I can see why some people aren&#039;t). I didn&#039;t really expect to like it much. I&#039;ll have to see if it holds up. Might be one of those games I pull out when I want something quick and light, but challenging.</body>

	<body>Got in another game of this today.  Finally made sure to get all the rules right as well. :p

Instead of using one of the missions, I just went with the basic solo game.  I managed to maintain the first player marker anytime the Vikings attacked, which worked well for me 2 out of 3 times.  Ended up losing my Library, but my farm hadn&#039;t started accumulating cows yet, so it wasn&#039;t a horrible loss.

I ended up with a score of 89.  Not as good as my last score, but then again, I didn&#039;t (accidentally) cheat this time, either.

	<body>My first play of Albion&#039;s Legacy was quite interesting. The dice rolls were constantly pressuring me to want to head back to Camelot and heal or repair, but there is never enough time, so I decided to press onwards.  I was fortunate to do so because on the very last action of the last turn of the game I managed to escort the last person to their destination.

So for my first experience it had a lot of tense die rolling, and good exploring elements.  I&#039;m looking forward to my next play.

	<body>It&#039;s been far too long since I&#039;ve played Mistfall, which is a surprise hit for me from last year.  In fact I stated before that I think the card play here is better than Mage Knight (and I happen to really like that game as well).  So after a long hiatus, I settled back into a more difficult mission - The Tangled Path.  

[ImageID=2898491medium]

This mission makes the board shift, and there&#039;s a requirement to complete at least one Wildlands, Deadlands, and Badlands location before taking on the boss (Waychanger).  

[ImageID=2898493medium]

All was going well for me, and unlike some of the other missions I was in control most of the way, saving up my coins to buy cards during the last battle.  I took a short breather before heading into the final battle, which provided to be interesting because I was able to string specific combos together.  With Crow I was able to do a double backstab with Venomtongue and my normal daggers to cause the Waychanger because of an upgrade card which allows 2 regular actions.  The Dawnbreaker cleric was able to help finish him off with 2 fists of Dawnstar, each only providing 1 wound and 1 fire because of the Divine keyword, and the Hammer fell dealing another 6 points of damage plus some fire tokens.  The end was close as the Dawnbreaker just hung on through the damage and was able to see the Waychanger succumb to the holy flame.

Was getting a rule wrong which was really making it hard to win.  When I used equipment I discarded it rather than tapping it.
But now I&#039;ve sorted that out it&#039;s been a blast.

	<body>Decided to muck around with this and invent a scenario to play out.
I&#039;ll start out with the contents of the starter box and then slowly add forces to each side as the battle for this system escalates as the Empire and the Rebellion send more assets to keep the fight going.
Not trying to fight a &#039;balanced&#039; battle (they rarely are let&#039;s face it), but am interested in the story that develops.
Will post more as I get started.

[b]Edit:[/b]

The Rebel ships jumped into the Kinooine system, it may have been a desolate nowhere in the outer rim, but Rebel High Command had been told there was important information on the Empire&#039;s ship building program on the main planet.
The Nebulon-B and CR90 were surprised to find a Victory Class Star Destroying orbiting the planet when they arrived.
&quot;All personal to action stations, launch fighters and shields up.&quot; Orders ran out across the flight deck as pilots scrambled to their X-Wings and the unmistakable sound of engines powering up filled the hangers.
&quot;All wings be advised the Star Destroyer is launching TIEs, prepare to engage.&quot;
&quot;Copy that Flight Control.&quot;
&quot;Comms, get a message to the Rebel Fleet we need reinforcements if they expect us to get the Intel from this rock.&quot;
&quot;Be advised Sir, the Star Destroyer is calling for reinforcements as well!&quot;
&quot;I&#039;ve got a bad feeling about this ... Lets move to attack speed.&quot;

[b]Edit 2:[/b]
The Nebulon-B and CR90 accelerate towards the Star Destroyer, the intention being for the CR90 to get around into the rear of the enemy ship while the Nebulon-B flies around the other side, unfortunetly the CR90 misjudges the angle of its attack and the Star Destroyer fires a foward volley that strips away the CR90&#039;s shields and does severe damage causing it to limp away from the fight.
Meanwhile the Nebulon-B manages to get a shot into the front of the Star Destroyer as it slips past to the side.
&quot;Brace for return fire!&quot;
Suddenly the helm flashed red with alarms as the Damage Control officer got onto the internal comms, &quot;Emergency teams to Alpha 5 -Gamma 3 section, the engine has taken a serious hit.&quot;
&quot;Pull out, get me Rebel HQ we need immediate suport.  Lets see how important HQ thinks this information is.&quot;
&quot;Yes sir, connection coming through now.&quot;

To be continued ...

After saving the eagles, I decided to try the same Lore/Tactics deck on the Passage Through Mirkwood.

[IMG]http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/b/b4/Legolas_with_bow.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120728195423[/IMG]

Legolas slaughtered a ton of spiders.

Bilbo on the otherhand, with a defensive attachment helped defend against the evil beasts.

[IMG]https://bbbseed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/7.19.13-2.jpg[/IMG]

Really wasn&#039;t much of a battle at all. The final threat was 39.

[IMG]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/COLJK93UEAAYXDW.jpg[/IMG]

Glad to see my decks are getting stronger.

Since single-handed LotR has a bit of a disadvantage, I used someone else&#039;s idea of [i]Ranged[/i] getting to attack first, before defending.
And came up with [i]Sentinel[/i] getting twice the defense value, when defending. I didn&#039;t have any Sentinels, so this hasn&#039;t been tested yet.

The helped a bit though, and makes the skills more useful and interesting.


Strange for some reason none of the online stores I checked, have both Fellowship saga expansions. Some have one and some have the other, but none have both..??? Except Amazon, but they want $10 more.

Some copies are still being delivered from the distributors, so hopefully some store gets both. Or I&#039;ll just bite the bullet.</body>

	<body>The last of his race, Deadline stood watch over the galaxy, waiting to intervene when he witnessed the beginnings of the kind of extinction event that had wiped out his species. One fateful day he foresaw such a fate for a distant planet, Earth. He set out to save the planet by attempting to destroy it, hoping to unite humanity in a common cause.

[imageid=2898678 large]

On Earth, Visionary, given psychic powers by U.S. Government experiments on her as a child, had a vision of Deadline&#039;s approach, which would spell disaster for the Earth. If he wasn&#039;t stopped, the Earth would be driven back into the dark ages, or worse. She gathered a team comprised of herself, Haka, a Maori warrior returned from the dead and dedicated to preserving the Earth and its people, and Omnitron-X, a rebuilt version of the deadly villain Omnitron, returned from the future to help humanity instead of trying to destroy it. 

[imageid=2898682 large]

Together they traveled to Wagner Mars Base, a hub of interplanetary research, to intercept and destroy Deadline and save the Earth.

[imageid=2898683 large]

A vicious battle ensued. Both sides took plenty of damage, but the real issue for the heroes was that Deadline was rapidly destroying Wagner Mars Base, ripping it to pieces around them. If they couldn&#039;t finish him off before the base was destroyed, they would all be killed and Deadline would continue on to rain destruction on the Earth.

With only one turn before Deadline completed the destruction of the base, the heroes managed to reduce him to 4 hp. Unfortunately not enough to defeat him. With one action left for Omnitron-X before defeat was upon them, the team held their breath.

Omnitron-X has a power that can reveal the top card of any deck and put it into play. 

[imageid=2898686 large]

Hoping to rely on Haka&#039;s abilities to cause damage, the team drew the top card from his deck, needing at least 4hp damage dealt to win.

[imageid=2898687 large]

In a final, blinding rampage, Haka defeated Deadline and his two remaining devices, damaging his compatriots in his fury. It was enough. The heroes stood battered but victorious in what remained of Wagner Mars Base. Earth was safe, for now.</body>

	<body>I played 3 games all at level 3.

[b]Game 1[/b]
This game went well and I managed to help Robinson defeat the pirates (10 cards 52 strength, 7 cards 16 strength).

Fighting Cards = 46
Ageing Cards = -5
Pirates = 30
Life = 40
Hazards = -21
TOTAL = 90

[b]Game 2[/b]
I seemed to be fighting a losing battle from the start as I barely managed to win any fights. Robinson ended up dead in the Red phase.

Fighting Cards = 36
Ageing Cards = -5
Pirates = 0
Life = 0
Hazards = -33
TOTAL = -2

[b]Game 3[/b]
This game was always going against me as I kept successfully winning fights for cards worth 0 but losing fights for cards worth 1+. Robinson died in the Yellow phase.

Fighting Cards = 28
Ageing Cards = -10
Pirates = 0
Life = 0
Hazards = -57
TOTAL = -39

:thumbsup: - Quick game that is easy to learn and play.
:thumbsdown: - The luck of the draw with both decks of cards can determine the outcome of the game early on.</body>

	<body>I had this game for some time unopened. It was a purchase from GMT&#039;s last sale.

I decided to read the first part of the rulebook and try the short scenarios (the rulebook is divided in 3 parts, the first one for scenarios 1-5, the second for 6-9 and the last one for the campaign game).

I must say that the rulebook and the scenario book are a labour of love. Every single step of the way is explained clearly in the rulebook even stealing a page from eurogame designs (the rulebook has space on the sides of the page for clarifications and examples à la Alhambra). The scenarios are well defined with the history of the raid.

But the gameplay is pure and simple not there. I tried scenarios 5,4,3 and they defy the definition of a game. A simple exercise of luck. Let me explain it for you. You are trying to bomb a dam, so you have to release the bombs, you can try to optimize when to release them, how? Well, you draw a chit, if you don&#039;t draw the good one, you try again, drawing another chit. Rinse and repeat until you draw the +3 chits. (there are only 9 chits I think so it is not even hard).

Ok. There is a little push your luck element in that (you have something like 1 in 100 chance of having a enemy fighter appear...)

Well, you finally release the bomb, and throw 2 dice. The modifiers are dependent on... wait for it... luck of the draw of chits (remember the plus 3? well that means that you draw 3 chits so if they are not good you are stuck). Ok, there is a minimum intervention.

But is that enough? No. You need to roll a die to see if you get the higher or the lower value of the chit (no modifier, plain luck) and another die (no modifier) to see if the value of the bomb magically goes up or down 1. Chits are normally 3-4 and you can get a difference of -2 or +2 depending on pure luck!!!

Some people might say (with some reason) but Antonio, you have only played the easy scenarios, you need to try the fly and the prep rules. But my answer is that I am not very interested. The Attack scenarios (the ones I tried) take place in every case, i.e. all the planning and all the flying is going to end up with the same pure dumb luck attack sequence.

I might try it, I am not at all opposed to exercises in accounting without any brain activity at all, but I have a lot of other more interesting games (and that use up less space)

This game is just B-17 with a lot of love for the subject matter. I fail to understand how on the year 2016 wargame companies continue to pour out this kind of games, and gamers still buy them.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve played this little game a lot this weekend. 11 times to be precise, and I finally managed to catch up with Judy&#039;s highscore of 28 (I hope you haven&#039;t played more and raised it? :devil:).
My scores were 27, 26, 25, 20 and 18 yesterday (I think it shows how I was getting more tired each game), and 18, 26, 22, 23, 24 and 28 today. Only a single card was driven outside the playing area in all these games.

So, what is the game about? Basically, it&#039;s a rather dry exercise in moving cards of one colour to a scoring area in the opposite corner, where cards of the second colour start out, and vice versa. (This is for the solo game; in the two-player game each player has their own colour.) Movement happens whenever there is a conflict. A conflict occurs when two cards that share either a letter or a number end up in the same row or column.
It isn&#039;t totally themeless. Cards are either a sandy brown/yellow or a watery blue, and the game is supposed to be about the ebb and flow of the tides. And while that isn&#039;t a lot of theme, I think the mechanics go fairly well with it. By playing a single card, and then dealing with the resulting conflicts, you can set of far-reaching ripples, because by solving one conflict, you can cause another, or several more.
This is what the game looks like in play:
[ImageID=2898906 medium]
[b]Pros and cons for [thing=1379][/thing]:[/b]
:thumbsup: It&#039;s a *very* small game. Just a pack of cards, smaller than regular playing cards. And [company=46][/company] don&#039;t waste any space with the box either. It fits the cards, but if you&#039;re just trying to add a player aid, it&#039;s going to be a tough fit.
:thumbsup: It plays quickly. I&#039;ve timed two of my games, and both were 20-30 minutes. You can probably take much longer if you spend more time looking for the optimal move and trying to remember which cards are in a pile that you have covered, but I like this as a relaxing game, not a memory exercise.
:thumbsup: There is something about both the theme and the mechanics that I find quite relaxing. I&#039;ve even played it listening to some relaxing ocean sounds music. For me it&#039;s a good game to play before going to bed, when [thing=134253][/thing] or [thing=100423][/thing] might provide too much stimulation but I still want to play something.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: I&#039;ve read someone say the game is too random and that there aren&#039;t enough choices to make - random in that what cards turn up when determines the outcome. While there certainly is *some* randomness, I think the fact that my scores aren&#039;t that far apart indicates that randomness isn&#039;t a huge factor. I can&#039;t complain about a lack of interesting choices either. Most often, when there is a conflict you have several options how to resolve it, and it also matters a lot in which order you resolve multiple conflicts, and which cards you cover up. Those decisions are often the difference between moving only a single card in a turn, or triggering a long chain reaction. It can also be the difference between getting a card to the scoring area and driving it outside the playing area.
:thumbsdown: If you want something heavy on theme and narrative, this isn&#039;t for you. Basically, they could&#039;ve used cards in black and white and made it completely abstract.
:thumbsdown: Playing needs a fair amount of concentration. It&#039;s easy to overlook conflicts if there are several ones, or if a card that has been covered gets to the surface again. Checking and rechecking to make sure you haven&#039;t missed anything can get a bit tedious. I&#039;ve also gotten confused about which colour I was moving to which corner mid-game once. :whistle:

[b]Summary: This one is a keeper. I can see myself playing it a lot when I want something short and relaxing that still has interesting decisions to make.[/b]</body>

	<body>I finally got done crafting this solo PnP game. It&#039;s an epic game--both in terms of how long it took me (the counters took forever to make) and in terms of learning the rulebook (not super long, but Eklund-esque in terms of trying to figure it out.

I&#039;m playing through the AAR the designer posted years ago and just playing it step by step as he wrote out, all in the attempts to learn the system. 

You are playing the human race who has been at peace for hundreds of years, and have lost your warlike tendencies, when XYL, an alien race has appeared on the scene to exterminate you. So, it&#039;s not just about fighting and winning in battles. You have improve Humanity&#039;s technology and weapon theory, you have to design warships, starting from scratch, all the while worrying about Humanity&#039;s Morale Level. Because if the aliens start kicking your ass too much, your morale will sink and you&#039;ll lose that way as well. You can defeat XYL by war, or by working on a Nano-virus, that you can perfect and inject into their society and hopefully die from.

I&#039;m still learning it step by step. So far its good. A nice heavy solo game.</body>

	<body>Andy: &quot;Micheal, if I may say, she&#039;s even prettier than you described her.&quot;

[imageid=2898918 medium]

So begins my journey with Flying Colors. This is a game unlike anything I&#039;ve played before (closest comparison is probably X-Wing) and I&#039;d be lying if I said I wasn&#039;t intimidated. Like many topics in history, naval combat and old wooden sailing ships are something I&#039;m fascinated by, but have done little research on. So when I saw that there are something like 4 pages of rules just on moving your ship, I thought, &quot;oh man... what have I gotten myself into?&quot;.

Lesson 1: &quot;Wearing&quot; is turning... at least... kind of?

I&#039;m working through the example of play and I&#039;ve gotten through the first British ship move.

[imageid=2898925 medium]

One hour well spent. What I discovered is that movement is actually pretty simple, though I haven&#039;t looked at the ship pass through stuff yet. What I really like about the rulebook so far is the 4th wall breaks where they tell you something like &quot;we&#039;ve abstracted about 50 things into this mechanic to make your life simpler and the game faster.&quot; This is not a game about [i]managing[/i] a fleet. It is fleet ACTION like it says right in the title. It&#039;s X-Wing with old wooden sailing ships and despite the intimidating rules, I&#039;m feeling pretty committed to it already.

Not sure what I&#039;m going to do when I get to the massive multi-map scenarios, though... :whistle:

[b]Update:[/b] Okay, finished the example of play, let&#039;s try this for real.

British get initiative and decide to play offense. The French flagship already has 6 damage to the hull so they want to see if they can get a quick victory by pounding it into the sea.

The plan actually works pretty well. The Formidable takes an additional 7 hits bringing it only 2 hits from &quot;damaged&quot; status. The Formidable and Mont Blanc conduct defensive fire, but unfortunately, it does little to damage the British command. End British phase:

[imageid=2899386 medium]

Now it&#039;s France&#039;s turn. The British have all fired so the remaining two French ships can blast away. The... [-]D-J (forget the name)[/-] Duguay-Trouin in front decides to turn into the wind and get into raking position on the British flagship. It aims for the rigging hoping to get some enhanced residual hull damage, but comes up empty. The British flagship does end up with 6 hits on its rigging, though.

The two middle French ships move forward and away from the British line hoping to regroup. The rear French ship Scipio moves forward and unloads on the third British ship, Hero. A fire breaks out on board. Fun!

End of turn, the fire is extinguished, but the French find themselves in danger of losing their flagship which will mean British victory.

[imageid=2899542 medium]

This game is indeed quite a bit more simple than it appears on the surface. There are still plenty of things I need to learn, but I&#039;m pleasantly surprised that I was able to get through this first turn with minimal rules referencing. Turn 2 should be fun.

[b]Update:[/b] Going to keep this short and sweet. I didn&#039;t realize a damaged ship would still have so many hit points so the British strategy of giving up position for firepower hasn&#039;t paid off very well.

The Duguay-Trouin who hit the British flagship (Caesar) from the front earlier spun back around with the wind and unleashed its fury once again. The French flagship (Formidable) has been beat up pretty bad, but she&#039;s heading off to open water while the Caesar sits like a fish in a barrel surrounded by the French (also on fire... fun!). The two other British ships are okay at the moment, but Hero has lost most of its rigging.

	<body>All chores done and no obligations at all for the rest of the day. So what to play?! You probably guessed already: Dr. Congo. DRCongo. Hope out of Horror. I just can&#039;t get used to saying it any other way. Doesn&#039;t make the game any less interesting.

I&#039;m not that big a fan on how the rules are written, with the different layers. If you want to set the game up, you look at the core game, then Insurgent game, Government game and finally the Ragnar game. You keep searching through the rulebook if you&#039;re looking for something, too. So not a huge fan of it. And even the complete, ragnar game isn&#039;t that difficult when it comes to the rules, so they should have just explained the full game and then offered easier versions after that. That would&#039;ve put everything in one place. But not that big a deal, just a bit annoying.

So, Hope out of Horror, how does that work? The Democratic Republic of Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, with enough natural ressources to rival the productive capacity of most First World countries. From the Belgian administration of King Leopold II, through the torrid times of independence and the horrors of two &quot;Congo&quot; wars, the country has seen its vast economic potential wax and wane and its citizens become some of the poorest in the world.
In this game, you play the part of an Industrial Baron determined to see this nation rise up and take its rightful place in the world economy. You must realize the industrial potential of DR Congo and develop cities to help combat the Insurgent menace. You will bring Hope out of Horror!

Haden&#039;t played it in a while, so I was happy to break it out again. I drew Paul Mbemba as Industrial Baron. First I thought: Oh great, only 10k$ starting money. But the great thing is, his start province is Province Orientale, which already has an export route.

[imageid=2898964large]

Halfway through the game I realised that occasionally I had forgotten to pay money when changing ministers, which is why I won&#039;t count the game as a win. I was wondering, why I was doing so well, turns out saving that much money can help you quite a bit to develop DRCongo. After realising that, I made sure not to make anymore mistakes but it got me too many medals and money. Will have to try again, maybe later tonight.


:thumbsup: Very great game with a difficult theme well done.
:thumbsup: Its nice having different layers but (for me), just playing the base game and leaving stuff out isn&#039;t that interesting.

:thumbsdown: Having to look through the whole rulebook to look for something. Its only a few pages, but I&#039;m looking for something negative here.
:thumbsdown: I like the cards and paper money (kinda fitting for this game) but the quality could be a bit better.

	<body>Captain America, Groot, Blade and the Hulk faced of against Mysterio who had the Hand Ninjas, The Sinister Six and a bunch of Irradiated Villains doing his bidding to bring the Clone Saga to fruition. 
Groot was the star of the show, collecting shards and using them to take it to Mysterio. He also managed to keep the the Shield folks off the front line so the true heroes could go to work. The hulk pitched in as well(even though he did manage to injure Captain America quite a bit).
In the end the good side won the day and Mysterio&#039;s plans were thwarted.

	<body>A new set of missions, so a new entry! This is a very interesting draw with two definitely separate paths. 

[b]Difficulty:[/b] Very Hard

[b]Easy Mission:[/b] 
Mars Survey (5)

[b]Medium Missions:[/b]
Phobos Sample Return (12)
Mars Lander (7)
Venus Lander (11)
Mercury Lander (13)

[b]Hard Missions:[/b] 
Mars Sample Return (16)
Man on Mars (24)
Mercury Sample Return (19)
Ceres Sample Return (14)

So, there are LOTS of Mars missions. If you only do the Mars/Phobos missions you get 64 points vs 57 points. However, there&#039;s only 1 manned mission! If I avoid that and just do a probe/sample based space program I can avoid researching Life Support (humans are so needy) as well as Surveying. I don&#039;t really care what&#039;s on the planets since it&#039;ll just be a point swing in my favor if say, my Venus probe is smashed to bits. 

I&#039;ve not done a probe-only Very Hard mission. I think some of the Medium difficulty missions wound up being probe-only, but were obviously quite easy.  So, that&#039;s what I went for. 

I almost made it. I lost 55-66. The Mars mission got to Earth orbit in 1977 (i.e. after the game had ended). I knew it wouldn&#039;t make it when it left, but I had to still try and still get the Mars Survey and Mars Lander missions. I think I might have still attempted Ceres Sample Return during some of those years, but part of that was spent trying to get the Venus program back on track (I did it with another Saturn 2-stager launching Atlases and a probe). 

I had 3 very critical Major Failures. 2 of my Saturn tests blew up on the launchpad with a bunch of probes on board. So, that ended up being about a $70 loss. That set my landing/rendezvous testing back and I didn&#039;t catch up well. I did finish landing testing with the spaceship en route to Mars. The other Major Failure was when the Atlas blew up in the Inner Planets transfer on its way to Venus. 

Still, that was really fun, and kind of neat to do it as NASA has been looking at in the last decade or so with &quot;Faster, Better, Cheaper&quot; as their mantra-or so I&#039;m told. 

Now, to go back and build the best Mars mission ever and see whether I can nab any of the other landers at least. 
[b]
Update:[/b]

A day late and a dollar short. Once again my missions (I managed a late launch of a Venus mission) arrived in 1977, so I finished with 12 points vs a lot. I wanted to make sure my landing etc was well tested and it was! My landing and re-entry were major failures on the last card! I had to sacrifice the Aldrin capsule (thankfully no bad radiation anyways) so that the Apollo would land/re-enter without issue on Mars. However, I miscalculated for the return journey. I needed 4 years with 3 ion thrusters. I left 1 year too late, I had hung out in Mars orbit with my team in order to vet everything. 

It&#039;s a &quot;sort of&quot; solo win. If I hadn&#039;t done the testing my astronauts would be dead, so I am pleased with that. 

I also think there must be a Soviet spy in NASA. My Saturn program is disastrous. I had 2 minor failures and then a major failure! At least this time I didn&#039;t lose 2 Saturns and 2 payloads. Yeesh.

[b]EDIT!:[/b]

By the way...the expansion has a BGG entry!!!!!  [thing=190924][/thing]

To say I&#039;m excited would be an understatement.</body>

	<body>...and yet another soccer season! #4 this month. I was bored last night and thought &quot;I&#039;ll just set up the board for the next game&quot;. Then it was &quot;might as well play the first turn&quot;, &quot;halfway point of the season would be a good place to stop&quot; and I ended up just playing the entire thing in one long, engrossing sitting. This is the first time I&#039;ve played this game with no breaks mid-season. And a lot of fun it was. 

I lowered the difficulty level back to my usual 2/2 after experimenting with tougher games in my last 2 plays. I decided to go for a passing skill strategy again, after seeing the players on offer in the initial board. This time it worked very well, by the mid-point of the season, I had a strong offensive team, with the defense being a little below par. Some deft maneuvering left me with the best team by season&#039;s end. This is the first time I have not had an empty player spot on my team board! I only sold one player all season. Tiles were also being removed much faster than in any of my previous plays - I hit the level 4 tiles on week 6 and by week 8, there was nothing left to purchase and only had to play out the games for the final 2 weeks. 

This is also the first time that I&#039;ve come close to having my team go into bankruptcy. I never had to play a penalty but on 3 occasions I went into the week&#039;s match, with a negative financial balance and the prospect of losing fans at the end of the week. It certainly made things interesting. 

We got off to my usual slow start, but started challenging for the league title about halfway through. We lost in 1st round of the cup  and in week 9 we also dropped to 2nd place in the league, leaving me with a winner take all game against the leader on the last day of the season, which we won in a thrilling 3-2 match. 

[imageid=2899227 medium]

Final scores: 

Blue/ME: 39  (league champion)
Black:   33  (cup champion and league runner-up) 
Red:     24 
Yellow:  18 (cup runner-up) 
Purple:  17
Green:   17 

Really fun ending - going into the last game, Black was actually leading me on points 32-31 and I had a fairly heavy wager/press-release in place that I had obtained near the beginning of the game, where I promised to win the league. 

The winning squad:

	<body>In the last few weeks I had become very interested in TAL. At first it looked a little intimidating but after viewing a few playthroughs it looked like a unique game the likes of which I didn&#039;t have in my collection. So last night I was able to set it up and have a great time with it.

I will say it took me about an hour to go from opening the box (traded for it so pieces were already nicely bagged) through picking pliots and aircraft to finally my first mission of day one. I decided to try Iraq in a Show of Force mission. I throughly enjoyed the process overall in selecting everything. Once I played through the mission it became very clear to me the importance of everything. 

I was able to buy an Apache, Cobra and a F-16. First day and mission saw my Cobra and F-16 against an support battalion. The anti air units were almost perfectly spaced out by the dice gods. My slow aircraft had no options for getting the drop on the enemy before taking damage. The same essentially happened the second mission and neither time was I able to even half the battalion. Wounded pilots. A crashed cobra and it wasn&#039;t a good sight. 

:thumbsup: critical decisions throughout with enough luck in the dice to be exciting or disappointed.

:thumbsup: I am not a wargamer typically but this does a nice job of allowing me to dip my toe in that water a bit.

:thumbsdown: setup time I am sure will improve as I play but it did take me a bit.

:thumbsup: the excitement of launching a missle and hoping it hits is palpable. </body>

	<body>Got my rear-end handed to me last night...drew 3 &quot;Don&#039;t Panic!&quot; cards in a row, only to be followed by having 2 threat dice stuck in stasis, and 3 of remaining 4 in infirmary.  Rolled only 1 die for 3 turns, until I got a medic die :(  (That&#039;s never happened before!)  Then the threat cards just started piling up, and I couldn&#039;t do anything...

So I switched gears, and ended up playing 2 games of [thing=159351][/thing], but similarly got it handed to me both games.  That &quot;Rip to Pieces&quot; card is just devastating, and, ironically enough, drew it both games :cry:  

Since by that time it was getting late, I decided to call it a night.  

0/3.  Terrible score.  But what can you do?</body>

	<body>Finally got back to this solo game of Churchill, using the &#039;box&#039; bots.  I am the Commies.

This was the 9th conference in the 3 conference (8-9-10) training scenario.  FDR died, and was replaced by Truman.  The Brits won the Agenda segment, but the SA won the conference.  The bots foolishly don&#039;t put &#039;USSR enters the war&#039; on the table, and I don&#039;t either.  Why let the US nuke Japan and take all the points?

Although I lose the conference I get the A-Bomb and some UK goodies to help me in Germany, so I am happy.

The war goes pretty good for the Rodina as well.  The Red Army gets to Prussia while the Allies fail to advance.  The Brits make some progress in CBI, and the Americans retake the Philippines.  My spies tell me the Americans have tested an atomic bomb, but I will gain more VP they they will, since they will be unable to drop it.

[ImageID=2899068 large]

I am not too thrilled with the bots.  The Allied bots have the bomb, are in a B-29 space, but there is nothing in the flowchart to tell them to try and pressure Russia into declaring war on Japan.  You can be sure a human US player would make the attempt.

Still, it is a good way to get a game of Churchill in if you don&#039; have room/can&#039;t find a game vs human opponents.

Playing by Vassal is ideal, you can break the game into 1 conference chunks and finish at your leisure without having to leave the game out.  The Vassal module does much of the lifting for you.</body>

	<body>I need to catch up from a wild weekend of solo gaming and non-solo parties that I have been participating in the last few days.  With this in mind, I will reporting on three game sessions, hopefully before the weekend is over.

To start things off is my return to the Valley of the Kings, Afterlife.  In my previous January report [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/202271/item/4380931#item4380931](here)[/url] I mentioned the solo game was far to easy and I would follow-up report on the &quot;Master Solitaire&quot; level.

After playing the Master level of this game twice my view of it as a solo experience is that it plays like a puzzle solver, in the range of a medium-light sudoku.  As long as the player is willing to take their time and not do anything that would irrevocably burry a needed card there is no way to lose the game.  Valley of the Kings is not bad, and it will stretch your mind muscles at the level of an afternoon walk so playing it on a plane or at the park would even work (if that is your speed).  

I want to try Valley of the Kings with multiple players because it seems like having some competition for resources would add greatly to the variables and tension.  I like that it is a small footprint game that has elements of deck-building and set-building (much like 7 Wonders Science).  There are also a few elements made to grief opponent&#039;s but they are not numerous.  Over-all it has the qualities of a good game but I cannot recommend it to someone whose focus is primarily on a solo experience.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been looking for a meaty modern-era tactical wargame and the Lock &#039;n&#039; Load series caught my interest given all the reprints they&#039;re doing now. I&#039;m a huge [thing=243][/thing] fanboy and that will probably always be my go-to tactical system, but I&#039;ve wanted something a bit easier to get on the table when I don&#039;t want to burn my brain too much.

After my first play, I&#039;m still very much undecided on the LnL system. I played the first scenario in the book for [thing=184561][/thing], &quot;Ap Bac,&quot; which is an ARVN assault on a VC-held building. It&#039;s a straight-up shootout, with each side getting victory points based on units eliminated and, for the ARVN, whether they control the building at the end of the game. The ARVN have two M-113 armored personnel carriers and a few crappy machine guns, while the VC have a couple of their own MGs, a sniper, and a mortar.

Suffice it to say I didn&#039;t think this was a particularly well-designed scenario.

[ImageID=2899507 medium]

As the ARVN, I tried sneaking half my force around the far edge of the map, out of line-of-sight of most of the VC units, with the other half moving up behind a hill on the other side. I kept my two loaded APCs in reserve for the first turn, waiting for a good opportunity before committing them.

Ultimately what happened was a nasty exchange of fire on the side of the map where I had squads trying to sneak through, and eventually I committed both APCs to the fighting on that flank. A couple things happened there that made me question the rule set a bit: first, fire attacks resulted in a shaken VC unit (stacked with a Good Order leader), and I advanced an ARVN squad into melee, looked up the rules, and found that Shaken units and leaders without their own Special Weapons are automatically eliminated in melee! That seemed a bit silly.

Then, after another melee in which the VC got the short end of the stick, I found that the ARVN were ahead in victory points 11-5. This was the end of turn 4 with ARVN forces only about halfway to the objective building. Yet because of the way the scenario victory conditions are written (only the ARVN, not the VC, get victory points for controlling the building), it meant I could simply withdraw the ARVN forces, out of reach of further VC attacks, and have a comfortable ARVN win. I never actually needed to attack the objective building.

This was compounded by the fact that the VC get 4 victory points for each eliminated M-113; no VPs are offered for forcing an M-113 to be abandoned. And unless I&#039;m misreading the rules about small arms fire vs. armored vehicles, there is actually no way for the VC to eliminate either of the ARVN M-113s short of close assaults. They don&#039;t have any weapons that can outright eliminate an armored vehicle - only cause it to be abandoned, which is not the same thing in my reading.

[ImageID=2899508 medium]

A couple other things felt weird to me but are much less important: the mortar seemed way more powerful than it should be; and it&#039;s very difficult for squads to rally after being Shaken (at least compared to in ASL); and I found it a little odd that Spotted counters go away after every turn, so units in non-open terrain have to be re-spotted every turn. 

Long story short, I was not super enthralled by this system, but I&#039;m willing to give it a couple more tries, hopefully seeking out some better-designed scenarios. I&#039;m sure I also got a bunch of rules wrong, so some of my complaints might actually be completely unfounded. I&#039;ll play a few more times before letting myself jump to any conclusions, especially since LnL Tactical seems to be a reasonably popular system.</body>

Adventure: [b]The Hook Mountain Massacre[/b]
Scenario: [b]Battle at the Dam[/b]
[color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] Turn #13


[u]Analysis:[/u] Those damned Ogres attack the Dam. Their leader, Malugus Kreeg is not as strong as its brother Jaagrath. [b]Seelah[/b] is going to start at the Shimmerglens, as she had no weapon in her starting hand. [b]Merisiel[/b] is going to start at the Garrison.


[u]Story:[/u] The first turn for [b]Seelah[/b] was just amazing. She acquired 2 blessings and 1 ally that allowed her to encountered 5 cards. The fifth one was an Ogrekin that made her bury her armor. And on her second turn, she encountered a Kreeg Ogre and managed to close the location. She moved to the Guard Tower. There, she managed to defeat another henchman and close the location on her second turn. Of course, after such a good start, the issue of the scenario was quite known. [b]Merisiel[/b] didn&#039;t performed well on her own, but she managed to keep enough life to temporarily close the Garrison when [b]Seelah[/b] encountered Malugus Kreeg. The second check was close, but she did it for one of my fastest win.


[u]Power feat:[/u]
[b]Seelah[/b]: (or Spell) when discarding the top card of her deck for 1d6.
[b]Merisiel[/b]: +2 when fighting alone and recharging a card.


[u]Acquisitions:[/u]
[b]Seelah[/b]: B. of Shelyn
[b]Merisiel[/b]: Black Arrow Ranger
=&gt; I hesitated with Jakardros Sovark, but this ally seems too situational.</body>

Sadly the good guys didn&#039;t do much.

Pyro came into play quickly. He hurt the good guys pretty bad with some sidekicks. They got dropped down to 3 Life.

Daredevil and Punisher finally brought the bad guys down to 6 Life.

But...

Kingpin arrived. If his 4 ATTACK was Blocked, he&#039;d immediately take 1 Life.

That and his double damage Sidekick spelled the end.

[imageid=2899550large]

Brilliant evening of fun with this great horror story-telling adventure. Played as three randomly chosen characters: Kevin the lifeguard, Sherry the orienteer and C.J. The [-]token[/-] coach/athlete. Set up &quot;The Campfire&quot; which begins with Otis, the killer, glowering at the trio from the darkness of the tool shed. 

I split the team up to go on their treasure hunt (they need the keys from counsellor Morris&#039; hut - which is always my opening play) and then two other items. They need a combination of three items to access one of the four different end-game scenarios (and there are currently eight in total in the base game box). 

It&#039;s really vital that you scavenge for a weapon, early on, as you&#039;ve no chance of even holding Otis at bay without. C.J. lucked out with his first exploration revealing a butcher knife. Sherry, unfortunately, drew a cameo card on the next turn, bringing up Officers Jenkins and Taylor - who randomly spawned right next to the coach and promptly confiscated the only weapon we had. 

And I didn&#039;t see another one until two turns from the end. Thanks, boys. 

[imageid=2899531large]
[i]Obviously I&#039;m above any such comments about &quot;The Man&quot; keeping a young black man down. Ahem.[/i]

Pretty much every other exploration turned up bodies or rumours of Otis&#039; legacy, and my terrified trio stumbled through heavy fog and a downpour. I was lucky enough to discover a first aid kit, which the constantly weakened Kevin had to keep circling back to. So many blunders saw the lifeguard lost in the woods (and I forgot about Sherry&#039;s orienteering skill in the heat of... well, not battle, as such. Cowardice?). Head counsellor Morris arrived, slowly patrolling the camp in search of young children (actually, I find him even less wholesome than Otis), and then Detective Haddon blundered into the camp, pursuing his old vendetta against the killer. 

I found everything I needed to start The Van escape plan, hustled everybody to where they needed to be... and then this happened:

[imageid=2899553large]
[i]And that&#039;s the point that shit got ugly...[/i]

Kevin, who had been killed once but resurrected with a &quot;We thought you were dead!&quot; card, was propped up in the doorway on a single point of health. Sherry screamed as Otis crashed through the door whilst, at the same time, Detective Haddon burst in from the opposite end of the common room. C.J., brandishing the only weapon they&#039;d found - a meat cleaver - stepped up to defend the group. At this point, Otis was massively powered-up, he rolled a D10 to the cleaver&#039;s D6+1. The coach rolled a 5... to Otis&#039; 8. I played the &quot;Desperation&quot; survival, card to force the killer to reroll. So he took it to a 10. C.J. panicked - which inflicted the single point of damage which finally killed him... 

Sherry, played the &quot;Gimme&quot; card to snatch the cleaver from C.J.&#039;s crumpling body, for a free move, and then took a turn at defending against Otis. She rolled a natural 4... and the killer fluffed it and rolled a 2. Success! Sherry saves the day and Otis retreats.

Sadly, this then activated the detective, who is a little loose with the trigger. He crossed paths with Sherry... and put a bullet in her whilst aiming for Otis, and killed her too. 

Kevin just kinda shrugged, picked up the gear and started the finale alone. Incredibly, on one point of health, he survived to the penultimate round, but finally succumbed to the natural order of things. 

This game!

	<body>Suburbia has been getting a lot of play at our boardgaming group during the week, usually with a new player each session - a couple of the players have really been taken in by it, and for good reason as it is a brilliant game.
However, as I usually end up bringing along something else I end up playing something else, so haven&#039;t been involved in any of these games.

I have really been liking the Lone Architect solo variant of Suburbia, so have been playing that instead. The -2 penalty for crossing the red lines is quite challenging, and makes beating your previous score even more satisfying.

[imageid=2899687 medium]

The abundance of commercial buildings is due to the commerce challenge - 5 blue for 4 Reputation is not too hard to achieve, and when playing Lone Architect you do need all of the extra bonuses. Not getting either the Bonus or Challenge can put quite a dint in your score. My favourite borders are the Desert and radioactive Wasteland. The +5 Income that they provide is usually too good to pass up early game. The beach here didn&#039;t give me much extra bonus population, but it did provide the reputation when I needed it.

Very happy with how that game went, with a final score of 84. And the lighting was good enough for a photo too :)

:thumbsup: Mechanics and Theme really mesh well together. The more your suburb grows, the less desirable it becomes, which the population track implements really well. You have to keep at it to keep the residents flowing in.
:thumbsup: Borders are a lot of fun and add a lot to the game. I don&#039;t think I would ever play without them.
:thumbsup: Bonus&#039;s and Challenges are also a nice addition from Inc. No extra compelxity, but an additional goal to work towards (/compete in multiplayer)
:thumbsdown: Setup can take some time, especially if you are mixing 5:nostar: in as well.

	<body>So my time on vacation has been spent sleeping and diving for the most part, but today I managed to get  game in. Couldn&#039;t remember which solo trial I left off at, but was pretty sure it was trial 6 so that&#039;s where I started from. I find the Atlantis and Xanadu maps fairly easy, but that El Dorado map seems to be my sticking point.

 I played 3 trials and got stumped once more on El Dorado, so I packed it in. Playing near the beach has some issues: the wind can be strong and everything from the tables to dock floors have water slots in them and I feared losing pieces, but I was fine. The sun gets quite warm too, and I didn&#039;t want to burn, so I only played the 3 games.

 I actually had another tourist stop and watch a bit and ask some questions. I offered his to play a 2 player game, but he quickly declined, which was probably for the best. Explaining innate and alternate attacks to an 80 year old might be an effort I&#039;m not ready for today, lol.

	<body>First-time playing this interesting PNP game.    It had caught my eye a few times in the past on SGOYT lists, but for one reason or another I never got around to trying it until now.

Several stops needed to be made along the way to consult the rulebook and there were a couple minor things that I got wrong along the way (usually not too late to correct).  By the end I managed to find, activate, and link all 6 Constructs, but with a Final Activation difficulty of 18 there wasn&#039;t much that could be done.

Final score was [-]114[/-] [i][b]140[/b][/i], but having never played before or really looked at what other people did, I have no idea how good or bad that might be.


Overall I liked this and will definitely be giving this and the Beast Hunter sequel/spin-off a few more tries.  


:thumbsup:  The search mechanism is pretty interesting, and it provides a lot of good decision points to make along the way.
:thumbsup:  The combat system is simple but very efficient, and ties in really well with searching.
:thumbsup:  Could be a great option for teaching/practicing basic math without feeling educational.

:thumbsdown:   As nicely as it&#039;s dressed up this is still a dice fest, and even though you do have a fair degree of control, success or failure ultimately still depends on what you roll.  At one point I managed to defeat a Level 5 monster without taking a single hit...   then rolled a 6 to see if it dropped the Legendary Treasure.
:thumbsdown:   It was a much longer game than I&#039;d anticipated.  It didn&#039;t overstay its welcome, but it felt like you could chop off between 1/3 to 1/2 of the game and still get the same effect.  (Maybe Beast Hunter changes this?)
:thumbsdown: (Minor) I didn&#039;t like how you&#039;re going for the lowest possible (closest to zero) results with everything [i]except[/i] the Construct links, where you want the highest numbers possible.



Questions for anyone that&#039;s played this a bunch:
1)   Do you have to connect ALL of the links, or do you only need to have everything connected to the system?   Being able to ignore one of the redundant links would have meant my Final Activation value could have stated 4 lower - still difficult, but not impossible.
2)  When an item or event gives you -10 to a search result, does that ALWAYS subtract, or is it meant to flip the other way when your score goes negative in order to push you closer to zero?
3)  There was something else - I&#039;ll add it if I think of it.</body>

	<body>Got in a a game this afternoon and it went fairly fast. My dice rolls for air attacks were hitting very well and had a decisive effect on the ability of the North Vietnamese units to cause any trouble at all. This coupled with a lack of reinforcement cards coming out of the OPFOR deck meant that by the time the game ended, I had a Strategic Victory well in hand.

This is a lighter solo wargames but I enjoy it. Sometimes it&#039;s nice to sit down, set up a game, and an hour later you are done and all cleaned up.

:star: Quick set up and gameplay
:star: Nice mix of ground combat and air interdiction. Highlights the fact that airpower can make or break the success of the U.S. 
:star: OPFOR card draws add a nice bit of tension at times as you simply have no solid idea what to expect.
 :nostar: rules can be a bit hard to get sorted out.

	<body>Been doing some more testing of my [thread=1523665]Ticket to Ride AI[/thread] that I have been working on, in this case the Europe map to determine if the Tunnel/Ferry rules work. Overall I have been happy with how it&#039;s been performing, and while I was tempted to tighten one of the changes I made, I have gone back to letting the bot ignore the ferry and tunnel rules without any restrictions. The latest game was with 2 bots (both the same version) to see how it would work, and apart from a luck issue which I need to address (and upgrade the bot to version 1.14 by adding the stack overflow rule to it) I am pleased with how it went. I think I will soon be moving onto more interesting maps.

	<body>I wasn&#039;t really sure if I ever wanted this game and not being able to easily  find the Avalanche expansion helped me keep my money. However, I was sucked into buying the complete series (my sickness won out) when the Avalanche tiles showed up again in the BGG store. 

I played my first game tonight of the base game, easy side with summer weather tiles. I didn&#039;t do too bad for a learning game. The rules are simple and the solo version follows the main rules almost exactly. In the solo mode you have to draw a risk token every turn unlike in multiplayer, but otherwise their the same.

The game started out rather lackluster and I was afraid I had grabbed the whole series prematurely. Luckily as the game progressed I started to get in the grove, watching the weather, planing where to climb, how far to push it, when to back down and how to best make use of my tents. 

Now I&#039;m rather pleased with my purchase and can&#039;t wait for a few more games to see it holds up. I did make the mistake of only apply the risk tokens to the acclimatization chart and not allowing myself to deduct from movement or acclimatization cards. I think this made my climb more difficult than it should have been. 

:thumbsup: Simple rules
:thumbsup: Nice components 
:thumbsup: Turned out more tense with more choices than I thought at first
:thumbsdown: Normally not of fan of get your best score for solo games, but I think this one works for me so far

The title of this particular session should be [b]Dice Hate Me[/b]. Cuz they really do.

Early in the war, according to table you use to roll, 50% of the torpedoes are duds. When you fire them from medium range, you have about a 50% chance to hit, plus or minus some modifiers. If you fire from both ends of the sub on the surface at night, you can unleash ten ([b]10[/b]) torpedoes on those fat, lucrative cargo ship targets. I did, and repeatedly scored exactly [b]1[/b] damage hit point with such a salvo (you roll for damage, too). After finally shaking off the destroyers and repairing what I could, I repeated the strike, with the same results. Had to basically use every fish in the boat to sink one stinking ship.

But never mind. On my last patrol, I rolled a 12 with 2D6 for a random event. Then rolled a 2 for a Gigantic Freaky Wave, for a random crew member to becme KIA. Then rolled 1 with 1D6 for the Commander. Uh oh. But luckily, I had a Rabbit&#039;s Foot to save the day and used it for a reroll. And guess what? Yes, you guessed it, 1 again. Game over. Why is this happening to me?

So yeah, dice do hate me, but it&#039;s still a great game, like the predecessor. Better luck next time (you wish!)

Tonight the team of Nightmist, Fanatic and Unity took on the villain Progeny in the Tomb of Anubis.

[imageid=2900068 large]

Things went downhill pretty fast for our team of heroes. First Unity was KO&#039;d, then Fanatic, leaving only Nightmist (at 4 HP) to face Progeny, who was still at 50+ HP.

Luckily Nightmist managed to transform into Mist Form, making her immune to damage but also preventing her from playing cards or using powers, plus an environment card prevented her from drawing cards.

[imageid=2900071 large]

Using her fallen compatriots abilities to heal her a little each turn, Nightmist stayed in mist form hoping to regain some strength. Fortunately the environment deck was almost entirely in play on the table.

[imageid=2900073 large]

As she rebuilt her strength, Anubis and the other creatures and mummies in the tomb slowly whittled down Progeny. By the time Progeny forced Nightmist to regain her physical form it was too late for the villain. Anubis himself struck the final blow and took out Progeny.

A close and precarious victory with only one hero left standing.</body>

	<body>Two games of this tonight, with both the [thing=166679]Gates of Arkham[/thing] and [thing=137479]Unseen Forces[/thing] expansions.

Game one saw Gloria Goldberg, Wilson Richards and Monterey Jack taking on Cthulhu himself.

[imageid=2900078 large]

[imageid=2900079 large]

First Gloria was devoured, then Monterey Jack. Finally Wilson was devoured in R&#039;yleh and the world was consumed by the Great Old One.

[imageid=2900083 large]

Game two saw &quot;Skids&quot; O&#039;Toole, William Yorick and Rita Young facing Shudde M&#039;ell who slowly destroys the world as you play (failing an adventure card means it is not replaced, shrinking the tableau).

[imageid=2900080 large]

[imageid=2900081 large]

First Rita, then William were devoured or driven insane. When Shudde M&#039;ell finally awoke, Skids was forced to face him alone.

[imageid=2900089 large]

Shudde M&#039;ell completely destroyed the world long before Skids could do any significant damage to the ancient god.

I love the Gates of Arkham expansion, makes this game a lot tougher and more interesting. Looking forward to the upcoming [thing=189807][/thing] expansion which brings yet another location and some new mechanisms to the game. </body>

	<body>Saturday morning this expansion (together with 2 Khan character for MK, 2nd story and urban structures for Flash Point and Leia Organa and Echo Base for Imperial Assault) arrived. The wife had to work on Sunday so I opened the table and gave it a go whilst taking care of the baby.

I really enjoy this game so my opinion is naturally biased.

I played against the Dark Pharaoh because I wanted to check the new board. The Prelude card (ended up being very relevant) brought in a North wind, that put up a Rumor that brought up a special monster to be fought. I thought it wouldn&#039;t be a problem as my hitman (Hank Samson, the rest of the team were Min, Rex Murphy and Sister Mary) was two spaces away.

But then the game played one of its tricks. First Mythos card, discard half of your items. All my team members only had 1 item so they discarded them all. Hank lost his weapon, and had no strength to fight the special monster.

At least the first mystery went by quickly. Second mystery fight The Beast. A combination of Min (adding one die), Rex giving the gun (+5) to Sister Mary and her own good die roll killed the Beast.

So I was down 2 mysteries and with the omen track at 12 thinks look promising. But with 3 Rumors, and 2 of them with special monsters (one in Rome from this expansion), things could turn up badly. As they did.

The last mystery had me searching for cultist in the special board. Had a location encounter, trade in a clue and beat a cultist. Easy pease, right? Well, not really as I needed 4 victories (I misread and thought only 2 were needed so I got cocky).

I sent Min and Rex to fight the menace in Rome whilst Hank was doing... nothing. He broke his leg twice (broke it, mended it and on the next turn broke it again), impaired his strength and, in general failed to do anything at all. Sister Mary was going for the Mystery. First turn, good, second turn bad, third turn good....

But whilst this was going on the Rome special monster had killed the 2 investigators and one of the replacements (Monterey Jack) died almost as quickly. The Omen track was going down quickly when one of the Rumors had to be resolved... minus 3 health. 2 more investigators out of it, including Sister Mary...

Things looked grim, but I managed to score 2 more victories against the Mystery. If I could resist (Omen 3) the mythos phase... Another reckoning effect. The last rumor solved (minus 6 health, 3 more investigators dead, plus some 2 more omen descends from the omen symbol)... I decided to quit there. I wasn&#039;t bothered to pick up 3 new investigators (at this stage I had already lost 8) and the baby was getting hungry again so I called it a tie.

(yes, I cheated but it is my game).

I can only dream of playing with both boards on. Although I should try first to play it with just 1 character to really make sure I use everything. When I play with 4 I am pretty sure I don&#039;t optimize as well.

	<body>Between Saturday and tonight I got in four plays of The Bloody Inn.  I am at a point where I want to experiment with different strategies.

144 Hazardous Innkeeper: This was a warm up game so I had nothing specific planned in advance. Personally, I value scoring &quot;Hazardous&quot; as a minor defeat at this point with the rank of &quot;Evil&quot; needed to claim victory.
153 Evil Innkeeper: Rather than treat all Level 3 characters as murder targets I tried to get useful one&#039;s in play as Annex&#039;s. This was easier than I thought but in the end I overproduced and there was empty crypt space.  I want to try this again with the Level 3 acquisition number toned down slightly.
130 Hazardous Innkeeper: Small Ball strategy of playing numerous Level 1 and 2 characters as Annex&#039;s. There is an economy of action issue that makes me think playing small may just have a slightly lower scoring threshold.  
160 Evil Innkeeper: Played this with a Big Game Hunter strategy. During the early game I focused on acquiring the 2 cost Annex&#039;s, particularly Abbots.  The end game was simply murdering big money characters and burying them in the crypts I created with the aid of my accomplices.

	<body>I haven&#039;t been playing many solitaire boards games this month. This War of Mine was released on the Xbox One and I&#039;ve been absorbed by that. It is one of those rare video games that has engaging game play (I&#039;ll just do one more day....) and really makes you think about the consequences of your actions. As civilistation collapses and my three survivors start to starve are they prepared to steal knowing that doing so could result in others starving? They&#039;ve yet to face the ultimate moral dilemma of whether they are prepared to kill if things really do get bad....how much of their humanity are they prepared to sacrifice to survive?

I&#039;ve also started running a Judge Dredd campaign for my RPG group and preparing for that and writing scenarios has taken most of my gaming time this month.

I did make some time this weekend for a couple of plays of Chris Alton&#039;s [thread=1519350]One Day Mage Knight Challenge[/thread]. His challenge is that you only play the first day on the game and see what kind of score you achieve. I don&#039;t normally go for solitaire games where the goal is to beat your own score, and generally prefer challenges that have a win/loss condition after which scores are compared with other players. So it was a bit weird for me playing Mage Knight without a specific win/loss condition!

I&#039;ve played a far amount of Mage Knight but I&#039;m a long way from an expert (which is one of the reasons I love this game: it is such a deep game that I always feel I have more to learn from it) and one of the nice things Chris&#039; challenge did was to really focus on optimising my turns. When playing the full game I tend to have marks I try to hit each day/night but always with the the focus of the long term plan. This challenge removed the long term plan and really drilled down to the fine details. I was quite surprised how much it is possible to achieve in one day!</body>

	<body>Finished a normal game session of this over the weekend, inspired by watching the Ant Lab games video play-through.

No pics, because my intention with this post is to ask a question: is anyone else left with a &quot;meh&quot; feeling after the playing this game?  I am able to recognize the cleverness of the design, but it just does not appeal to me.  I might need to recognize that I am not a euro-gamer and stick to thematic and war games.

Is the epic game that much different that I should force myself to play again?  I say &quot;force myself&quot; because quite honestly, I am not eager to get back into it.

Another issue: the extensive set-up and break-down requirements.  :cry: </body>

	<body>I set up for the medium scenario, A Better War (1968-1972) with the Period Events.  I played as the NVA versus three bots.  My previous two plays had been with the VC, so this was a new side for me to learn.  It took me a little while, but I came to realize that patience was what would be rewarded with this side.  I spent a lot of time building up forces, trying to set up for my Pivotal Event, Easter Offensive.  When I could, I mainly targeted the US forces, given that in solitaire play there is no early victory, but instead you have to play through all of the Coup cards.  Causing US casualties not only reduces the US score and ability to conduct operations down the road, but also limits the amount of Aid to the ARVN forces.

It took unexpectedly long for me to be able to play my Pivotal Event, as I had to protect myself by taking a few event cards and trying to avoid getting trumped (which I was at one point by the VC&#039;s Tet Offensive) given that the bots always play their Pivotal Event when you are the first eligible player.  The VC weren&#039;t much help in this game from a control standpoint, but they did a decent job of removing support.  They spent most of the game heavily resource constrained, so were never a threat to win on their own.

I was finally able to line up an effective time to play Easter Offensive, which knocked the Americans more of less out of the game.
[ImageID=2900284 medium]
[size=9][i]American casualties adding up post-Easter Offensive[/i][/size]

I was sitting pretty heading into the second-to-last Coup card when the US unexpected rolled to LBJ from JFK (only a 1 in 6 shot of that happening).  Given that the US had lost a ton of their Troops to this point, a roll of Nixon (4 in 6 chance) would have removed all US Troops from the map and greatly hindered their capabilities!  Given that their support was so low, this would have been perfect, as their score still would not have been very high.  Even the status quo of JFK would have left the board to my advantage.  LBJ, however, exposed my massed troops to brutal airstrikes, and the addition of US Troops to the board meant that the US could still be effective (though they ended up paying more attention to the VC).

It ended up being a bit more of a struggle due to damage to the Trail and American airstrikes, but I managed to pull out the victory!  The final score was VC: -13, NVA: 4, ARVN: -10, US: -15 for National Liberation!   

The board at the end of the game:
[ImageID=2900285 large]


Up until this play, I had really struggled with this game.  The bots take a lot of work and a lot of time to implement correctly.  This game was on my table for 10 days and I played it every day.  I would estimate that this medium scenario took me [b]over 15 hours[/b] to complete.  Some of that has to do with getting reengaged with the game after being away from it for a day, working through the strategy or the bots&#039; priorities again, but often it was struggling through the bot rules step by step.  I really do believe that I am executing them correctly, down to the proper sequential or nested priorities, but it does not come easily nor do I feel will ever be able to be done without a lot of flowchart and/or rules referencing.

The change is that now I think I am okay with all of that.  What was very frustrating in my first two plays was the feeling that I was doing things improperly.  Now, as long as I am willing to invest the time, I feel that I am playing the game as it was meant to be played.  I am not the type that would want to play this multi-handed.  Nor I am the type that could just shrug and feel that I am playing the rules &quot;close enough&quot;.  I think I&#039;ve just gotten to the point of understanding of the bots that if I work through them slowly enough, I can execute them properly.

This was a great play of this game.  Fantastic really.  Working through the strategy is great.  Sometimes I would sit there for 15 minutes thinking about what move to make next, trying to think turns ahead (playing against the bots leads to a bit of this analysis because it is easy to determine what operations they will conduct for their next turn, but I didn&#039;t find myself trying to game this [which you could only do in a limited way anyway]).  When jogging in the morning, or commuting home at night, I would find myself considering my next move when I returned to the board.  Given my earlier frustrations with this game, I went into this play as sort of a make-or-break for the game and me, and it came through the other side looking better than ever.</body>

	<body>Despite being felled by the dreaded lurgy, I did manage to finish the Liberty or Death multiplayer playthrough. Certainly seems easier to wrap my head around than Andean Abyss - fewer initial options, perhaps.

But enough was enough, so I packed it away for a real play in future and broke out Roads &amp; Boats. Picking up on someone&#039;s wise advice, I played through the worked answer for a SGOYT challenge. This gave me some insight into how you have to think backwards, and I demonstrated my complete failure to really internalize this knowledge when I tried the beginners&#039; introductory scenario and scored in the solid double figures...

Finally, prompted by the prospect of it being the featured game on the latest Heavy Cardboard podcast, I broke out Troyes, re-read the rules, and then let Shadi Torbey&#039;s Le Roy bot stomp me into the dirt of Champagne. (Listening to the Heavy Cardboard folks later I did wonder if I was playing the same game...)

If I can find a spare room to put the Roads&amp;Boats box in I can see it getting into regular rotation. L&amp;D is going to need a free afternoon+evening (i.e. a blue moon). Troyes moves up the queue to be taught to a group.</body>

	<body>Finally decided to print, glue, cut, and sleeve this puppy yesterday...took between 2-3 hours!  But it was so worth it :)

Got in my first game just now, and had to post.  Scored 51 points, which according to the Solo Rules, makes me a &quot;City Builder&quot; (the second highest tier out of 5), and anyone &quot;would be proud to call this [city] home.&quot;  

Not bad for a first go, assuming I was playing all the rules and solo variants correctly (which I&#039;m guessing I probably didn&#039;t).  But I think I did, for the most part.  

Some friendly BGG responders (you guys are all awesome!) clarified a rules issue for me with the Mill, Mine, Laborium, and Farm cards...now I can use that to my advantage next go arounds :modest:

Anyways, great little game, can&#039;t wait for my copy to come in this fall, and if you haven&#039;t, y&#039;all should consider backing on KS - mechanics are very different from its predecessor, VCK, and we&#039;ve smashed all stretch goals...game&#039;s gonna be AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[i]EDIT[/i]: Almost forgot, I was able to use gold coins from Talisman, which makes me happy on multiple levels :D</body>

	<body>Finally got around to posting for my first foray in SGOYT!

If you&#039;re a solo gamer I believe you will find this to be an excellent game to solo. The activation phase of the game has you drawing HQ chits either by Division or Army. There is a command radius for the activated HQ in which it has direct control over units. This lends very well to solo play as you have numerous Allied and German Division and Army HQ chits to pull. Also, there is a chart for the defensive posture of either side, followed by the specific mission of that battle. During my gameplay I just rolled for an overall posture for both sides “Aggressive”, and then rolled their defensive mission during each encounter. Missions are selected for both the attacking and defensive player. I choose the offensive posture while as noted above I rolled for the defensive. 

[IMG]http://thesolovariant.com/images/IMG_0257[/IMG] 

Speaking from the solo side, there are games that state 1-2 players with the caveat of &quot;Play to your best ability&quot;... during the course of playing Winter Thunder I honestly felt vested in both sides and did not have a tendency to favor one over the other. The activation step really can surprise you as a solo player and you have to be very adaptive for both sides, so I feel it lends itself very well to solo play. I also felt like the defensive chart was a good idea and had no issues with it as it never felt odd or out of sorts when sorting out each engagement.

	<body>I&#039;ve been trying to hunt down this white whale of a title for while at a decent price (HA!).  I succumbed and bought a French version La Gloire de Rome (Filosofia) at a very fair price ($28) which on the plus side features arguably much better art than the original english version.

Took it for a spin using the very involved [thread=695608]SoloPlay [/thread] rules by [user=gamerulesforone][/user] 
and it was quite the undertaking, in an awesome way!  

If you ever tried to grok any of his SoloPlay variants, you know that your head will spin!  They are not for the faint of heart; the opposite of simple.  But man, once they click...  

There I was, sitting with a spreadsheet that I prepared with translated card names from french and the rules.  On the other hand, I had the SoloPlay manual.

[ImageID=2900774]

These are some of the most engaging solo variants I&#039;ve played in a while!  Real fun!

After four tries, I finally beat it!  If someone is interested, I wholeheartedly recommend this variant.  

Anyone interested in taking the French version road (it&#039;s not as in short supply as the english version or Black box version), please let me know, I can share the excel spreadsheet with the card list translation.

	<body>Finally broke down and played this. I received late last week and decided to watch Box of Delights playthrough Saturday night. Set up and played Sunday. Had to restart once I discovered a huge rules mistake I made. I then set up and played again. This time I finished losing in the 2nd scene. Although I think I would have lasted one more turn I was off on the staggered rule. 

Lots of little things but i&#039;m sure will all work out with a few plays. I enjoyed the process.

First impressions.

I like this game. I look forward to just knowing the flow and the rules and there isn&#039;t an issue but I am aware that comes with a few plays. I like the money system for card buying and the ability to use the card immediately on your next turn.

:thumbsup: fast unique fun deck builder
:thumbsdown: Playing the cards on the obstacle you are attacking. Several times I caught myself discarding those cards to the runner they were facing instead of the runner that played them. My fault just a small gripe.
:thumbsdown: turn / scene / crossfire level tracker. So much seems dependent on the turn level or the scene level or the crossfire level and there isn&#039;t any great way provided to track that. I can use dice or tokens or count the crossfire deck but a thoughtful disc or card with those items listed and trackable system would have been nice. </body>

	<body>Bagged this in the most recent UK maths trade (I also have TAL and the last of the Pathfinder card games on their way from SGOYT celebrity [user=garyrbrooks]Gary[/user] :laugh:). Thought I&#039;d take it for a spin before tea and was quite pleased with how it played. Gives a nice hint of hand management and some thinkiness in its 5-10 min play time. I had two games, the first of which I struggled manfully with, and then got to the 1000 mark with my second.

First impression were good - I&#039;ve been very much enjoying some lighter solo fare recently and this will slot right in alongside the regulars I think.

	<body>Added this VPG title to my stable during the last sale (it wasn&#039;t on sale but helped me get a volume discount). Punched and cleaned it up yesterday and proceeded to get completely hammered, not even making it to election night. In reading the designer notes it says the game was influenced by the SOS games after Israeli Independence was released and that is quite evident. It&#039;s certainly not an SOS game but it&#039;s damn close.

I decided to run again over my lunch break, playing as the Republican challenger to the President seeking re-election. This time I did make it to election night and garnered 146EV from my hard work on the campaign trail but unfortunately it was not enough.

The game is pretty interesting, using a selection of &quot;Inter-News Daily&quot; cards mixed in with a small fixed event deck for each game will keep it fresh. In this second game I spent a little more on the Opposition Research cards hoping to get some help there - I think it certainly did, there&#039;s a decent mix of minor help in there, a few busts and then the surprise cards which really give you a boost.  I like the mechanics around being in Ad or Campaign mode on each track very much. I haven&#039;t included the candidate cards yet or any optional rules but I will after another game or two to make sure I&#039;m doing everything right. [b]Edit:[/b] For example, in this 2nd game I skipped the Home Stretch part which would have had me play two more cards from the reserve deck. Oops.

So far so good, I&#039;m looking forward to further exploration of this game.

	<body>The signs are appearing, Cthulhu is coming out of his slumber, and it&#039;s up to Norman Withers, Lily Chen, and Jacqueline Fine to stop him.

This was my fourth attempt at Cthulhu, with the previous three ending in a world of insanity...  I typically had investigators going crazy left and right, so I switched up my starting line-up.  Norman replaced Charlie Kane, who would supply my fighter with all sorts of nice weapons and then completely cease in utility until he inevitably went insane.  Lily replaced Skids O&#039;Toole, who was a serviceable fighter, but Lily&#039;s ability to quickly upgrade made a huge difference.

The first mystery was &quot;The Deep Ones Attack&quot;.  Norman buffed his own strength with Feed the Mind, and took on a debt to get a very nice weapon and become a killing machine.  Jacqueline fed Norman and Lily a constant stream of clues, and the deep ones were sent back to their watery graves.

Next was &quot;Watching the Stars&quot;.  This was Lily&#039;s show, with a little help from Norman in Tokyo.  After buffing in Australia, Lily took on a weakened Cthylla and dispatched her quickly.

Finally, the team had to solve the &quot;Threatening Seas&quot;.  Each member had a clue, a spell, a focus token and were in the heart of a storm.  With time running out, they all managed to complete their work and thus end the threat to the world.  Alas, before the end, Lily was devoured due to a dark pact that Norman had to make.  Her sacrifice will be remembered.

With that, I&#039;ve managed to beat all four base game Old Ones.  Since I have Strange Remnants and Forsaken Lore integrated, I&#039;ll probably face Syzygy before a showdown with Yig.

Obligatory monthly theme pandering:

Others have said it well, but it&#039;s essentially a deck-building co-op with some nice hand-management and similarities to [thing=135382]Shadowrun Crossfire[/thing] (not least in the difficulty!)

I had 3 games on &#039;Easy&#039; - I&#039;m not entirely sure where that difficulty rating came from as I got smacked about in all 3 games, just managing to hold on for a victory in the last of the 3. This game is BRUTAL. It feels less so than Shadowrun possibly as there aren&#039;t as many card draws to hit you over the head during the course of the game, but every single turn of the game something bad seems to be happening to you - so much so that I&#039;m not sure how much fun I had playing it ultimately!

:thumbsup: Looks great
:thumbsup: Quite intuitive once you get going, and an interesting way of using the theme
:thumbsdown: Really, really hard
:thumbsdown: Those tiny sodding euro cards

	<body>Played a couple of hands this weekend, using the solo variant penned by [user=ricky2002][/user]

[url]http://www.boxofdelights.net/arboretum-solitaire-variant/[/url]

I slightly tweaked his version to make it a [b]vs AI[/b] solo variant instead of [i]beat your high score[/i] variant.  

I called this version [b]&quot;The Garden of Non-Forking Paths&quot;[/b].
You play against a dummy player called Q.  Q&#039;s arboretum looks something like this:

[ImageID=2886387][size=9][i]image credit: BGG user shfrost.[/i][/size]

[b]Set Up
[/b]
Create a deck that uses 6 colours, as per the 2-player game.  Deal yourself a hand of 7 cards and then deal 1 card face-up to create a discard pile.

[b]How to Play[/b]

As per the regular rules, on your turn you will:

(1) Draw 2 cards, one after the other, with cards being drawn from the face-down deck or from the top of the face-up discard pile (notice there is only one discard pile in the solo game).

(2) Play a card from your hand into your arboretum.

(3) Discard a card, except the discarded card does not go to the discard pile. Instead, it goes into a face-up tableaux that represents a dummy player’s arboretum. We call that dummy player “Q”.

[i]Q has face up cards (her arboretum) made entirely of your discards, and face-down hand cards, made up from cards drawn in step 4, and it is with these cards that Q will challenge you to the right to score paths during the scoring phase.
[/i]
(4) Instead of adding two cards to the discard pile (ricky&#039;s version), add only one and draw the other card face down to form Q&#039;s hand.

By doing this, you won&#039;t have perfect information of Q&#039;s hand, just like in the regular game. A lot of the game&#039;s tension comes from not knowing what&#039;s your opponent holding on to until it is too late!


[b]Scoring:[/b]

-At the end of the game, for each type of face-up tree with at least two cards in her arboretum, Q attempts to score that path following regular scoring rules. (This includes 1&#039;s and 8&#039;s scoring, as well as doubling the value of the path if 4 or more face up cards.)

-Q scores the path only if he has the highest corresponding value in her hidden cards compared to your end game hand. This encourages you to prevent Q from scoring those paths, per regular rules. 

-To win, you must meet two conditions:
[i]a- Score at least the same number of paths as Q.
b- Beat Q&#039;s score.[/i]

Using this tweak to ricky royal&#039;s solo variant, it feels as if the solo game holds similar layers and nuances as the regular game. Now you really need to pay attention to what&#039;s in the discard pile, as well as to carefully manage which cards to hold on to, as you are actively trying to deny paths to Q. </body>

	<body>Having solo playtest fun with [b]Cataclysm: A Second World War[/b].

The scenario I&#039;m playing is called Hitler&#039;s War, a very nice &quot;global but not quite&quot; scenario involving all the big powers except Japan, but only on the European side of the map. The scenario sets off in 1939-1940 and so the fireworks are about to go off soon too.

The Soviets get to an interesting start pushing with the Red Army, not into Poland, but South East forcing the resource rich Iran and soon also Turkey to join the Communist fold. The British controlled Iraq and the Middle East stand by nervously.

Seeing the Soviets choose that course of action, I have the Fascist play a diplomatic game bringing neutrals to their side, not by the sword but by the word, as it were. Let the Soviets exhaust themselves in military adventurism. After a while, a coalition of the willing stretches from Sweden down to Libya. The Fascist also take a small but steady VP lead.

The Democracies get to a quick start as relatively soon France and the UK seal an alliance. The US, however, shows little interest in the events in Europe only very reluctantly sealing the Lend Lease to materially support the Democracies in their efforts.

Eventually, the Fascist VP lead sees the Democracies pull the plug and declare war on the Fascist alliance of Mussolini and Hitler. Game on.

Scenes from the game. Non-final playtest art.[/center]

Italians bear the first brunt as the superior British army stationed in Egypt takes the Italian colony of Libya without much effort at all. The Italian navy responds by taking the Mediterranean under Italian control cutting the supply to the British in Africa.

Next the poweful British navy stationed in Scotland clears the North Sea of German control. The Germans fear a British invasion and plans are underway to seal the invasion path, but it&#039;s a race against the clock.

In the space of a very dramatic couple of chits, first Stalin agitates for a declaration of war against the Democracies, but the Supreme Council rejects the idea for now. The British sense trouble brewing, pressure the US to join the fold, and bang, in a sudden change of pace, the Americans join the war in Europe!

Can&#039;t wait to see how this one pans out in the end.

:thumbsdown: When my chits just refuse to get pulled out of the cup has had me scream in frustration. Ask my neighbour.

:thumbsup: Love it how each game of Cataclysm is so different from each other. There are so many paths that they game can take. Tons of replay value in the box!
