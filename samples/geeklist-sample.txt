With the CoH Solo expansion on its way, I&#039;m daring myself to play nothing but it this month on my [i]table[/i]. It&#039;s set up right now and I&#039;ve gotten in one learning play of the first scenario.

I would probably play other smaller games as well, but might leave this out as my one &quot;big&quot; game of the month.

Ok, August&#039;s self-challenge to play 4 different games worked well. So here&#039;s mine for September:

Any game I add to this list this month, I need to play at least 3 times. And I must add at least one game (none of this 0x3=0 nonsense).

If I do not, I&#039;ll randomly pick one person who has played one game the most (or tied for the most), and give them 50:gg:.

Breadth last month; depth this.

For those interested (hopefully many of you), Ninjadorg&#039;s game Gloom of Kilforth is on Kickstarter. A chance to help the little guy for once with your hard earned money. It&#039;s been steadily climbing, but we need to spread the word to have a chance of it being made.

You need:

One or more holiday locations away from distractions.

A wife, husband or partner who has no or little interesting games but is happy to let you play.

A car full of solo/solo-able games.

Full or occasional Internet access to update the con geeklist or blog.

Yay, September!  Fall, my favorite season, is just around the corner.  It&#039;s been so hot and dry in the Bay Area, I am really ready for a change in the weather.

I am *really* excited about the upcoming holiday weekend.  I&#039;m finally going to do my one day Sologameapalooza!  Only games I already know the rules too.  I have yet to put together the list, but I can&#039;t wait.

I&#039;m still plugging away through my [geeklist=195355][/geeklist] list.  September will be about seeing a few more of these played, plus giving the others I&#039;ve recently played some more table time (so I don&#039;t forget rules!).

Holy moly. That&#039;s the best sounding thing I&#039;ve ever heard of in my life. I have visions of me sitting at table with a glass of wine in a 450 square foot cabin just off the coast of Lake Michigan. 

I just felt my life goals altering within me.

Two games that will likely be on my table/tablet:


[thing=133038][/thing].

[q]NDIANAPOLIS -- August 13, 2014 -- Obsidian Entertainment, the developer of Fallout: New Vegas, South Park: the Stick of Truth and the Kickstarter phenomenon Pillars of Eternity, announced that they have entered into a long-term licensing partnership with Paizo Inc. to produce electronic games based on its popular Pathfinder Roleplaying Game intellectual property.
 
Obsidian&#039;s first licensed product will be a tablet game based on the highly successful Pathfinder Adventure Card game, a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players. Players each have a unique character composed of a deck of cards and a set of stats. Characters have classes such as fighter, rogue, wizard and cleric, as well as numbers that define attributes such as strength, wisdom and charisma etc. Players will be able to customize their deck to better suit each individual’s vision of their character.[/q]

[thing=154013][/thing].

[q]Stoic&#039;s tactical role-playing, Viking-themed series The Banner Saga is getting a miniatures board game adaptation called The Banner Saga: Warbands, the developer announced today.

Stoic, along with publisher Versus Evil and board game maker MegaCon Games, will work together on the project. Few other details about Warbands are currently available, though it is expected to gather funding via Kickstarter &quot;soon.&quot; A website for the game is currently online.[/q]

I dig that soundtrack too. Sylvian did a guest appearance on a Ryuichi Sakamoto record called Heartbeat too. Great song:

I still think my favourite Sylvian was Secrets of the Beehive.

I also enjoyed Last of the Mohicans (great film too), but nothing holds two sticks and a purple elephant to The Mission  :D

Has Jeremy Irons ever been in a bad movie? I think not.

The Mission is a great soundtrack too, I haven&#039;t listened to that one in years.  Glory, The English Patient, Master and Commander...love those.  I also really enjoy the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, a lot of the Star Wars music, Brenden and the Secret of Kells, Gattaca, Henry V, and We Bought a Zoo.  For awhile there, I was only listening to soundtracks, especially when I was in grad school (great for studying).  Now I still have my short list that I listen to often, but I&#039;ve really come to enjoy new age/spa music.  Which sounds kinda cheesy, but it is *so relaxing*.  I really like the music that has some kind of water (or rain) noise in the background.  Aaaahhhhhhh....

I was never into Shakespeare until I saw Kenneth Brannagh&#039;s versions. His Henry V is one of my favourite films.

The Easy Rider soundtrack was the 4th album I ever bought (1969) and I still have it

One of my favorite soundtracks ever. So beautiful. [/q]

Featured one of my favourite directors, (Beat) Takeshi Kitano as Sgt. Gengo Hara. An excellent film with an soundtrack. I rank it with up there with my favourite performances in Brothers, Zatoichi and Kikujiru.

Glory and Trek 2, James Horner - a tragic loss when he died.

Blade Runner - Vangelis - I still have a load of his albums in the attic.

Edward Scissorhands - Danny Elfman at his most magical.

John Barry was massively talented, with beautiful or iconic pieces among those many soundtracks.

Joe Hisaishi needs more exposure, but has done some beautiful work for Ghibli and other projects.

And mostly unknown in the west is Tenmon. Give him a piano and he can break your heart with three notes.

I was taking apart my printed copy of Bios: Megafauna (because I own an actual printed copy now) so that I could use the sleeves for other projects and was set to ditch the paper when I thought, maybe someone in the guild would like them.

So, would anyone like a cheaply printed copy of [thing=97915][/thing]?

You will get:  A deck of paper cards cut by hand.  The card sizes are not uniform, they are meant to be put into sleeves in front of other cards to make their backs uniform.
Two piles of cardstock, one green and one orange with paper glued to one side to be the Mesazoic and Cenazoic tiles.

All will probably fit in a smallish envelope, so I&#039;ll ship it free to the US/Can.  If you&#039;re elsewhere, I&#039;m sure we can work something out.  You&#039;re all nice guys/gals.

Keep in mind, this isn&#039;t well done by ANYONE&#039;S definition.  This was more just so I could play it by hand &#039;cause I loved the game so much.  The printouts are a little blurry, so you may need to reference the Vassal mod if you&#039;re unsure what a card says.  It worked enough for me, though, so if you&#039;re not picky, there you go.  

You&#039;ll need to get yourself quite a few different colored markers for your meeples and either print out a copy of the board or get the Bios: Origins board from Zazzle and play on there (the latter is what I did).

Let me know.  First come first served.

Good news: saved myself $50 by dropping my Prime Time pledge (game looks awesome but just won&#039;t get played)

I have to say, Gloomhaven looks like it could be really, really, really good.  I&#039;m not sure another game has tried to do what it does with the campaign system, in a solo-able format.

I&#039;m definitely in.

I pledged, then backed out. Mostly I have that Viticulture Essential Edition to blame. Plus I backed Forge War by the same guy. There are no benefits to backing. It&#039;s going to fund and Forge War showed up at Coolstuff, I suspect this one will as well. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, I like everything I see about Gloomhaven, but I can wait.

It&#039;s not due until May 2016 so waiting is what everyone will have to do and like you said if it follows a similar pattern to Forge War it will be out in retail only a short time after KS backers get their copy.

That being said I might still back it. :shake:

I LOVED D&amp;D.  We used to play on a weekly basis as kids and I have so many good memories of the time we spent playing it.

Our group also tried out lots of other RPGs.  To be fair, some of them were really fun and gave us some hilarious stories but despite this, the only RPG that lasted in our group was D&amp;D.

The great thing about RPGs is that it can cater to so many different styles of games and gamers.  If you aren&#039;t comfortable pretending to be someone else, then you can just play the character with your own personality.  At that point, you&#039;re not really pretending to be someone else.

Alternatively, there are lots of RPGs with are focused on combat (either abstract or with miniatures) so the RP side is less of a focus.  In fact, that is how we first played D&amp;D as kids.  The GM purchased adventure modules and we would just run around the dungeon causing mayhem and killing orcs, zombies, skellies etc.  At this point, its almost equivalent to a boardgame but with consistent heroes getting more powerful as you play.

Awful, awful movie[/q]

And I assume many on here had played and were right into D&amp;D at at least one point of their lives as it was such a big thing. I started in &#039;79 and recently got back into 5th edition. I used to watch the cartoon and even liked that. So when this movie came out in 2000, I was so stoked, even though I hadn&#039;t played in years.

Yes but I didn&#039;t enjoy that kind of game where I just &quot;saying&quot; what I want to do and so on... maybe It&#039;s just lack of imagination, too much abstract to me (even if, as I said, I read lots of books...).

Maybe miniatures could be better, anyway I don&#039;t have friends that plays RPG so... :D

  I started playing when I was 7, we got into so many arguments with the DM in those early days (we didn&#039;t think to use miniatures to keep track of positions).    
  There was a second movie they put out straight to television.  Even though the production values are crap I felt it had way more of a D&amp;D vibe to it.  It&#039;s pretty b-movie bad, so don&#039;t expect it to blow your socks off, but they do stay truer to the setting .

I dig that soundtrack too. Sylvian did a guest appearance on a Ryuichi Sakamoto record called Heartbeat too. Great song:

Now for anybody who has played D&amp;D for a while, a movie I&#039;ve really enjoyed because I can identify with so much of it is Dorkness Rising. I was in tears at some points, because I&#039;ve seen it in games. Like the guy who sees a peasant and starts with his fireball spell right out of the gate.

Why has there never been a decent D&amp;D style TV series?  The box set era seems ripe for it.  All it needs is a bit of Fugitive, Invaders style weekly adventures with an over-arching storyline tied in with some Game of Thrones style un-sentinmental main character killing offs.

With the popularity of GoT it wouldn&#039;t be a stretch to add a bit in the way of dungeon adventuring.

As an aside, I became very quickly bored with The Chosen One storylines (and I have a feeling lots of people did too) - the lad/lass/hobbit from the prophesy that would be born-to-save-the-world-but-grew-up-not-knowing-it nonsense.  I much prefer every day tale of adventurers having adventures that may or may not be linked style-ee.

Just keep in mind Ibbo, this is no Hollywood production. More like something you&#039;d see on the internet, but it hits a lot of stereotypes in our D&amp;D sessions at least. I swear the bard is one of the players in our group in disguise.

We had an excellent dungeon master. He turned all the lights off and just had a small torch behind his DM screen to see by, and had a generic sound effect tape playing in the background. We didn&#039;t use maps or minis and he kept track of all the character info. The sensory deprivation meant that there were no visual distractions and we could see the action more clearly in our minds. All we had to focus on was telling him what we wanted to do. It was a truly amazing experience.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/182184/item/3805551#item3805551

Many of my sessions were played with adventures that I wrote myself (see especially #7, #8, and #9), and someday I may write them as actual quests/acts/stories and upload them here, but in the meantime, if anyone wants to try them out, based on my reports, feel free! And let me know how your heroes did.

I&#039;ve been playing [thing=159228][/thing] on my PS4 lately (on sale right now for $13.49) and it is a pretty fun board game.  It feels like [thing=27627]Talisman[/thing] with all the things I don&#039;t like about Talisman removed.  You get action points for movement instead of random movement.  The map is hex based so you can move anywhere.  It is still very luck based, but you can mitigate your luck with cards and even burn any card to add extra dice to a check.  Even though a lot of the quests and events are random, you still have control over your victory path and decisions.

It evokes an experience similar to [thing=96848][/thing] though much simpler.  The goal is to save the king or kill the king (plus some other ways to win beyond that).  The King hangs out in his castle and causes problems on his turn.  Assaulting the Castle is like attacking a City in Mage Knight.  You have to strengthen your character first before you have a chance to win.  Will you take on a quest?  Explore a dungeon?  Claim a settlement?  Attack another character?  Or other stuff.

It is really quite fun and very much a digital board game.  Also you play big animals.  Check it out!

I had the same reaction Phil.  I was initially intrigued but the small map and the repetitive game play got to me after a while.

I see [thing=182715][/thing] is now out, so I&#039;ll be playing that for a while.  Last time I was a Decker, this time I might try Mage or Shaman (if those are the correct terms).

Doesn&#039;t bother me since the maps are randomized each game and I&#039;m a trophy hunter so I have my &quot;campaign&quot; sort of.  The tutorial they added for release shows that they could do a scenario based campaign.  So hopefully they have that on their to-do list.

Shadowrun: Hong Kong is quite good so far even if it doesn&#039;t feel all that different than Dragonfall.

[q]Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States. It&#039;s not an election game. It begins after you&#039;ve been elected. It&#039;s about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game, where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda, and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a &quot;different every game&quot; story, you&#039;ll either be thinking &quot;POTUS? Piece of Cake!&quot; or &quot;Why was it that I WANTED this job?&quot; many times in each game.[/q]

One nice things about getting a game through GMT&#039;s P-500 system (other than the discount) is that each fall they have a sale that gives you 50% off any of their in-stock games for each game you P-500&#039;ed that year.

[q=&quot;suzyvitale&quot;]Hey Rev, nice looking overtext!  :D[/q]

Thanks Suzy! It is all because of you and a few other generous donors, plus a handful of session reports that I earned GG for. Now I come with a built in apology... :p

[q=&quot;repairmanjack&quot;]After waiting a bloody age, Legendary Predator has been despatched (along with At the Gates of Loyang). Both should be here tomorrow. 

Same day my wife arrives back from Germany. Uh oh. I feel a game of &quot;Shelf Tetris&quot; coming on. [/q]

Two parcels, sent at the same time, from the same online store. Royal Mail tried to deliver today when I was out. They left Loyang with my neighbour and took Predator back to the depot on the other side of the city. Two cards left in my door to tell me about this... both stamped with the same time. 

Top trolling, Royal Mail. Top trolling. :shake:

Hey look, I&#039;m crafty!  Never made a PnP before, and I found this quite enjoyable.  Looking forward to playing once the glue has dried.  Really gorgeous tiles (even though my cutting/pasting isn&#039;t that great).

	<body>Today I tried my hand at deckbuilding, having only previously played &#039;Journey through Mirkwood&#039; using the monosphere decks included in the base game.

I went for a Leadership and Lore deck, mostly because Aragorn was, is and probably always will be, my favourite fictional character. Supporting him I had Theodread and Denethor, with Gandalf showing up when help was most needed (&#039;A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.&#039;  It&#039;s true too.)  Maybe not the most thematic group of adventurers, but I thought their abilities would all work well together.

And I romped through the quest, even dispatching an Ungoliant’s Spawn without too much trouble (gotta love the Forest Snare).

I had hoped this game might scratch the Magic: the Gathering deckbuilding itch that I&#039;ve been experiencing lately, and it felt really good to be looking at a fresh set of cards and trying to work out synergies etc.  I guess highest praise I could give is to say that I was looking for some MtG cards on Ebay earlier and quickly switched my search to LotR:CG expansions.

As for waiting; although I had seen Talisman on shelves I never really knew what it was about until GW released their 3rd Edition and ran articles in White Dwarf related to the game.  It really excited me, but as I was only about 15 and didn&#039;t have a proper job, by the time I had saved up the money [thing=1634][/thing] had been released and I bought it instead (because it seemed closer to the WH world, I loved Heroquest and mainly because it weighed more).  It would be another 18 years before a friend of mine would turn up to one of our games days with a copy of [thing=27627][/thing].  We had an absolute blast that day. </body>

	<body>Being in the UK, I&#039;ve had to go on my own incredible expedition to get hold of this; I&#039;m ahead of those poor buggers who kickstarted it only because I bought it from the U.S., via a seller through the geek market. Been unpacking it and thumbing through the cards. The rulebook looks a lot more dense than I&#039;d anticipated, so I&#039;m going to be moving into it during daylight hours tomorrow. (Start the month as you mean to go on...)

First impression: the quality is magnificent. Everything is really robust and sturdy; the card art is gorgeous - unusually so for having live actors in them, but there&#039;s a quality to everything that suggests it&#039;s been in the hands of perfectionists. Ok, the cards are a little thinner than some, but they feel solid enough. Only downside would be my exotic, sculpted dice - which is so warped that it&#039;s unusable. I&#039;ll throw in a spare and see how it goes getting it replaced.

Really looking forward to working through this (and the two expansions).

I very much dig this game, and it&#039;s become one of my favorite &quot;quickie&quot; games solo, as I can usually get 2 or 3 games done in 60-90 minutes.

Luckily, the die is hardly ever used in the game (in my experience), so it&#039;s not a huge loss. The game is a lot simpler (especially solo) than the rulebook would indicate, so dive in!

I&#039;ll be diving in just as soon as I finish pre-ordering the new Splotter game! Preorders are up on their site. I&#039;m not hunting through the second-hand markets for this one.

I am one of the poor buggers who backed this.

UK &amp; EU backers like me were charged for this TWO YEARS ago and we STILL haven&#039;t received our games.  The vague &quot;you&#039;ll get your game shortly&quot; communications are becoming less and less frequent (last one was 3 months and counting).  In the meantime the game is being sold on Amazon and at conventions.

It&#039;s absolutely disgraceful and it feels as if Liz Spain and her fellow perpetrators have taken our money and run.

So forgive me for not being over enthused to see this game on SGOYT.  If anyone doesn&#039;t yet have this game, please do me (and all the gamers who were ripped off) a favour - don&#039;t buy this game and don&#039;t give the people who stole from us any more money.

Sorry to hear about your problems, and didn&#039;t realize the history and ongoing issues.  Looking for any good reason to avoid buying this game, and this certainly qualifies!

Let us know if things get resolved for you - hoping you&#039;ll get your games!

The Grand Tour edition with special components was delayed due to unforseen issues with the original production company. They ran into so many problems with them they had to switch companies and start over.  The base game that is being sold now I believe has been shipped to all the backers? 

I&#039;m still patiently hopeful.

Nothing has been confirmed as shipped to all the EU / UK backers.

The last update (over 2 months ago) suggested they were maybe going to start shipping at some vague non-specified point in the future.  And we&#039;ve heard nothing since.

I&#039;ve asked for my money back but I&#039;m honestly expecting Liz Spain to ignore my request in the same way she&#039;s ignoring everyone&#039;s repeated requests for any sort of update or communication.

Love the game as well. Despite the complexity I find the game completely immersive. I have 5 or 6 games completed but I always thought it would be great to have an experienced player sit by the table and moderate a game of mine - to catch any mistakes and clarify rules issues - . Assume Judy has a lot more plays then 6. Same goes for CARRIER. Another great game :-)

	<body>I finally pulled this bad boy off the shelf again. After seeing [user=masil][/user] showcase his COIN games the last few months, I had to put this one into action for a couple of reasons:

1) I got the C3i extra goodies for this, the updated &#039;bots, and the &#039;bot Government, so you could play any faction, which I have wanted to do since I got the game. So, in my current game I&#039;m playing FARC.

2) I&#039;m sick of Cuba Libre. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love the game. But for the last year-ish I have taught numerous newbies a COIN game, and of course that is always Cuba Libre. Great game, but I&#039;ve played that so many times now, I don&#039;t want to touch it for awhile. Also I think the Syndicate is probably the least interesting COIN faction to play, and when I play CL I dread having to take them. 

So I&#039;m playing Andean Abyss because I wanted to get a different COIN to the table (I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll round up 3 other players to give this a whirl--it&#039;s time some of my COIN friends graduate to AA).

My game so far:

Agreed.

A Distant Plain is my favorite, but they&#039;re all good.

I had selected Andean Abyss as the COIN game I am going to ignore for financial reasons (cannot afford them all, especially if you live in Europe). But just last night I found myself downloading and studying the rule book, and now I see this entry. Those are omens, right? The universe is trying to tell me something here.

The AA reprint seems to be far off still though, mere 71 preorders in the P500 list right now.

Reprints on P500 never have to make it to 500. I believe all the COIN games are getting reprints in 2016, 1Q.

That would be great if all COINs get reprints at the same time regardless of the preorder numbers. I imagine it a tough decision for GMT, though, to produce a game with 71 preorders and push other titles with several hundreds preorders more further back in the production queue.

That said, it&#039;s not that the Ruhnke production facility is not delivering the goods for GMT. I mean, looking at the P500 list right now, it&#039;s striking how well his games and franchises are doing. LoD and Falling Sky, together with the expansion for Labyrinth, all are at or over 1200 preorders (this is probably about as high as the best selling GMT titles get). Most other COIN titles scrape the bar at 300 to 500 preorders including the expansion to Cuba Libre.

Oh yes, I&#039;ve kept a very close eye on the GNT updates lately (there&#039;s a new update due any day now). I do hope the reprint materializes in Q1 for AA, because the reprint date has been pushed back a few times already.

	<body>I&#039;m waiting for my copy of Gears of War to arrive so it will be on my table in September.  I found a copy in the marketplace and snatched it up.  I just got the notification that it&#039;s been shipped.  I&#039;m pretty excited about this one. 

I&#039;m also waiting for my copy of [thing=102253][/thing] to arrive in the mail at any time.  That KS is being fulfilled and I expect it soon.

Yeah, given that it was print on demand rather than printed by batch, it isn&#039;t likely a stash will turn up somewhere.

That said, I hear there are plenty of good missions available online and it isn&#039;t much of a miss.

Btw, TRP (actually, i&#039;m just gonna call you Trip), the mission pack is nothing special. A couple new missions, only one of which is good. No AI cards are used from the base game (three general AI cards included with the pack) and it uses the minis in weird ways, like how some minis use X&#039;s wound markers but drop weapon Y. None of the stuff can be added to the base game.

Nay nay, the base game is where i&#039;ll sink my time.

	<body>So I was perusing Fantasy Flight&#039;s new line of offerings, specifically [thing=181521][/thing] and [thing=181530][/thing]. This led me down a rabbit-trail of FFG&#039;s back catalog where I bumped into Rune Age. I had run into Rune Age in the past and had always decided to pass it up. The game seems to have a very loyal following, but a lot of posts and reviews I saw were pretty &quot;meh,&quot; so Rune Age has always sat just outside my wishlist. But since reading about WH Quest and Runebound got me all fired up for a new fantasy game, and since Rune Age was selling pretty cheap, and since it appears the game is now out of print and probably won&#039;t be as easy to find in 5 years, I decided to go ahead and grab a copy. 

[b]Mini review[/b]
It&#039;s weird that FFG named this as a 2-4 player game when it actually has official solitaire rules built in. And they&#039;re actually [i]good[/i] solitaire rules, not a cheap variant tacked on as an afterthought. 

At its heart, this is a 3-currency, Dominion-style deckbuilder where there are stacks of cards on the table for you to purchase. Some of the cards are race-specific and can only be purchased by the player controlling that race, and some are universally available. Some of the cards you purchase go into your deck; others (namely, cities and strongholds) stay out on the table and give benefits every turn. In the coop scenario, you draw from an enemy deck that does all sorts of nasty things to kill you, and on your turn you fight back to try to survive. Standard stuff, right? But to me, in practice this does not feel like other deckbuilders on the market. For starters, your deck stays small, as cards you draft in are constantly being killed off. In fact, if you don&#039;t watch out, your deck can dwindle to nothing. Second, each race&#039;s set of cards interact in different ways, making you stronger in some aspects of the game and weaker in others. Third, the game does not &quot;autopilot&quot; itself, which a big complaint I have with other deckbuilders. The best choice to make is not always obvious; the game injects some chance into combat encounters, so you&#039;re often called upon to weigh the risk/reward of certain actions vs others. Also unlike a lot of other deckbuilders, the order in which you take your actions makes a [i]huge[/i] difference in your success or failure.

Got its expansion [thing=124300][/thing] on the way, plus a whole buncha card sleeves; I have a feeling this one will be around for a while.

:thumbsup: Official solitaire rules that actually work well.

:thumbsup: The game is scenario-based, so when you are tired of the solo/coop scenarios, you can also recruit some friends to play competitively.

:thumbsup: Feels different from other deckbuilders. You&#039;re doing deck-buildery things, but it feels more like you are playing your own unique deck instead of the whatever was available to smash together.

:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Has a bit of a learning curve. A little more involved than most deckbuilders.

:thumbsdown: Only two scenarios that are soloable, even with the expansion.

:thumbsdown: The scenario decks are pretty thin (maybe 15 cards or so), so not the greatest variety within scnenarios.</body>

A perfectly fine deck builder and scenario based which makes things a bit different. I enjoyed every play.

Just too limited in terms of replayability compared to Legendary Marvel and some of the races abilities and cards you can buy don&#039;t really work perfectly solo.

That&#039;s why it went on its way.

i think you can get 15 or so plays out of it solo, just trying out different factions.  Very satisfying over those plays, then you sell it for half (keep yer kids away :) ), and it&#039;s quite a good value for the money and time spent.  (And don&#039;t really need the expansion if getting one&#039;s money&#039;s worth is a major factor.)

So agreed it probably isn&#039;t something you would keep forever, but by then you&#039;ll want the money and space for something else anyway! :cool:

Yeah, admittedly variety is a problem with this game. Only two scenarios and 4 races, and each race has only a small pool of cards to pull from. So maybe not as much staying power as the Legendary games. But I only paid $24 for my copy new, and I think Rune Age is a strong rival of games at the price point.

I&#039;ve had over 50 solo plays of Rune Age, and I&#039;m not tired of it at all. There is also a really good adaptation of a third scenario for solo play. (Look in the BGG forums for the Monument solo variant.)

15 plays seems pretty glancing: You wouldn&#039;t even get to win at both of the standard solo scenarios with each of the races at that rate -- unless you were preternaturally good at the thing. I do still find it pleasantly challenging.

	<body>Oh man!  I&#039;m venturing into my third exploration of the Magic Realm, this time with the Amazon and the White Knight.  Previously I had tried with only the Amazon, getting trapped by two heavy serpents, and unable to escape or harm them, she was defeated.

Wow, what a difference with two characters!  So far we&#039;ve killed a tremendous dragon, a goblin, a spider, and one of those damn snakes.  Amazon chick (gotta figure out a name!) lures them over, dodges their attacks (I was fortunate enough to find an elusive cloak in the dragon&#039;s lair), and Whitey smashes them with his greatsword.  So far, great combo.

I am so excited for everything this game brings.  I&#039;m still on session/act 2, and can&#039;t get enough.  Looking forward to spells, natives, events, etc.  And then on top of that, [user=richfam] has made the amazing Book of Quests for Magic Realm, further expanding the explorations.

One day I&#039;ll make an awesome pnp copy to give away, so that more can experience this solo awesomeness!</body>

	<body>[b][center][size=16]&#039;HISTORICAL FLAVORED&#039; MAQUIS - GIVE AWAY[/size][/b][/center]

As Lorenzo mentioned in the header, summer holidays came to their end and we are looking for Christmas time. To anticipate a bit, I thought my historical flavored Maquis copy could please someone. [i]Lorenzo, it&#039;s not related to your challenge, I&#039;ll do another post on that later on... [/i] 


Why does it have a special flavor?


I&#039;ve PnP Maquis at the beginning of July. 

[imageid=2589942large]

It didn&#039;t leave my day backpack since. It&#039;s been played every time I had the opportunity (i.e. often); especially ideal on a &#039;café&#039; terrace. 



During my summer vacation, I visited some, more or less famous, Maquis in France (Maquis du VERCORS - very intense fights and a lot of memorials there - Maquis in the MASSIF CENTRAL - less famous than the previous one. However, my grand-father fought in it; thus, I know it&#039;s genuine. LYON was a very active city during the resistance. Resistants used the romans&#039; secret paths - called the &#039;traboules&#039; - all over the city to avoid being spotted by the milice. Very efficient.). 


[imageid=2649295large]


My copy has been played in those locations; thus, a kind of &#039;historical flavor&#039;...


I know that some of you would like to play the game but are not into PnP&#039;s stuff. You also may have printed it already but, as an history&#039;s lover, would have some pleasure to play an &#039;authentic&#039; Maquis copy.

[i][center]------ disclaimer ------[/center]
It&#039;s not a fantastic PnP (I know that some of you do - almost - professional job) and it travelled quite a bit this summer :). But it&#039;s clean enough.
[center]----------------------------[/center][/i]

If you&#039;re interested, just put a comment below, related to France. 
I&#039;ll randomly pick a recipient in a week (next Tuesday evening, PARIS time) and will pay for shipping.


edit : Lorenzo,I mixed up your name and your pseudo and called you &#039;Luke&#039;. My mistake. Sorry.


[center][COLOR=#FF0000]----- [b]UPDATE : DRAWING LIST[/b] -----[/COLOR][/center]


[User=bichatse]Jack Staines [/user], Maquis’ designer, wrote a very nice story in the comments’ section. I’ll past the beginning, &#039;authenticating&#039; my copy even more! 
I invite you to read his French story as well. Thank you for the game, Jack :)

[q=”bichatse”] If it helps add some authenticity, by coincidence the Maquis du Limousin and the Maquis du Vercors were two of the primary inspirations while I was developing the game - it was largely reading accounts of those groups that determined what kind of missions would feature in the game. For example, I seem to recall that the Limousin group managed to effectively liberate quite a large area on their own before the Allied armies reached them - hence the Liberate mission![/q]



[b]Thank you all for the stories. I had a lot of pleasure to read them. I didn’t want to clutter the comments’ section. I answered in the list below.

In 2005 we had a gig with our band in a pub called Le Resto-Rock in 37600 Mouzay. We drove 800 km, 4 people in a car loaded with instruments and merchandise. We played in front of maybe 30 people :D, slept on the first floor of the pub and were not allowed to leave the room because the pub was guarded by 3 huge dogs (I think there were 3 but it could also been just 2) and they didn&#039;t like strangers. :zombie: And the best part was that once locked inside that room, there was no chance to go to the toilet anymore. :D

I am reading a book called D-Day, which covers the d-day landings and the subsequent fighting through France. About 3/4 of the way through. Very interesting read!! Can&#039;t imagine what everyone went through all those years ago! I like reading these books, so fascinating!

Being in a band and on the road leads to hundreds of great stories to tell. I don&#039;t want to miss those days. But I miss one of our band members though. Our drummer committed suicide years ago.

We summer vacation each year in Draguignan. An interesting historical site, because after the Normandy landings, Allied troops landed on the French south shores. They had agreed on a rallying point they would move towards.
Which was Draguignan.

The name of the operation? [b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dragoon]Operation Dragoon[/url][/b].

Long ago, I spent some months living in Paris, and was hoping to be able to move there permanently, but despite my best efforts, I couldn&#039;t get working/residency papers. :(  It&#039;s one of the few places in this world that  I felt at home.

CM that&#039;s strange there&#039;s an Irish word amadán (pro: ama-dorn) which means fool/idiot, teachers used to use it a lot in my day.

Back on topic, my last holiday to France was magnifque - one of my favourite family holidays of all time.  We drove over landing in Cherbourg (from Rosslare) and drove down to near Albi in the south.  Stopping off on the way to see Bayeux Tapestry, Le Mans (lovely and learned all about the Wright brothers!), Limoges (visited Oradour sur Glane), Lascaux, Cassuade and finally sampled some Galliac wine.  Whilst we were down there we even popped to see Norman Foster&#039;s bridge.  The route back up was along the coast and we visited Bordeaux and Saint Nazaire too.

I had read a great book about the Resistance so being in the areas around Oradour/Caussade/Tulle was quite immersive and doing some geocaching took us to a ruined château near Albi that had been used by the resistance as an HQ and was subsequently bombed.

Beautiful countryside, fascinating history, lovely food and quaffable wine - best holiday ever.

This is great, thanks!

I spent some time in high school as an exchange student in Lyon. I met some great friends on that trip, many of whom still stay in touch thanks to Facebook and such. I attended school there, went snow-shoeing in the French Alps and more. Such a fantastic experience.

Thats very generous of you, thank you Delphine!

I&#039;ve been wanting to go to france for a few years now, ever since I started bouldering (a form of rock climbing without ropes or a harness, you just use mats to prevent injurys from falling and its not about height, bouldering problems are usually only 3-5 meters high).

There&#039;s this apparently amazing place called [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau_rock_climbing]Fontainebleau[/url] near france. This is supposed to be bouldering paradise for everyone. For little kids to run and play around in, for serious athletes, for familys... There&#039;s problems ranging from &quot;climbing a ladder&quot; to &quot;impossible&quot;.
I wanted to go there every year the last 5 years. And every single time, I didn&#039;t make it.
Now its finally happening, we have the trip firmly planned for beginning of october. Can&#039;t wait to finally go there!

I think the game needs to take a trip to Norway.

I have never been to France, but spend 3 weeks every summer watching France on tv. Tour De France is a cool experience.

And I do want to cycle up Mont Ventoux.

What a cool thing to do!

If it helps add some authenticity, by coincidence the Maquis du Limousin and the Maquis du Vercors were two of the primary inspirations while I was developing the game - it was largely reading accounts of those groups that determined what kind of missions would feature in the game. For example, I seem to recall that the Limousin group managed to effectively liberate quite a large area on their own before the Allied armies reached them - hence the Liberate mission!

(If you had managed to take the game to Paris as well, you would have covered all the major inspirations - I don&#039;t recall her name off-hand, but the chemist Spare Room is largely the result of reading about a Parisian lady who spent the war making bombs for the resistance in a room above her pharmacy before being caught and executed by the occupiers.)




Despite living so close, I&#039;ve only been to France... three times, I think, myself. Twice to Paris - where I discovered dried apricots in a street market near the bank of the Seine - and once to Caen, in Normandie, as part of a school trip to see the various D-Day beaches, Pegasus bridge and the (supposed) first liberated house in France, and so on.

Unfortunately a rubbish French teacher when I was eleven put me off the language and I switched to German instead for my exams, and I&#039;ve always been very leery about travelling places and just assuming everyone speaks English - it&#039;s kind of arrogant and unfair! More recently - thanks to my Italian partner - I&#039;ve tried Italian instead. She wants to go on holiday to Bretagne or Normandie, though, so there&#039;s still a chance...! (Her mother was even a French-language teacher before she retired.)

(Obviously, I have my own copy already, don&#039;t enter me into the draw!)

Wow what a generous offer!  I&#039;d love to play this game.

I am both French and American.  I grew up in the Paris suburbs and lived in Provence for a bit before moving to the US.  My grandparents on my father&#039;s side of the family experienced WWII in France and North Africa so I heard resistance stories when I was a kid.

As you can see on my profile, I selected the name Provence as a made-up Resistance nom-de-guerre/name had I fought in WWII and chose the 2DB flag with the Croix de Lorraine as my avatar.

So yes, in short, I&#039;d love to play this game and have an &quot;authentic&quot; copy ;)

I didn&#039;t watch the tour this year.  It&#039;s the first time in about 10 years.  All the doping got to me and I just couldn&#039;t turn it on, this year.  Oh well.  Maybe I&#039;ll be in better spirits about it next year.  Thanks for nothing, Lance!

Don&#039;t read Tyler Hamilton&#039;s book, or do and read about the train wreck that is doping in cycling.  (it&#039;s actually a good read but still.)

That&#039;s a very generous offer, Delphine. I made a comment in last month&#039;s SGOYT about your copy of Marquis probably looking like a work of art. Now that I&#039;ve seen pictures I know that my faith in you wasn&#039;t misplaced! :) I&#039;d love to have such a beautiful looking copy.

I&#039;m extremely rubbish with PnP as I lack dexterity, I&#039;m left handed, and I don&#039;t have access to a colour printer. My copy of Marquis looks like an early prototype for an abandoned game!

But France....I&#039;ve been to Lyon and loved it. What a beautiful city! We spent a lot of time trying to uncover as many of the traboules as we could. We were there for a friends wedding near Saint-Étienne and wanted to spend a couple of nights exploring Lyon.

My partner did struggle a little bit as she&#039;s vegetarian and when we were there a while ago there didn&#039;t appear to be many veggie options. The funniest moment was when she ordered something that the menu described as a local delicacy and it turned out to be tripe! Fortunately I&#039;d ordered a salad so we were able to swap as I&#039;ll eat pretty much anything.

Traboules played a major role during the resistance (and all over Lyon&#039;s history. It&#039;s a major reason for the reputation of secrecy of this town during the middle age). 

For those who never heard about that : traboules are a kind of secret paths going from buildings to buildings, almost without going outside. It was possible to enter a building in a street and travel 4 or 5 streets away from the initial door&#039;s entrance without going outside (thus being almost invisible to people searching you). It&#039;s rather hard to clearly explain what a traboule is...

I don&#039;t know how much of the traboules you visited in Lyon, Paul. It depends on [i]when[/i] you visited them.
When I was a child, it was possible to travel from the big central square (place Bellecour) to the Hill of Fourviere (a walk more than a mile long) through traboules going outside only 3 or 4 times. 
Nowadays, most of them are closed for security or privacy purposes. I believe some of them remain, but you visit them with a guide-tour. Sad. I get pretty nostalgic with this evocation, that was so much fun to get lost into the traboules :)

We were there in 1999. I&#039;m not sure whether much has changed since then, but I&#039;m guessing it has. I can&#039;t remember for sure how many we found but there were certainly a few we found once we knew how to recognise them that weren&#039;t in our guide book. Most led through courtyards of otherwise private residences. They were all overground traboules as I believe even then all the underground ones were blocked off. We did do a walking tour of the city that took us through a couple that weren&#039;t otherwise usable.

It must have been an absolutely magical place to grow up with so many secrets awaiting discovery!

Paris is our next destination. Me and my girlfriend visited London last year and since we had two weeks to spend there, we were tempted to split half of the trip in France. We ended up staying full time in England to lower the cost of the trip but I was very sad that I could not visit Paris. 

My girlfriend already went for a couple of weeks a while ago. She barely remembers it because she was a lot younger. Now I really want to go and I maybe have a plan to propose to her. :P We&#039;ll see how it goes.

Since I&#039;m french Canadian, this will be a place where language won&#039;t be an issue. So that&#039;s something less to stress about !

Edit : By the way ! This game is amazing ! I play it all the time on my phone. :)

I had the pleasure of visiting Paris several times when I was stationed in Europe with the US Army back in the 1980s.  I just loved all of the history and artwork.  I could spend days in the art museums in the city.  I even had the privilege of being in Paris for the bicentennial, July 14, 1989.  It was such a special memory for me.

I&#039;m not keen on Paris, apart from the Cathedrals and museums. There are many nicer European cities IMHO, especially if you are into history.

Barcelona, Rome, Athens, Istanbul, Budapest, Prague, Florence, Siena, amongst others.

I would really like to see New England and Canada in the autumn. Landscapes are a much bigger turn on for me.

As a child my family used to holiday in France every year. I don&#039;t think there is a part of France we didn&#039;t visit. As an adult I&#039;ve started visiting France again with a different appreciation for some of the historical towns.

In June I visited the Loire and Dordogne regions and in December I will be in Montpellier for a couple of days and Bordeaux for a couple of days (I hope the trains are as good as I&#039;ve been led to believe).

Such a beautiful country and the roads are so quiet compared to back home.

I hope I can travel to France again one day.

Some years ago I was fortunate enough to take a trip there, and I did get to spend some time soaking up the culture, but I actually spent a large part of my time there on foreign soil (that is, non-French soil) as I was travelling with the child of diplomats stationed in there.

At one point they realised they weren&#039;t sure if I had permission to be in the parts of the Embassy I was so they told me just to smile at people politely and keep my mouth shut.  I felt pretty awkward but it all worked out fine.

Hey, you don&#039;t need my permission to disagree. My opinions only have any relevance to me. Everything we say comes with that implicit caveat.

Love Debbie Harry, hate that song. You are the one with questionable taste my friend :D

My musical tastes were informed by the sixties and seventies, when you could hear a record for the first time and know which band or artist had made it because they each had their own unique sound. The word &#039;band&#039; implied they could play their own instruments, it was okay to be ugly and the ability to dance was entirely optional.

Eminem should go back to working in a sweetie factory and JayZee (sp?) should find employment more suitable to his talents, perhaps a bingo caller? :D

And now I&#039;m going to shuffle off into the sunset with my pipe and slippers, muttering softly to myself as I go....

[q=&quot;Jude&quot;]Long ago, I spent some months living in Paris, and was hoping to be able to move there permanently, but despite my best efforts, I couldn&#039;t get working/residency papers. :(  It&#039;s one of the few places in this world that  I felt at home.[/q]

In 1971 I left school to train as a navigating officer in the merchant navy. For 5 years I travelled the world, seeing exotic places, many of which have now been developed out of all recognition. I just wish I had taken more time to truly experience and appreciate it. There is always tomorrow when you are young, until there isn&#039;t. Sieze the day, my friends.

On this day in 1971 I was in Reunion, a volcanic island in the Indian ocean, east of Madagascar :p

From there we sailed to Townsville, a small town in Queensland, Australia which has since become a major city I believe. The great barrier reef was truly awesome. We had the chance to go snorkelling, which was amazing. Our ship was moored alongside the quay in Townsville while we loaded lead and copper ingots and slabs and I happened to look over the stern, only to see a shark swimming around directly below me. I did not go snorkelling again.

Container ships were only just starting to appear at that time. I was on &#039;dry cargo&#039; ships where everything was lifted out or loaded on pallets. This was a much slower process, and if you were loading or unloading a whole cargo in a single port you could be there for a week in some cases, depending on the cargo. I later worked for BP tankers, where the turnaround time was typically 24-36 hours, not so good for sightseeing.

I was born in Townsville, one year earlier.

And yes, I have seen it grow from a small country town to a thriving city.
It is Australia&#039;s 13th biggest population center but as one of Australia&#039;s fastest growing cities, it is expected to overtake those immediately ahead of it.

We still export lead and copper but now we also have nickel, cobalt, zinc and sugar. 
And although we have shark nets in our popular bays, the most dangerous thing in our water is the Irukandji and other Box jellyfish.

I guess that is why we have so many public pools. :shake:

I never heard about it. For some unknown reason, it didn&#039;t work for me (no geographical warning, though)... Looks interesting. I guess, I&#039;ll have to find another way to watch it. Thanks Ibbo :)

	<body>[b]North Africa 1941[/b]

My tanks were on berskers mode from the start. I had Fortress Tobruk under control by the end of turn 3 but I&#039;ve lost one berserker panzer unit there. Anyway, things looked damn good.

[ImageID=2649371 large]
[ImageID=2649377 large]
[ImageID=2649373 large]

I found a good battle plan combination and used it almost every round. Ambush hit the table a few times and hit me hard every time! Most evil chit. ;)

A crazy thing happened. The map was almost empty at the end of one of my turns.

[ImageID=2649378 large]

The calm before the storm. Things changed from then on. The allies got tons and tons of reinforcements. Egypt was full of allied units rushing forward to make space for new reinforcements. 3 turns left before time was running out the Go! chit changed everything. The map was full of allies and there was no chance to win this anymore.

[ImageID=2649380 large]

Every time I reached egypt the allies pushed me back. I just can&#039;t get to those last objectives there.</body>

It&#039;s a tough little beast. There are 3 small maps / scenarios. France, North Africa and D-Day. I played 15 games and won only 1. But it&#039;s a very good game. The AI is hard and brutal but when you win it really feels like a victory. And it really feels like playing against the game not you vs. you. I like the system of chit pulling battle plans and orders. One of the best AIs I think. The component quality is high but I have the deluxe edition. Never seen the normal one. Not sure if it is what you&#039;re looking for but I would recommend it as an overall game. Maybe there are better ones out there for the Africa part but this is one of my favorite solitaire games. If you have the chance to get it - go for it!

I really enjoy this game too. It is not your standard wargame, but the AI is great, and the chit pull battle system is genius. Very tough to beat but always enjoyable to play.

	<body>Wait and boardgame? It happened so often in my gamer’s life… 

will [b]27 years[/b] (1986-2013) be a wait, long enough ?

I bought [gameid=2511] first edition when I was young. With the expansions, one after the other. 

The first expansion was “Meurtres à Carlton House” (I believe it’s [gameid=3224] in English) which contained 5 new cases, from what I recall (maybe 4).
As I took my time to play it [i] (I still do, I really like this game and savor it, very slowly from time to time)[/i], I had only played the first two cases when it got destroyed in a flood. 

:nostar: Out of Print :nostar:



One day, while googling, I read that a reprint (with expansion, if it was successful enough) was in preparation. 

Waited;

Three years ago, the base game reprint came out. Resisted to buy one [i] (just to contribute to the potential success… ;)) [/i] and…

Waited;

When Carlton house, finally came out, two years ago, I went to the same store where I bought the first expansion (it still does exist : &quot;Les Jeux Descartes&quot; in LYON), 27 years before and bought the reprint. I have played the entire expansion last year. 

Verdict : the wait was worth it :D

I&#039;m hoping the expansions get reprinted. I&#039;ve only played the first 3 cases so far (the first 2 solo and the third 2p collabotatively) and have enjoyed them greatly without being particularly successful.

True.

I definitely got that feeling from my one game. Solving the case felt like a win anyway and just having those aha moments was great.

Part of my Mount Rushmore of great games  - there&#039;s simply nothing else like it, before or since. Phil has it right - ditch the scoring and enjoy the ride, otherwise you&#039;ll miss some fun side quests.

Have had all the expacs for a long time, but just this year cracked open Mansion Murders. Totally worth it just for the case that is a pastiche of The Maltese Falcon.

	<body>The last 2 days of my [geekurl=/geeklist/195146/cant-find-name-my-incredible-19-days-work-kick-ass]19-days-off-work-kick-ass-SoloCon[/geekurl] and I had another game of [thing=146652][/thing]. Second movie this time and with the researcher. Not a lot of life points there.

Objective one was cool. I had some killer cards in my deck and one cool combo showed up during objective 2.

[ImageID=2649410 large]

Objective two was brutal and when I had only 2 life points left I scanned a room and discovered an even card..... :zombie:

[ImageID=2649411 large]

I played every movie now during the last 2 weeks and I think the first one is my favorite. Just like with the movies. ;) In the game they are all very good but the first one is my fave after all.

Can&#039;t wait for [thing=174570][/thing]. Even changed my avatar this morning. But the funniest thing is that there is a woodpecker in the woods around the house - I live next to a small forrest - and my friend is hammering those trees for a few hours now. It echoes through the area and sounds just like the noise the Predator makes. :D That is so cool.</body>

[b]Runner Deck:[/b] Kate McCaffrey
[b]Corp Deck:[/b] Jinteki


As the runner: Won 8-0
As the corp: Won 7-5

[b]Total Score: WON 15-5[/b]


I created 4 runner and 4 corp decks from scratch. Using base, first cycle and first deluxe expansion. The Jinteki deck isn&#039;t great and vulnerable as demonstrated on my turn as the runner. I got lucky though and stole an agenda every time i hit R&amp;D! 

I think i might look at the AI again and see if i can tweak it to become a bit more competitive. If anyone has ideas let me know!!

Jinteki never really came into their own until they got their own deluxe expansion, also their style of play - traps and bluffs are probably the hardest style to replicate with an AI. As you are always aware if there is a trap or an agenda in a remote and running it doesn&#039;t quite have the same thrill as face to face.
Having said that they are my favourite faction.

In my deck the ice cards are too easy to get through, i&#039;ll have another look at it. I made it work, just when i was the corp, still, if AI had 1 more coin, would of lost!!!

With ambush cards, i always treat them as active whenever i access them in R&amp;D or HQ and shuffle them back into the stack whenever they get into remote server! Should add a bit more difficulty!

As you are always aware if there is a trap or an agenda in a remote and running it doesn&#039;t quite have the same thrill as face to face.
Having said that they are my favourite faction.[/q]

In my deck the ice cards are too easy to get through, i&#039;ll have another look at it. I made it work, just when i was the corp, still, if AI had 1 more coin, would of lost!!!

With ambush cards, i always treat them as active whenever i access them in R&amp;D or HQ and shuffle them back into the stack whenever they get into remote server! Should add a bit more difficulty![/q]

Most Jinteki ice is easy to get through, they want you to cop a taxing on the ice and then run face first into a trap for the flatline.  There aren&#039;t many glacier Jinteki decks.

	<body>Played my third game of this solo. I was using the first three expansions: mammas &amp; pappas, advanced visitors, and properties. I got beat so soundly on my first two plays against automa that I played on the easiest difficulty, even though I was using 3 expansions.

Guess what? I... tied automa! I know, that still counts as a loss, but it was my best showing yet. The properties expansion really makes a difference.  I would have won if he hadn&#039;t blocked both the &quot;play a card&quot; and &quot;fill an order&quot; spots on the last turn.

So far, I&#039;m really enjoying this game. Automa is brutal, but brilliant. It&#039;s so simple to implement, and it does a good job of adding uncertainty to the game &amp; keeping each play different. It&#039;s not the same as a real player because you can often predict what a real person will do, and you alternate placing workers with another person. I&#039;m still impressed though.

As far as waiting goes, I just made my first trade offer on BGG this weekend and I gave it a 10 day window. Hoping to get At the Gates of Loyang for Agricola. We&#039;ll see. I haven&#039;t heard anything yet.</body>

This feels different to Loyang so it might be for you Kevin.  However, it also might not. When I look at your top nearly 100 then maybe this just isn&#039;t your thing.

That&#039;s good for me though. You making we want to buy euros as well would be too tough on my wallet. :D

This is the big difference for me from something like Loyang (which I love). Viticulture is super thematic. It does have some Euro crunchiness, but not to the extent of Loyang.

Thanks Gary! 

I just found the 1PG trading post today too. If this doesn&#039;t work out I&#039;ll probably try posting a few games there. This is where I spend the vast majority of my time on the Geek anyway! :D

My wife and I don&#039;t drink, but the first time we played this game, we left the kids with Grandma &amp; I got a bottle of sparkling grape juice and set out some cheese &amp; crackers.

It was a blast! Definitely a thematic Euro.

Hang in there. It&#039;s a bit of a bear, but an exceptionally fulfilling experience if you can grasp it all. Took me 6 hours over three days to get through the playthrough and grasp what was going on.

	<body>This arrived on Friday last week and I have spent the weekend learning the (well written and simple) rules. This is another masterpiece by DVG and sits proudly alongside [thing=123955]Thunderbolt Apache Leader[/thing] on my shelf. I have been really enjoying solitaire wargames of late, in particular [thing=67600]D-Day at Tarawa[/thing], TAL, [thing=132028]Awakening the Bear[/thing] (superb) and now this wonderful game. 

The decisions you make just make this such a good game to play at both the strategic level on the main map, and then again on the battle map. The rules are very well written, and the 9 mounted maps give such longevity. So far I matched Napoleon&#039;s efforts in the 1796 Italian campaign, and now find myself struggling against the Marmeluke in Egypt. So looking forward to getting better at this over the next weeks. 

Highly recommended, and for me one of the best solitaire board games you can buy (along with Mage Kinght &amp; TAL). So well designed!</body>

I agree that this game has been amazing in the three games of it I have played.

Took a punt after enjoying a video playthrough and really glad I did.

Just love all the decisions and how you see them affect you later either in battle or on the campaign map.

	<body>Still playing Mistfall but just wanted to share this Encounter Winning* combo. [i](see disclaimer below)[/i]

I had taken two enemies out already and carefuly managed my Focus to lure just the Fellstalker toward me.  Then whilst Ghardhak was on his own away from me I had managed to bring him down to 1 HP.

Dodging the Fellstalker&#039;s attack, Ghardhak then closed in and was no longer  open to my attacks whilst the Fellstalker lived.  So came this move:

[center][imageid=2649654medium][/center]

Using the Long Bow&#039;s regular action of dealing 2 damage then Lightning Arrows (all damage becomes magic, +1 damage [i]- 3 magic damage takes care of the Fellstalker -[/i] plus deal 2 magic damage to a different Enemy in the same area) which I then boosted (rightly or wrongly*) with Arcane Bow Mastery (+1 damage) doing 3 to Ghardhak so 1 gets through and finishes him off.



[floatright]*[size=7]I have a feeling this would not be allowed as I&#039;m unsure the splashover damage can be boosted but screw it![/size][/floatright]</body>

Well, it&#039;s still fairly new to me.  I&#039;m currently working my way through each character solo to get a handle on how they play.  There seems to be a fair amount to each characters deck which makes them feel and play a bit different.  Playing solo is hard but very do-able - I can see a real party (2 or more characters) being lots of fun with all the options available.  The card errata is a bit of a pain but hopefully will be fixed soon.  Otherwise I really enjoy it, I like the system of cards and combos and numerous actions plus the cards being your health makes for a tricky balancing act but there&#039;s also a real feeling of progression with attacks getting stronger as you add to your deck.

In my mind it does hold up to Mage Knight comparisons with the emphasis on combat.

I&#039;m look forward to playing this more and eventually then tackling the campaign system.

They can be but it&#039;s well thought out and a good design (errata aside) that it becomes like a second language and relatively simple to follow, barring edge cases which most games would have anyway.

	<body>Have had Silent Victory on my table and wrote a session report on it. 

Gonna do a copy/paste here for those not frequenting the games page.

[i](Read this in a hushed tone)[/i]
Let me tell you a story, a story about an American hero, a man that did his duty during WWII, but first, listen to this:

[i](Read this with a movie trailer voice)[/i]
You have already been sunk near the British Isles, depthcharged to oblivion in the Atlantic,  spotted by the aircrafts in the Med, you have failed to survive Gibraltar and you have ended up on the bottom of the Bay of Biscay in June&#039;43. You have even fallen overboard in the Caribbian. 

You have done it, you have failed in every possible way in The battle of the Atlantic, even if you managed to bag the Empress before the flooding forced you to scuttle your boat right into the hands of the Allies, gifting them the Enigma machine and ending your days in a prisoncell in Kent.

[i](Read this like you are approaching the cresendo)[/i]
It is now time to be the Allies. It is time to take the fight to the Pacific. It is time to go hunting [b]the American way![/b]

[i](This you can actually read normally)[/i]
[thing=154875][/thing] is about to set sail.

[i](Que, dramatic voice)[/i]
More subs, more torpedoes, more tubes, more equipment, more missions, more targets, just more, more of everything, even more DUDS! :devil: [i](Evil laughter here)[/i]

[i](And now a sad voice)[/i]
The only thing not here is The Bay of Biscay, but that is actually a thing to be thankful for, because we all hated that Bay.

[i](From now on you can read it like you want to. Even in the voice of your neighbour if you like) [/i]

Let&#039;s get on to the session report. 

[thing=154875][/thing] includes info on 8 famous American subcommanders and includes info on patrols, tonnage sunk, ships sunk and awards recieved. The historical start date is also included which means you will do the patrols during the period of the war the commander operated.

George W. Underwood commanded the Balao Class USS Spadefish from July &#039;44 and he did 3 patrols during the war. 

I stepped into his shoes to try and match his 75,386 tons sunk during those 3 patrols. 

Setup is similar to [thing=113873][/thing] with the exception that this game includes a fancy Patrol map where you can sail around in the actual location of the patrols. This idea I think originated from usercontent made for The Hunters. 

[imageid=2643836medium]
Setup and ready to leave Pearl Harbour to go to the Philippines. 
Yeah, all components for the game are printed on dirtcheap copypapers and is not representative of the final component quality. (Ipad will not be included in the game) The historical captain card are the tan squares in the top of the image.

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]Disclaimer:[/COLOR] I was a proofreader for the game and that is why I have access to the components.[/i]

75, 386 tons is a lot in 3 patrols, so I entered this with a &quot;How am I gonna do this?&quot; attitude.

Transit was peaceful, with not a single airplane or pesky escort in sight. 
Arriving at my first On station box at the North end of the Philippines I spotted a Large Freighter and an Escort alongside it. Take on the escort(which is possible in the game) or go for the sinking and risk the detection roll?
I stayed at Medium range and launched my MK 14 Steam torpedoes, and even if the wake they make gives the Escort an easier time during the day, I go for it. Remember, I&#039;m up against 75, 386 tons so better get cracking.

Hits, no duds and 5700 tons on the logsheet and we exceed test depth to successfully avoid detection. 
Furious calculations about 6 On station boxes, ca. 5000 tons each box should be about 30 00 tons each patrol. Better hit what I spot to catch Underwood, because this is a game of catch up in the early stages.

Box 2 and I spot a convoy during the day, and roll for my 3 ships. 500 tons!!!!! You gotta be kidding me, that is just a small barrel??? Well, there goes my 30000 tons a patrol. 
The two other ships comes up as a 7400 ton Auxillary ship and a large Passenger ship at 5600 tons. 

I ignore the 500 tonner and launches half my torps at each ship. (I like the fact that there are 6 tubes up front in the Balao class)
The Aux goes down with all 7400 tons with a direct hit, but the other one is just damaged.
Escorts spot us and we take some damage, but after fixing our torp doors we go in pursuit and sink it with the Deck gun. 

Two boxes, 3 ships, around 17000 tons. And more importantly, no Duds. 

Third box has 2 rolls and the first one comes up very empty. NO! 
I can&#039;t afford to go without spotting anything. 

Second roll and we are just east of central Philippines. A roll of :d6-1::d6-1:

[b]Capital Ship[/b] WOO HOO!
This game really is a rollercoaster ride.

Roll 20, roll 20, roll 20, NO! No Yamato will be encountered today, no juicy 62 300 tons will be sunk on this day.

We roll and Encounter Hiyo. A 27500 ton Carrier. A smallish capital ship, but a Carrier. Underwood was known as a Carrier killer and gets a to hit die modifier versus these ships. 

We line up our torps, fire and gives it 1 damage, miss, miss, miss, miss and on the 6th torp another damage. 4 left since Hiyo started at 6. We  avoid detection by exceeding test depth. 

Well, now comes the problem. Can we keep up with Hiyo? Capital ships ar no longer automatically followed when damaged. You roll a die and if you roll a 1 you can follow it. What, a 1 to follow? Yes, but you get a -1 on the die for every damage you have dealt it, so with 2 damage already, I will follow on a 3 or less. 

:d6-2: Success. 

Lining up 4 more torps, the first one hits and splits Hiyo in two and it goes down. We did it, 27500 more in the boook. So far a great start.

Take some damage ourself, but gets away after a few rounds of depth charges. 

Encounters a lone 3800 ton Passenger ship which we sink with the deck gun. 
Then we head home, some hull damage, some damaged systems, two torps left and some deck gun ammo, but with 50 000 tons sunk. A sensational start, if I must say so myself. 

[imageid=2648194 medium]
The boat after the first patrol. ( The photographer had a wee too much taste of the celebratory drinks to get a steady camera)

[i][Some observations after the first patrol.
1. The patrol map adds a lot to the experience and it gives you a sense of where you encounter your targets.
2. These boats have a lot more stuff than the Germans in The Hunters. 
3. There are a ton of targets, with lots of variation in both tonnage and type. 
4. Seeing the sub combat mat go to 7 is a scary moment. 
5. This historical scenario thing is awesome. I can already imagine the challenges in the 1 player guild and on the SGoYT.
6. Man there are a lot of Japanese ships with Maru in their name. Could this simply mean ship?][/i]

We spend 4 months in Refit and then head out to the East China Sea for the first of our two patrols there.
25,386 tons left to equal Underwood. 

Transit is again uneventful, first box gives us an easy unescorted small freighter of just 2800 ton. Every little ounce helps, right?

Second bo comes up empty, but luckily we spot a convoy on the first roll in the third box.
1 torp lightly damage a Freighter, 4 torps just barely damages a 10000 tonner Auxillary ship, and the last torp sinks a small 4100 ton freighter. 
Time to exceed test depth, hold on, no exceeding test peth in the China sea, it is too shallow. Ohh, no, imagine meeting a capital ship here...

We survive the depth charges unharmed and follow the Auxillary boat, but Auxillaries can&#039;t be fired upon by deck guns, so even if it ends up unescorted we have to use torps. Fire away from the Aft, and 10 000 tons goes down. 

16700 tons so far this patrol. Now, with only barely 9000 needed to better Underwood, FEAR strikes full flight. What If I&#039;m now sunk, this close to the goal???

We spot a 7300 ton tanker and takes it on, unescorted as she is. Deck guns miss, Aft torps barely damage it and the torps fired from the front missed so much they were probably a bigger threat to fishing boats near Chile, than the Tanker here in the China Sea. 
Roll for additional round of Combat. He who doesn&#039;t dare, are not spotted by escorts, right? 

Lady luck smiles at me and I get a second chance and this time the deck gun hits home. 
74 200 tons, 1,186 tons away from my target, one box left of this patrol. But we have all seen those patrols where all we see are the waves crashing against another wave, endless sea, endless sky and a vast ocean seemingly empty of ships. 
1, 186 tons to go.

Roll for encounter in the last &quot;On station&quot; box. :d6-3::d6-5:

Yes, two ships, but escorted. Hope the target is over 1,186 tons.

Rolling for targets brings up Small Freighter Kori Maru which packs 1 100 tons. You gotta be kidding me??? 
Second target, Large tanker of 10000 tons. Yes. Let&#039;s bring this home!

Completely ignoring the smaller ship, I launch at the tanker. Miss, miss, miss, DUD(my first one), miss(seriously?), and a 1 damage hit. At least I can follow, but no exceeding test depth in the China Sea.

Rolling, rolling, :d6-3:(next one go low!!!) rolling, rolling :d6-2:
Avoided detection, celebratory embarrasing dance, eye rolling from wife, sit down again, launch torps again since the Escort followed.

Booom!!!
84,200 tons. I have managed to beat Underwood. Yeah, more dancing, some serious eye rolling. Sit down. 

What now??? I&#039;ve bettered him after 2 patrols, why go for a third? 

Well, tonnage isn&#039;t all you can match. There are number of ships sunk, and I have so far sunk 10, but that means Underwood has 4 more than me. Next target, ships, lots of ships. 
Ohh, and there is the small matter of decorations. 
Underwood had 3 Navy Crosses for sinking at least 5 ships(or Capital ships) in a patrol.
So I need 5 ships to beat his number of ships sunk, but 5 ships will only match his 3 Navy Crosses, sinking 6 ships can give me more awards. 

[i][Some thoughts after 2 patrols]
1. I hit alot this time.
2. DUDS are on a 1 in this stage of the war, in the beginning of the war they are 1-4. I can only imagine the frustration. 
3. Even when matching the tonnage early on there is more stuff to match. Ships sunk and medals are also a thing to match. And the small matter of surviving, because Underwood did survive the war.][/i]

China sea again.
Transit uneventful. Are there even aircrafts in the Pacific? I do not miss Bay of Biscay in 43. 

Bag a 7600 tonner in the first box and the second box rolls :d6-6::d6-6:

Random event. Bad.

Crew Illness. - 1 to hit. (Insert colorful swearwords here)

Wife: &quot;Did you die now?&quot; 
Me: &quot;No, my crew fell ill.&quot;
Wife: &quot;Ok?&quot; 
Me: &quot;It gives a diemodifier to the To hit table and I am on the hunt for ships because I need to match Underwood&#039;s total....&quot; 
Wife: &quot;Underwood????&quot;
Me: &quot;George W. Underwood, American Sub commander born June 3rd 1910, sailed three patrols and sunk...&quot;
Wife: &quot;Yeah, yeah, go tell someone on boardgamegeek!&quot;
Me: &quot;14 ships...&quot; 

Crew illness is not gonna be good, but I still manage to sink both the 2300 ton Peking Maru(that name again) and a 900 tonner. Ships count now, so everyone is a target. 
Encounter a 10500 tonner and bag that to equal Underwood&#039;s total. 
[b]Take that, Crew Illness![/b]

Second to last box, do not come up empty. Do not dare come up enpty.


SHIP, unescorted. Woo hoo. Boom, Boom. 4400 tons to the bottom. 15 ships. Success. Can I get another one to try and get the Navy Unit Commendation. I will get it on a roll of 1-3 if I sink 6 ships this patrol. 

Last box and two ships turn up with an escort. A massive barrage with all torps is aimed at the 2900 ton Senyo Maru and he goes down in a blace to give me my 16th ship. 
I avoid detection and send a thank you to Lady Luck which have watched over me during dud rolls, detection rolls and even during Escort Attacks. 

I sail uneventful into Pearl Harbour and end my career at 16 ships sunk for a total of 111.900 tons. I&#039;m super satisfied with my performance even if I failed the NUC roll and had to make do with my third Battle Star for successful patrols. 

Me:        111.900 tons, 16 ships, 3 Navy Crosses
Underwood: 75, 386 tons, 14 ships, 3 Navy Crosses. 

I matched awards, and bettered both tonnage and ships sunk. 

Great fun and 7 more Captains to match. 

[i][Thoughts on the game after completing the Underwood scenario.
1. This historical match the captains stuff is brilliant. 
2. While the game (in the late part of the war) can&#039;t match the constant &quot;I&#039;m about to die&quot; feeling The Hunters had, the race for targets, tonnage and awards are cool. 
3. This game is an evolved The Hunters. More targets(720), more subtypes(9), more special missions, patrol maps(in the box) 8 historical captains. Just a lot of stuff. More equipment on the boats, notes on special things on the logsheet(when stuff like radars go into effect)
4. Just a cool experience and I have not tried the frustration of the early war DUD-appaloosa. 

So are there any concerns.
Not much, but I am more famliar with the Battle of the Atlantic than the Pacific subwar, so I more easily get involved in the Atlantic, than in the South China Sea. Therefore, I don&#039;t get the Das Boot feeling I had in The Hunters, but this is a minor thing. I know lots of people have waited for the chance to go out as Americans. 
I missed the Encounter playaid Lines made for The Hunters. That was brilliant and I hope someone makes one for Silent Victory. 
This game screams for an achievement table like videogames do and like the Assassin game from Games Workshop had.
Like this for the historical scenarios:
Survive as Underwood. 
Beat Underwood&#039;s tonnage.
Beat Underwood&#039;s ships sunk.

And like this for the general game:
Survive the war in all types of boats. (9 different)
Be awarded the Medal of Honor
Sink Yamato.[/i]

So, bottom line. I liked the game a lot and look forward to getting the game proper. 

Another hit for Gregory Smith and Consimpress. The game is on p500 with GMT and is expected to ship in November.</body>

Yes, this type of game is made for challenges. The 8 Captains are ready to play challenges with little work for the one that hosts it.

[q=&quot;suzyvitale&quot;]Great post!  Well done.

If you ask John Kranz, he might give you axcess to the game components before release and that way you can maybe have your &quot;custom&quot; patrol map ready for when the game releases. 

[q=&quot;joestin&quot;]I couldn&#039;t get into Hunters, but I&#039;m still excited for this one. Great post![/q]

Can I ask why you couldn&#039;t get into The Hunters? Was it playing as the Germans that was offputting? If that is the case this one will be better.

	<body>So I got this game last Christmas from my Secret Santa, and although I LOVE it, I have a hard time finding opponents.

Well, the new BattleCON Online Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/level99games/battlecon-online-the-fighting-card-game-now-online)  got me thinking about this game again a lot, and I decided to pull out the single player Dungeon crawler mode and give it a try.

It was a lot more fun than I expected!  I thought it would feel more tacked on, but there&#039;s a lot to it, with lots of special abilities and items you can buy or find, and lots to think about with the combat, and there&#039;s a lot of replayability here, with several dungeons, and almost 30 characters to try to get through the dungeons using.

So yeah, I&#039;m very impressed, looking forward to playing it more.  I&#039;m not sure why I [b]waited[/b] so long to try the solo mode out.  I highly recommend it.</body>

I&#039;m happy to see this on the list this month.  This was a game I wanted to love solo, but just couldn&#039;t.  It requires a massive amount of playing to understand the intricacies of each character and their abilities.  It&#039;s amazingly deep, but wouldn&#039;t have gotten the necessary plays in my collection so I sold it to someone who would give it more attention.

	<body>Hi folks.

After lunch I played twice against the bot, after watching Ricky ROyal&#039;s videos, to clarify a couple of thins I didn&#039;t quite grasp. Played at easy level, but got thoroughly thrashed both times:

Game 1: New Sparta (Bot) vs. Doomed World (me): 39 VPs vs. 22 (Ouch)
Game 2: Separatist Colony (Bot) vs. Old Earth (me): 40 VPs vs. 21 (double Ouch!)


I kept rolling phase IV turns for the Bot, so both plays ended on turn 7, with a lot of VPs for that #~€@&quot; robot.

But I enjoyed it.</body>

I still play on easy and still have yet to beat it. Though in my last game, I came much closer. 

Once you get more comfortable with the cards in the deck (or at least the powers) and know what you need, exploring 7 cards to keep 1 becomes extremely useful!

I&#039;ll keep trying, that&#039;s for sure!

By the way, I have a question regarding the tokens of this game. I noticed that the three tokens simulating the 6-cost developments that Ricky Royal used on the video all had 6 VPs valour on one side, and 9 on the other, for adjusting the difficulty of the game. 
Is this the standard? Because my copy only has 9VPs on both sides of those three tokens, so they must be faulty.

That&#039;s weird, are you sure?

Yup, 6VPs on one side (for easy/med game) and 9VPs on other (for hard game).

Yes, I just rechecked it. Both sides are the same on the three tokens, marking 9 VPs. Not a big problem, though, but...

Yep, those are wrong. I just checked my unpunched copy. 6/6 is on the opposite side.

You should contact the publisher.

I just did. Replacement counters are on their way. 

Strange things keep happening to me, &quot;unboxingwise&quot;. The first copy I bought of [thing=25727][/thing] had inside melting candies (!) put there by the publisher, that soiled everything. 
Then, I got [thing=67600][/thing] without map (quickly sent by Decision Games, but still). 
Third, my copy of [thing=11437][/thing] came without the rulebooks (!). The online retailer sent me a PDF archive with them, that I printed.
And now, these strange counters.

Any of you had troubles like these?

So far for me:

1 - missing one card in Legendary Encounters: Alien
2 - missing one wooden resource token in Fields of Arle
3 - one pirate ship was the wrong model in Merchants and Marauders

All three were rectified by the publisher, LE in about 3 weeks and the two Z-man games in less than a week from sending an email (Z-man has very quick response to these issues).

1. In a sealed game, it had a torn corner and tape taped inside the box, but not where the tear was. :what:

2. My Conflict of Heroes had Spanish counters.

3. Field Commander: Napoleon was missing 2 counters.

These things happen. All were rectified. The torn box, they gave me $10 back. I don&#039;t really mind the problems too much, as long as they fix them.

	<body>Waiting. Actually a very fitting theme this month. I&#039;m waiting for so many games I backed on kickstarter. When I first discovered kickstarter, I was a bit sceptical but I found a multi purpose tool there that made a great present for a friend of mine. So I backed it. But thats just how I got into it.
Then I discovered the games there. And I went a little crazy. And apparantly, all of the games are arriving this months. The one that took longest will be [thing=150484]Secrets of the lost tomb[/thing], but its shipping already. Hopefully [thing=176524]Hoplomachus[/thing] (Origins. And the lost Cities. And Rise of Rome) will arrive this months, as should [thing=124827]Space Cadets: Away Missions[/thing]...

Thankfully, I don&#039;t back that many games anymore, my wallet had some very serious words with me.

Anyway. The other game I backed back then was this one, Steampunk Rally. And it just arrived today. I had to open it right away and play a test game. First shock: The translucent dice and the metal cogs are missing. Apparently I got a normal retail copy instead of a kickstarter copy with the extras. But alls good, I did ask on kickstarter about it and 5 minutes later the creator had already answered me, saying he was sorry that this happened and that I will get another game, this time the kickstarter copy! Awesome!

Its a racing game. You can play one out of 16 famous inventors (I used Alexander Graham Bell and Albert Einstein) and build steampunk machines for this no-holds-barred race through the Swiss Alps.

The game is divided into different phases. The good thing is, every phase is played simultaneously! So even if you play it with 8 players, it shouldn&#039;t take that much longer than with 2.
First you draft cards which you use to build your machine or get dice or cogs. My machine after a few turns:

[imageid=2649942medium]

Then you vent the machines. The dice you placed there activate them once and then are ballast that you need to get rid off.

Then you actually race. Meaning you place the dice and activate parts of your machine.

You can loose parts, too, because you take damage from cards or terrain.

After the first player has crossed the finishing line, one more round is played. After that round, the winner&#039;s determined.

I only made it about halfway and already my machines had exploded once... Not the worst thing that can happen, you just have to start from scratch and fall back.

[imageid=2649945medium]

There&#039;s a bit of strategy involved on what to build, which dice to get, how many spaces you will move because the terrain might damage or destroy you... And I just love the steampunk theme!


:thumbsup: Great game!
:thumbsup: Rulebook has a lot of examples, after reading it once I didn&#039;t have an questions (so far. I think)

:thumbsdown: No solo rules (at the moment). But its a racing game with hardly any hidden information. Only some of the cards have text that affects the other players. I didn&#039;t mind playing two characters at once and it should be possible to simulate an opponent like in Lewis &amp; Clark.

I gave a closer look to your picture, but was enable to answer. Is there a front and a rear in your machine? [Confusing both could generate a premature explosion during the race ;)]

That was a highly experimental machine, built from scratch in just a few moments, meant to put that young upstart Albert Einstein in his place!

The last one did indeed explode, so you might have a point there, hm. Maybe thats why I lost...

In the upper right corner you can see the &quot;main&quot; part of the machine with the picture of Alexander Graham Bell on it. Thats the one part of the machine you can never loose. For everything else, theres these half circles on the cards. They have to connect to at least one other half circle to complete it or you can&#039;t put a new card there.
But you only need to complete one of these circles for it to be allowed. The upper left card is not connected (no half circle on it) to the one below it, but that one is correctly connected to the one to its right. So its allowed :)

So to answer your question: The front part is the one on the right. I don&#039;t have a proper rear machine part in this picture yet, those are all more or less connecting tiles. I still needed a thruster, yes. But it works even with only one tile, you just won&#039;t go very far.

Thanks for the detailed explanation; It makes sense. 
Nevertheless, not sure I will be confident enough to drive (ride?) such a machine. Not that adventurous :)

	<body>THE friggen&#039; Monolith...

The Wait... an introduction:

Once upon a time, we lived in Philadelphia, PA. I found a great gaming group. We met weekly. Then we started to break out heavier games on the weekend days and dive in head first, while still doing light to medium weight on the weekly Wednesdays. We played High Frontier twice, and the winds of fate called us back home to Ohio. 

Before we left, my friend, [user=tatertot18][/user]  &lt;-- this dude here, was going on a business trip to Canada (the Great North). He mentioned a boutique game shop... one that held new copies of rare euro games, La Valet ďcoeur. He said that they may have Antiquity... Google-fu told me they did!

So I slapped a 100 marked greenback into his hand... and I waited.
It was March. I&#039;d see him in June, at Origins (being Columbus meant it was in my back yard).

It was March, and we packed it all up, and moved in April, and then set it all up again. Shortly sheet the move, I got a picture of the game in shrink! Eeee! It&#039;s gonna happen! Oh wait, the box is too large to fit in my buddy&#039;s carry on! Oh no! Luckily, a coworker is sympathetic to the cause and muled it back to the US for him, for me... and then May came...

... and every day of May, I thought about Antiquity. And then June came. Finally! 
So, it&#039;s Wednesday morning, I&#039;m checking in at registration, getting my Badge. 
I get a text. &quot;I&#039;m here... good news / bad news&quot; and no responses to my reply of &quot;?????!!!??&quot;

I walk across the way, ready to get some gaming on. 
I prepare for dire news.
Apparently, the bus had a leak of water somewhere in the luggage stow. 
He hands me his stack of Star Realms cards, warped, and wet. 
He tells me that his Armada fleets were spared. 
But... Antiquity only fit on the bottom of the suitcase. The foundation sized brick it is...
And the water that destroyed other games... somehow, didn&#039;t (!?!) Kill Antiquity!?!?
He jokes, it must have been the shrink wrap. Well, it must have been. 
The game is bone dry. The box is as pristine as if just off the shelf. 
My eyes melted add I looked upon the brilliance, fellow apes around me shrieked in glory, awe and fear...

We talked about it in February, bid Farwell in March, acquired in April, waited in May, played in June. After traveling from Canada to Philly to my home in CBUS, the eagle had finally landed. 
[The first time I played, we both lost... although I held on for another 4 turns before being strangled under the weight of my own graveyard laden cities].

That was the wait. 

Now, my son is bouncing off of the walls, ready to go to the Park. 

So I guess you&#039;ll have to wait for me too get back and type up my solo play report on this beast of a game. I think I played around 3 hours before I finally crushed the invaders. 



--more later, including pics and the report! :D ;)

Never heard of Zimbabwe (the game that is). Is it about assassinating an evil tyrant?

Comments like this make me feel slightly better about not being able to justify the prices of Antiquity on the geek market. Love Zimbabwe... And it&#039;s the reason I preordered their new game blind (even if the title is a bit pump).

	<body>I have played first mission of Guadalcanal campaign: Tenaru.
I played for USA side. Japan forces are trying to cross Tenaru river and americans should hold them while managing to get 6 flags.
Disclaimer: I play this game using heavily modified homerules: I have added ZOC&#039;s, defensive fire, combined attacks, figures have hitpoints and supression points and using big &quot;Breakthrough&quot; deck from Winter Wars.
With all these rules this game looks more similar to PC game Panzer General II and I liked it better than the original set of rules.
Now to AAR:
Japans started with attempt to destroy 2 artillery units on the left USA flank, they managed to destroy 1 art. unit:
[ImageID=2649984]
I counterattacked using shermans from reserve and restore the defensive line, unfortunately losing shermans in the process. (I really should not send shermans into close combat!)
To get enough flags I sent troops from the right flank in attack across the river. In the center USA was too weak to move:
[ImageID=2649985] 
Japans hitted hard in the center and destroyed almost all USA units here.
To save the day I pushed on both flanks and used survived artillery to finish retreating weak Japans units.
Final count: 6-5. Very close USA victory:

I have campaign book vol 1 but didn&#039;t buy the second one because I don&#039;t play single board scenarios any more. I really wish they would produce more battle maps and a campaign book devoted to that format.

So what do you think of the campaign book? This is for both Phil and OP. I have volume 2 available to me. This is quickly become a favorite of mine. I play it as often as I can. I haven&#039;t ventured into over load or big maps. Happy with the little one. I bought the winter/sand board and the eastern front expansion. I&#039;ll be buying winter wars and Pacific theater next.

I own both campaign books. I just started to play it, but I like campaign rules very much, especially randomized campaign conditions and that results of previous battle may influence on the starting conditions of the next battle. I would recommend you to get Winter Wars because it gives you Breakthrough Deck, which allows more flexibilty in troops command. (All sections card allow you to give &quot;movement&quot; orders to any 1 to 3 units in any section of the map, they can&#039;t fight but they dont stand still all game through like it happens sometimes when you use basic deck. And you need Pacific if you want to play &quot;Island Hoppers&quot; and &quot;Bicycle Blitzkrig&quot; campaigns.

M44 is my most played game, over 400 plays. The first 100 or so were single board games. Then I bought another base set, painted all the minis, got the battle maps and moved on to Overlord format. The rule set, scenarios and overall experience are so much better that I have no desire to go back to single board scenarios ever again.

HOWEVER, I would say that if you like single board scenarios, the campaign books are a must-buy as they spice that format a lot.

My first instinct is to say I can&#039;t imagine playing a single game 400 times but then I realize I think I got a 300 play achievement or something for Ticket to Ride.  That was on my phone in transit during my commute though, it didn&#039;t require finding time and space to sit down and play!

Glad you found a game you enjoy so much.

As I mentioned last month, I have over 1,000 plays of Can&#039;t Stop logged on yucata.de

The name of that game is quite apt, especially as I would never dream of buying it :)

I can&#039;t imagine ever getting bored of M44 Overlord format. I have painted the minis for quite a few games that I own, but this game is probably the only one that the time and effort has been worthwhile.

I would say that 90% of the nearly 300 games in my collection have been played between zero and two times. My bad.

Whoa, checking my records I haven&#039;t played this in slightly over a year.

Lost and rebuilt Tobruk a couple times, had Malta at [4] and the fort was keeping the usual suspects at bay (well, keeping the Italians and Luftwaffe on their &#039;1&#039; spaces), but then I had a Herkules check which I passed, but the fort was reduced and the very next card I had 2 fronts on the fort, Military at 0 and Morale at 0 as well so only 1 attack and that was at -1 DRM.  Kicked out Luftwaffe but Italians were still there and this time I lost the Herkules check only 4 cards into the Late war deck.

Brought this away on holiday to Corfu, hoping to get a game while I was actually in the Mediterranean, but sadly haven&#039;t got round to it. I&#039;m overdue a play of this fantastic game. Every playthrough I see has me itching to get it to the table.

	<body>Lovely new game!

Took the Baroness, along with the Gentleman&#039;s Gentleman (unflappable), a bodyguard, a clergyman, hunter, rigger (cursed) and writer (tossed overboard fairly quickly, actually), on their maiden voyage. Set sail from Port City and immediately encountered a Mirror Dimension; survived that only to shortly end up... um... &quot;Nowhere&quot;. Great success! Surprisingly, I made it to Atlantis, then cheesed it as my boys were too knackered to fight the second encounter. 

Suffered the peril of cramped quarters (hey, all those months at sea...) and some unbelievable phantoms, among other things. Encounters included a Horde of Rats, the beautiful Great Shard Reef, Dreams of Discovery... and the Door of the Living Sacrifice (hence the writer getting kicked overboard).

[imageid=2650070large]

[imageid=2650072large]

It&#039;s a game of two halves: exploration and &quot;resting&quot; which is where you build your crew and resources. In the solo game, you build a market of four possible crewmen and four resources. You can buy s total of four of these things, each round, the rest being discarded. The solo or co-op versions of the game aren&#039;t markedly different from the competitive version - something to be commended. It&#039;s actually fairly simple to learn, although the building up of your resources are what give it its bite, for me. In a four-player game I can see it dragging on, as you&#039;re looking to use your base resources, the deck of cards you&#039;re building, plus any resources or bonuses added by crew you own. Nicely, any crew you buy, you can then use them that same round. So you&#039;re building up some combos to maximise what you can get. 

Initially, I couldn&#039;t see how to afford anything, or survive anything (shades of the tactical play of Shadowrun: Crossfireto be slightly controversial) but it soon swung into view. 

Enjoyed it, a lot, and very happy to have it in the collection. More on this one soon. </body>

	<body>I&#039;m setting a goal to play through each movie 3 times before packing it back up.  I already played the first movie twice in the last few days.  Just finished game 3 playing the priest and the gunner.  It wasn&#039;t much of a challenge.  At the end of the first objective I was able to get the &quot;Last Survivor of the Nostromo&quot; card.  My next hand I got &quot;It&#039;s a Damn Robot!&quot;.  Two very strong cards that I normally wouldn&#039;t be able to get until towards the end of objective 2 at the earliest.
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1grQY6KaIEOy8oYv0UdPjWpFHVI26-brNxxdyNowJts=s400[/IMG]
I was consistently hitting card combos as well which allowed me to do extra damage or heal.  I drew 4 strike cards all game.  And all four of those came from event cards during the first objective.  It&#039;s fun having those dominating games.  As long as they are far and few between.
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bhAY7bpaV1_Vm9DiDvHqmMgTcLFIJYWgCgvuajh9E8g=s400[/IMG]

:star: You do NOT need to be a fan of the Aliens franchise to like this game.  I rewatched the first two movies and watched for the first time the later two train wrecks due to my love for this game.</body>

	<body>Haven&#039;t played this for a while, so I thought I&#039;d pit my wits against the Training Dummy.

As per rules, I picked two character sheets at random, and chose one to play. I picked Diplomat and Efficiency Expert, and I chose the latter.

Destroyed the hapless Dummy 35 points to 16. Poor thing did not stand a chance as an early purchase of an additional warehouse, coupled with my characters ability, meant I was generating resources much faster than the Dummy, thus beating it to purchases.</body>

I had a heck of a time winning solo player, so I went to using two players. That helped but I had still not recorded a victory after a few more games.

	<body>I started the day with no intentions of playing a game.  It WAS going to be a very busy and productive work day.  However, I encountered a problem with my accounting software and needed tech support. So I put in a call. 

[imageid=2650139]

This gave me plenty of time to read the directions to &quot;Through the Ages&quot; which I&#039;ve had set out on my dining room table for a few days.  I rented it on Friday night thinking I&#039;d give it a go to see if I was interested in buying it.  I made it through the &quot;set up&quot; phase, grew weary, and set up a tray of micro-greens instead. 

[imageid=2650146]

Being on hold for half of the afternoon gave me a chance to play a few rounds.  

[imageid=2650144]

I&#039;m quite confident that I&#039;m misunderstanding nearly every step involved in this process.  But I&#039;m committed to getting through the simple start game before I need to return it to the game library. 

*Update* I believe I&#039;ve finished the simple game.  However, I have no idea if that is what happened or not.  After working through this, the only thing that makes me want to try this game again are its accolades.  It&#039;s quite possible that this is the worst instruction manual I have ever tried to read.  I don&#039;t mind spending my energy figuring out the best strategy in a game.  But it is highly irritating to me to figure out what the game play actually is. My cussing to appropriate word ratio is very high right now. </body>

I LOVE this game. It&#039;s Vlaada&#039;s other masterpiece and the only non-wargame that I enjoy as much as his Mage Knight.

It has a steep learning curve and it is possible to get your civ engine out of balance and into a rut from which you cannot recover.

My only complaint with the components is those darned tiny cubes.

There is a good vassal module for this game and I also highly recommend boardgamingonline for a very good asynchronous engine.

I have played this game more than any other game I own, around 180 times alone in the past 2 years.  This is mostly because it is my husband&#039;s favorite game and we continually have a game going on Board Game Arena.  Seriously, I have never not been playing this game since we joined BGA a year ago.  It&#039;s a blessing and a curse....

Anyways, BGA is a great way to learn this game because the platform won&#039;t allow you to make an incorrect move.  If you&#039;re lucky, you can find an opponent who doesn&#039;t mind playing with a newbie.  Start with the simple game and work your way up.  If you&#039;re interested, please feel free to PM me and I&#039;ll happily play a game or two with you (because I clearly don&#039;t play this game enough already, lol).  My username is Suzykewsy.

If you like complex civ-builders, DO NOT give up on this one.  I too went through the motions of reading the rulebook, and the rewrite, and watching videos.  But until I played it on BGO with a friend where we could work together figuring out the rules, I didn&#039;t grasp it.  It&#039;s now one of my favorites, both solo and mutli-player.  

BTW, people are mentioning Board Game Arena, but I&#039;ve been playing it on BGO: http://www.boardgaming-online.com/

I played my first game yesterday, a 2 player game with someone who knew it pretty well.  The turn order is pretty long so you have to remember quite a few steps but... I wouldn&#039;t say it is a super complicated game, especially if you have a guide.

I wouldn&#039;t start with a full game.  We played the advanced game, which only goes until the end of the second age.  2 player, with setup, teardown, and teaching, was probably 3.5 hours.

Once you get the rules down there is a lot more to the game beyond that, but starting out wasn&#039;t as bad as I feared.

Honestly, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever played a civ-building game, simple or complex. We&#039;ll see how this one goes.  I&#039;m definitely committed to learning it.  [/q]

This game will be too long for some, too complex for others and don&#039;t ever think of playing it with more than 3 players F2F, even 3 is a stretch F2F, but a great experience IMHO.

But if you like this game you will almost certainly love it. The ultimate civ game IMHO.

Tough to learn from the rulebook, not so much if you are taught, and harder still to play well, but so rewarding.

Probably the most unforgiving game I&#039;ve played as you can drive your nation into a dead end, but once you get the hang of it it becomes intuitive.

Enjoy !

I have [user=suzyvitale][/user] teaching me across three time zones. She seems to have the answers to questions I could NOT figure out by reading the rule book. I think this will help quite a bit.  

I love to be challenged, but not irritated.

Walk me through a game on Boardgaming-online.com. He trounced me, but helped me understand subtle stuff all throughout the game. Wouldn&#039;t surprise me if he&#039;d be willing to help anyone here.

	<body>Up early this morning, decided to get this out for my september challenge over on the 1PG.


Typically the cards that came out, the AI could&#039;t use so kept gaining 1 of each good almost every turn and picked up the most expensive cards. I was playing catch up and was the first to get the 4th card, but the AI could also pick up its 4th card!! I knew this would be close count:

[b]AI:[/b] 33    
[b]Me:[/b] 32


:soblue: 


After two games i&#039;m 1-1 with the AI!! Right gloves are off :angry:


On a side note, i quite enjoy this game, quick and the AI can sometimes be tough to beat!</body>

My card sleeves turned up today so I was finally able to get this on the table.

Wow.  What an amazing game!

Setup and play is incredibly easy to pick up thanks to the excellent rulebook.

The game is difficult, but enjoyably so.  I managed to save a number of slaves, but in the end was defeated with one slave market card left to go.

Already counting down the time until I can play this again! :)

the game is simple to pick up, however winning is a challenge !! Just when you think you have it sorted, the AI throws a spanner in the works.

Make sure you read the background info in the instructions, brings a whole extra level to the game then.

FYI - I have had no issue with the components at all.

A few of my cards are damaged - they seem to either have been water damaged or been stuck together and then separated.  However, it&#039;s only a few cards and none of them are unreadable.  Apart from that issue, I&#039;m really impressed with the components :)

After a game of Malta, I naturally had to pull out its stablemate.  Although the battles are better in Malta, I think I prefer Emperor more.  In Malta, you are 100% of the defensive the entire game.  The Early War deck in Emperor is glorious, as the player smashes through one front after another.  Pretty much your only chance at victory in Emperor is to knock out 3 fronts.

Unfortunately, I had bad die rolls, and never really got any front too close to knock out.  The Solomons Islands fortification held up Nimitz until the last card of the game.  I was doing OK, even had Oil maxed out after the initial Sub card came into play.  

But in the Late Deck your resources melt away like snow in Death Valley and this game was no different.  Not to mention that a very nasty card, &#039;B-29 Fire Raids&#039; get reshuffled back into the deck, meaning you can be bombed again and again.  For maximum pain, I was also playing with the expansion deck.

With 10 cards left in Late War, the Brits and Chinese got to Japan Home Islands, but in the Resources Phase every single track went to 0 and that was the end of the game.</body>

	<body>So this sits on my wee little table in our bedroom:

[ImageID=2650186large]

I&#039;ve read the rulebook and have an idea of what to do having played other Rosenbergs, but I sit down and just look at it and say &quot;now what&#039;s that one do?, oh right, how do I get one of those? with this one...ok, hmmmmm&quot;

I do enjoy all the choices and I&#039;m sure once I have several games under my belt it will start to roll more quickly and smoothly. However, it&#039;s kind of daunting right now and I suspect that it will be on that table ALL month! So we (you all and I) will have to [b]WAIT[/b] an unusual amount of time (for me) to finish a game!

Edit 9/8/15:
So I actually sat down and played this all in one session! It was fun, and I think it will go faster as I get a better handle on what everything does. 

I think the &quot;randomness&quot; in this is me and my inability to focus on one strategy the entire time. I get distracted by &quot;ooh that sounds good.&quot; It might be good, but not best for the strategy. We&#039;ll see, it&#039;s one play after all and I&#039;m still learning. 

Here&#039;s the final board with a score of 71.5, which I feel is pretty good on the first outing:

Fields of Arle is essentially &quot;High Score: The Game&quot;. There&#039;s a LOT of options here, and it&#039;s learning how to maximize your choices that will be the challenge. I enjoyed it, so I hope you do too!

Agreed on the great game vibe for this. Unlike Agricola, there is very little stress involved in feeding your family. It makes for a nice leisurely pace that suits the super-wide design space of this game. There are so many choices available it is a pleasure (to me) to take my time and wander through a game, exploring options as I go. Love it.

And have no fear, just like most Uwe games, by the end of your first or second playthrough all the symbology should make total sense. Enjoy!

How far away is the table from your side of the bed?  Will you wake up in the middle of the night, get a drink of water, and make a move or two?  Or maybe you&#039;ll make your moves first thing upon waking up. :D

Dave,
It is a nice slow pace game. You can play a single turn (spring/fall I think?) and then step away for a bit. If I am not mistaken you only have 4 workers to place, its just figuring out what you want those 4 to do.

Suzy,

Never played Agricola but [thing=35677][/thing] is the same way. Gotta feed the masses! So FoA is a relaxing experience.

I always look at the picture section of a BGG game page before deciding on purchasing a game.  There have been quite a few that didn&#039;t make the cut due to cat incompatibility.  Some games are iffy but you do your best to make them work.  Some games you just can&#039;t play at home.  You can&#039;t miss out on *all* the games that are big or fiddly though!

One problem with longer games: bathroom breaks.  As soon as you close the bathroom door you&#039;ll hear a whack and a bunch of bouncing sounds.  Then you have to track down a die *somewhere* in your living room when you get back.

	<body>Alright, so it&#039;s my turn to take on the evil Aliens. I started out as the Scout against the 1st movie. Things went pretty well, as I was able to get &quot;Last Survivor of the Nostromo&quot; and &quot;Consult the Star Charts&quot; before the end of the first objective. That, and &quot;Mu-th-ur&#039;s Advice&quot; really boosted me through the game. &quot;Teams of Three&quot; and &quot;You Have Your Orders&quot; are really powerful together. This allowed me to pull a ton of good cards into my deck and to take down that &quot;Perfect Organism&quot;.
[imageid=2650187 large]
Only pulled 3 strikes the whole game, and one went away because of &quot;Jonesy&quot;. I&#039;ll say that this is slightly favorable to Predator in a few ways. All of Predator&#039;s Role cards only trigger with Brothers in Arms abilities (each card Coordinated to you on your turn), so playing solo means they&#039;re only good for their Attack values. The second Predator movie has an objective where you have to discard the top card of everyone&#039;s draw pile, and only completes if there&#039;s as much Attack as there is money, else you draw a strike. It&#039;s almost impossible solo, but I still have three movies here so we&#039;ll see if I run into any single-player snags.</body>

While I enjoy LE: Alien solo with one avatar, my preference is definitely to play solo with two characters as it opens up the coordinate possibilities and increases the difficulty some.

By &quot;it&quot;, I meant the second Predator movie. I know one of Lambert&#039;s cards has both an Attack and money of 2 each, so it&#039;s not impossible. Just hard to coordinate (plus with events keeping the objective from happening.)

[floatleft][ImageID=2647905][/floatleft]Got in a play of my favorite PnP game. Love the mix of theme and intricate gameplay in this one. Top notch, IMO. It uses dice in a unique way as a resource, but other resource options are available as well. You&#039;ve got to build up your movie empire to become one of the top studio heads in the business.

[floatright][ImageID=2647908][/floatright]I started out by greenlighting a low budget Historical film. I wanted to get some resources built up so I could lure some higher profile writers, directors and other industry big shots to my studio. I put my only star actor in the film hoping to improve my returns.

Meanwhile, I negotiated to get some extra help on board: a writer who knew some other folks looking to make and Adventure flick and some crew to help reduce production time. I got that one into the production schedule just behind the Historical pic, which released to a solid box office return and some future earnings.

Next on the docket was a mainstream Romance with the help of another writer with a sought-after script. My timing seemed to be good too, as the popularity of the genre was beginning to skyrocket. I just hoped the fickle public would hang on until its release.[clear]

[center][ImageID=2647910medium][/center]

Both the Adventure and Romance films did well, allowing me to start schmoozing some of the big name directors and actors to my side of the fence. However, their specialties were not in the public&#039;s eye, so I had to wait it out a bit.

[floatleft][ImageID=2647911][/floatleft]I needed to start looking for bigger payouts if I was going to hang with the big boys, so I set up a cross-genre Historical Adventure film. Unfortunately, I had to cut the budget down from my initial desire for it to be a huge, epic, cinematic extravaganza down to a mid-level mainstream movie.

[floatright][ImageID=2647906][/floatright]It paid out well upon release and gave me several months of incoming revenue, but the critics didn&#039;t quite go for it. My Fame was not increasing as I had hoped. And by now, the major movie season was winding down. The public&#039;s interest was beginning to wane.

I quickly threw a Musical together and got it out into the theaters, but it only received middling interest from moviegoers.

In the end, my Fame was only subpar. Without one or two big epics to my name, my time as a movie studio head would soon be forgotten. </body>

Thanks, Gary.  It&#039;s got a lot of moving parts, but I think it all comes together in a nice, thematic way.  The rules could use a rewrite, but I did create a player aid in the files section, which hopefully helps some.  

There is also a Vassal mod available on the game&#039;s main page, if anyone wants to try the game but doesn&#039;t want to go through the effort of printing it out.

Sorry guys!  I hadn&#039;t checked it before mentioning it.  Chad made two versions.  That one is the original...or was.  This should be the newer one:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0WBVnUE4NbHckt1d0VYR1pYWUE/edit?pli=1

Let me know it it works.  If so, I&#039;ll ask Andrew to update the game&#039;s page with the correct link. 

And if it doesn&#039;t work, I can post a copy with Chad&#039;s and Andrew&#039;s permission. 

We&#039;ll get it straightened out.  :)

	<body>This continues to be a fun little game and now with my little organizer it sets up quickly! It plays rather quickly too and there are certainly some decisions to be made. Not like Fields of Arle though! I needed something nicer before bed. Though I get the feeling that FoA will be the &quot;leave it set up game&quot; and move some pieces from time to time and come back to it. I kind of like that, and wish I had more space.
[-]
Anyhow, I did very well. I scored 32 points! Here&#039;s the picture, and someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong:[/-]

[ImageID=2650362]
[-]
I did all my turns just the same way I did them when I scored 5 and 10 points last month.[/-]

Edit: I was playing wrong above! Big surprise!
So, playing with the right rules and the only thing I think I did wrong was place the very first tile incorrectly. I replaced it for the picture so it looked nice, but the terrain didn&#039;t originally match up (we&#039;re just going to say it did) ;) 

[ImageID=2651669large]

I had a great draw of leftmost tiles and was able to zip over the Passage well before it froze over. I then worked my way back and used the sled to discover a few things and pick up a high point cairn. Then I picked up my sledders and kept sailing around until I had to bug out!

That is a tremendous score, I also sent you a GM, but were you paying &quot;worker actions&quot; to pick up the cairns, straits etc.? They cost either one or three actions to pick up, can really slow you down. I am surprised that you scored this high because I am still lucky if I get 5 or 6 points above zero.

OK, I need a consult on my second game. I was largely trying to draw and place the left most tile due to the solo variant&#039;s special ability. As you can see I only picked up 2 cairns and one eskimo. However, they were 14 points! I also got to the Passage in time for the 10 pointer thanks to good tiles and the special ability. As winter came down my team split up and that&#039;s when I got the 6 point cairn and then the eskimo (that with the ship as it thawed). The sled explored more and then got picked up as it thawed and was stuck. I used all the crewmembers now on the ship and explored the Southeast corner and then headed north for home and to lay a few more tiles where able. 

When I couldn&#039;t draw the left most tile, I committed one work for the tile, one for the placement of the tile and one for moving my ship there.

So I have 31 undiscovered tiles. 14 points from the 2 cairns and eskimo. Am I right saying I discovered 6 islands? I think the rulebook says it&#039;s ok if the map edge is a border. That means 6 points for a &quot;set&quot; of 5+ discovery tokens of one kind (you still get that in the solo). So that&#039;s 20 points. 
The islands themselves are worth 4+4+3+1+1+1 correct? That&#039;s 14. +10 for getting to the Passage by the fourth turn. So I&#039;m up to 38 points? -31 would be 7. 
Did I miss anything?



Are the straits and Franklin wreckage worth it?

You almost have it! The islands are correct (edge of the board does count). The &quot;set&quot; score is incorrect, it is not 6 points for 5 discovery tokens of one kind, it is 6 points for each complete set of 5 different discovery tokens (i.e. 1 cartography, 1 strait, 1 Franklin, 1 Inuit and 1 cairn). That is what makes the strait and Franklin tokens worth picking up.

So your final score would be 14 for islands, 10 for the passage, 14 for picking up the 2 cairns and one Inuit. That is 38 minus the 31 for missing tiles equals 7. You forgot to add the 6 points that you weren&#039;t allowed when doing your math anyway!

Thanks Rev! I have it now, and that makes way more sense. I was wondering why on earth I would do the low yield/high cost strait and Franklin wreckage discoveries. Now I need to try again!

I&#039;m currently in the middle of a 4-player PBeM game via VASSAL and I really like the system so far. The rulebook isn&#039;t particularly well written but the playbook helped clarify some of the stick points. One of the PBeM players also gave me a private tutorial via skype which worked out really well.

Are you playing with the solo AI&#039;s or playing each side yourself?

Yes, the wording of the bot priorities are at times extremely condensed and some bot actions just simply are quite complex (NVAbot March, USbot Assaul/Sweep with Airlift in particular).

Another stumbling block might be the general bot instruction in 8.1 through 8.4. There&#039;s been quite a bit of discussion of late in the FitL forums about the precise import of some of these for example in conjunction with the flowcharts.

On a positive note, you won&#039;t have to get every single detail of each bot action absolutely right (I probably rarely do) to have a challenging and enjoyable solo experience.

Finally, something that gamers new to the bots often miss is that victory works somewhat differently in a game involving the bots than in a all players game. Basically, the player cannot win other than by the victory margin at the end of the last (truncated) Coup round, whereas the bots can win at the start of any Coup round.

	<body>I borrowed this from a Boston friend about a week ago and sadly couldn&#039;t get anyone to play it on such short notice.  My gf will be returning it on a visit this weekend, and with UMass opening, I won&#039;t have another chance to give this a shot (I work for housing, Labor Day is our busiest time all year).  So out it came for a solo 2P game.

Witches v Nomads.  I had a couple of rules mistakes, but overall had a ton of fun.  Not sure how I feel about this at 2P, though as both of my races essentially went off in opposite directions once they started generating an economy.  Witches absolutely crushed with 112 points to the Nomads 64.  Given another chance this would likely be a much closer game.

Any suggestions for a good Solo variant?  I have this in TTS and would love to get some more plays in!</body>

There&#039;s a nice one posted there in the &quot;Variants&quot; sub-forum by Alex Peters.  Since finding it and trying it out, it&#039;s the one I always use when playing, and it&#039;s quite enjoyable.

	<body>I have had FP:FR and all of the expansions for a long time and I only started playing it two days ago. Two of my three games were today and I went 1:1.

I only played on recruit and didn’t use any of the expansions. I used the Captain, Generalist and CAFS on the basic board with 4 exit doors. I tried to game the system on my first play today by leaving a POI outside unattended (waiting for the ambulance) and I forgot all about her until after the house collapsed and I had only saved 6 POIs and then noticed the poor soul laying on the ground outside, all alone, just waiting to be rescued. I was so busy fighting the fire and trying to keep more POIs from coming on the board I completely miscounted how many I had already rescued.

I deserved the loss, I promise to try and resist the :devil: urge to game the system in the future and just save the POIs, I feel ashamed. </body>

	<body>Day off for dentist appointment (it hurt!) i played this either side. Using my AI variant and choosing the short game (first to $6,000).

The AI started off slow, it picked up really good claims, but they were always depleted very quickly, so it spent more time, building its tracks getting to the claims!

I found a couple of good coal claims nearby and basically stayed there. Didn&#039;t spend anything and just operated the claim and delivered in one hit. By turn 10 i had the $6,000, while AI only hit $2,500. Nice easy win!!</body>

	<body>I just published the latest blog post about my ongoing campaign in [b][thing=149787][/thing][/b]. [b][blogpost=45487][/blogpost][/b] Unfortunately, between that and another game I can&#039;t talk about yet, I&#039;ve been really stretched for time this past month, and will be for the next couple of weeks at least.

However, I am making sure to take time to play the games in the [b][thread=1293768][/thread][/b]. The deadline to vote is coming up soon, and since I have a game in the contest this year, I want to play as many of the other games as I can.

So far, I&#039;ve been able to try out 3: [b][thing=181560][/thing][/b], [b][thing=182086][/thing][/b], and [b][thing=182047][/thing][/b]. The second one didn&#039;t grab my interest, but the first and the third are real winners in my book. Iwanna&#039;s is a great puzzle-style game driven by a mancala or rondel mechanic, and it&#039;s got a great theme attached. I&#039;ve been playing it on Vassal, since my grayscale printer couldn&#039;t do it justice. Austerity has an equally clever theme and is one of those new &quot;bag-building&quot; style games. It&#039;s super easy to build, and I will definitely be playing it again.

On that subject, I&#039;m planning to do a collection of micro-reviews of the contest games on Entropy. When I did a similar post covering previous years, I had a great guest reviewer in Morten Monrad Pederson, and I&#039;d love to share the spotlight again for this year&#039;s contest. Is there anybody out there who would be interested in collaborating on some mini-reviews of print-and-play games, to be compiled and published this weekend?

Finally, while I highly suggest you try out the two games I highlighted above, I&#039;d also love any feedback on my contest entry, [b][thread=1395780]The Death Worms of Qinesh[/thread][/b]. It&#039;s 3 pages of printed materials with some minor cutting required, and you&#039;ll need some extra euro cubes and d6&#039;s. The central concept is dice allocation: you roll a pair of dice and decide which to allocate to your defensive barrier, which gets tested every 6 rounds, and which to allocate to your action points for picking up and rescuing refugees. I&#039;d be really keen to hear how it feels to others.

On the subject of waiting, guess what FINALLY arrived late last week? I&#039;ll be anxiously waiting for the days when I have the free time to really dig into it.

	<body>I played my first game of this today.  I was relatively easy to learn and the game flows rather smoothly.  I&#039;ve heard this compared to Pandemic and it was hard to break out of the Pandemic mindset at first.  When I started the rules and saw that there were altars, I figured they worked like research stations.  Nope, they did something completely different.  I would say that this game plays similarly to Pandemic but it is definitely not a re-skinned version of the game.

Here&#039;s how the game works.  Because the Israelites fail to follow God, sin creeps up and threatens to overwhelm Israel.  You play prophets through the generations to preach God&#039;s word and try to help keep Israel on the right path.  You win if you are able to build enough altars but lose if all the sin cubes run out, the idols are all placed on the board, or you reach the end of the time track and haven&#039;t won.

Kings of Israel is based on Israel&#039;s early history.  The time track on the side works it&#039;s way through Israel&#039;s Kings.  It starts with Saul and ends with Hoshea.  He was Israel&#039;s last king and the ruler when Assyria conquered Israel and the Israelites were exiled.  It&#039;s very interesting to see Old Testament history laid out like this.  I also found it very fun to see where all these cities were, on a map. When I read through the Old Testament last year, it was pretty tough to visualize where everything was.

I really enjoyed this game.  I won pretty easily, but I think that is for two reasons.  I made a few rules mistakes, and I was playing the normal game.  There is an expert game in the rules, and I&#039;m pretty sure that is how the game is meant to be played.  I was pretty cool because at the beginning of the game, it felt like I was going to win easily, but as the game went on and things got harder, it stopped feeling like victory was eminent.

Here is the board at the end of my game.

[center][ImageID=2650203medium][/center] 

There are a couple of really cool things that happen with the king&#039;s track on the side of the board.  At the end of every round, you move the tracker down to the next king.  If it&#039;s a good king you get to draw a blessing card, basically a good event.  However, if it&#039;s an evil king, you draw a sin and punishment card, basically a bad event.  There are also some kings who had very short reigns, and they basically give you two bad events in a row.

I liked the game on my first play, and I look forward the next plays.  I&#039;ll be curious to see if this and Pandemic both belong in the same collection, but they feel different enough, at first glance, that they just might.

Here&#039;s a cool thing.  The card art for the location cards comes straight from the map.  I was able to lay the card on the board and the artwork matches up perfectly.  I always think that kind of thing is fun!

	<body>I&#039;ll bashfully admit that I&#039;m not normally one to play games solitaire.  But I enjoy Fantastiqa a great deal, so when I came across a solo variant recently, I just had to give it a shot. Short version: I loved it, and have played it almost ten times already in the last few weeks!

For those not familiar with Fantastiqa, it&#039;s a game by Alf Seegert, whose design credits include Road to Canterbury and Musee.  While the game is often described a deckbuilder with a whimsical theme, the real gameplay happens as you move your adventurer on a board, subduing creatures, which then get added to your deck. You can also purchase artifacts and beasts to make your deck more powerful. Points are earned by going on quests. It has a whimsical theme, but definitely captures the feel of adventuring around, and feels much more like an adventure game than a deckbuilder.  I&#039;ve seen it described as a kind of Mage Knight lite, so maybe that gives you an idea of what to expect.  Alf is an English professor, and has drawn extensively on various literary influences in the game, which gives more to appreciate about it.  To find out more, check out my [thread=989982]pictorial review[/thread].

[imageid=2618619 medium inline]

Now on to the solo variant. It&#039;s the one posted by Sky Zero here:

[b][thread=1096944]&quot;Uriel&#039;s Robe&quot; Fantastiqa Solo Player Variant[/thread][/b]

I&#039;ve tried several variants for the game so far, and this is easily the best.  In some respects it is even more fun than a standard multi-player game, because you really need to make skilful tactical use of cards with special abilities like the key icon to access statues, and the magic carpet icon to travel, and cycle through your deck to find the cards you need.  And when using the Creature deck as an end-of-game timer as I do, you really get to have fun with the deck you&#039;ve crafted.

The variant isn&#039;t perfect and still needs some minor polishing.  I&#039;ve come up with my improved version [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/20124954#20124954]here[/url], and no doubt it can benefit from ongoing tinkering.  But it&#039;s a fantastic way to enjoy the game, and I look forward to playing it more often.  Highly recommended!

[floatright][imageid=2617270 inline][/floatright]Good question.  Even though it still needs a little more polishing perhaps, the Uriel&#039;s Robe variant is really fun.  I&#039;ve played it more than half a dozen times already, and had enormous enjoyment out of it.  Several other gamers have found the same. In fact, most times I&#039;ve played it I just wanted to keep on playing!   

Fantastiqa is more of an adventuring game than a deck-building game, so it really lends itself to solitaire play like this. I&#039;m not that familiar with Mage Knight, but I gather that it plays quite well solo, and I&#039;ve seen Fantastiqa described more often as a whimsical and lite Mage Knight.  

The game itself doesn&#039;t come with an official solitaire variant.  It should also be noted that original form of the Uriel&#039;s Robe variant did need some tweaking.  But several suggestions have since been made for refining and polishing it, and the person who came up with the variant plans to play-test some of the ideas I&#039;ve suggested and develop it further.  Even in its current form it works quite well.  One advantage of the Uriel&#039;s Robe variant is that it doesn&#039;t change the game rules much.  

My only concern would be whether replayability would be an issue if only playing Fantastiqa solitaire.  Then again, I&#039;ve played the solo variant about 7 or 8 times already, and I&#039;m long not sick of it. For most people, even that many plays (about an hour each time) might be considered worthwhile.  One additional consideration is that in some respects the solitaire form of the game is almost more fun than a multiplayer game.  It offers an excellent challenge that requires clever skilful and tactical play in ways that a 2-4 player game doesn&#039;t offer, and that makes it very rewarding.  

So I could imagine some people being quite happy with a Fantastiqa purchase simply for solo play only.

I&#039;ve only played it once as a 3p game. It really is a bit lite for my taste, but there was something about it that I found quite engaging.

I shan&#039;t be buying it though as it didn&#039;t strike me as being a satisfying game for soloing (to my taste). I think the interaction was what endeared it to me.

Having said that, I solo games out of necessity rather than choice (I think that is why so many made-for-solo games fall flat for me), so a game has to really grab me to enjoy it solo. Have made so many mistakes that I&#039;m trying hard to learn by them.

Trouble is, 90% of my cardboard pushing is done solo.  :(

	<body>Played another game of Beagle with the expansions. This time it was Darwin, explorer, soldier, missionary and cook. And another failure. It was closer this time because I had the kid and the horse, thus having 2 extra actions and because I cheated. And even so I lost.

Fun game it reminds me of the old poker joke.

	<body>Not happy with one frustrating experience I went for another favourite frustration of mine.

I am going through all the packs in order and I was currently stuck at The Long Dark (4th from Dwarrowdelf).

I play 2 handed with 6 dwarfs and I keep making tweaks every time I open a pack or when I cannot win a challenge.

Well, I managed my easiest victory ever. First of all I started with the 2 Senescal of Gondor cards in my hand, which boosted one of my heros to 3 production per turn from the start, add to that that I had one of the songs, it made possible to play all my cards in one of the hands.

I also had the card that gives +2 (if the current place is subterranean or dark) to all dwarfs, a card to straighten all my dwarfs and a card to cancel a reveal effect.

With this I managed to do 2 missions of over 20. Incredibly in just 3 turns I had won a mission that had stuck as impossible for months.

This game is wonderful</body>

But I had to add genestealers 3 rounds in a row to each pile and they began to swarm all over my marines. Taking one by one. Ok it was not just the genestealers, that die helped them a lot.

I need to play this more often. But I think that every time I play. I had a lot of fun today! :thumbsup:</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve just got back from a long weekend over the Bank Holiday in the UK. We went up to our cottage in the Lake District. As the name might suggest it can sometimes rain a lot so I took along Space Infantry in case the weather was particularly inclement. I figured I&#039;d easily get a campaign done as the missions are so quick. In the end the weather conspired against me and was absolutely glorious so I only got two missions done. :)

The first mission was a disaster. The squad needed to find 4 missing scientists in some caves and had been given the Pilum ATV to assist getting around the surface of the planet. What they hadn&#039;t been told was that the pilot had only recently passed his driving test, and that he&#039;d learned in a milk float and this was his first time driving an ATV. Basically, I failed so many Pilot tests that progress was painfully slow! Tactically I should have aborted the mission to avoid the -1 VP for failure, but after so many poor chit pulls for Pilot checks I kept on convincing myself that the next pull had to be a good one!

The second mission was much more successful. It was a reconnaissance hive mission exploring a Beastmaster lair. I took along a Scout and lots of Intelligence resources and medkits. I like to try and keep moving in hive missions. I got very lucky with an early Intel cache and was able to whiz through the tunnels with minimal resistance. I did have an extremely tough fight on the final Resource Node, which saw everyone getting injured and the hapless Scout being killed, but it wasn&#039;t enough to stop the rest of the squad surviving the successful mission. After the first mission fiasco I was finally able to grant some of the squad Veteran status.

I&#039;ll try and finish the campaign before I get back into Empire of the Sun.

I took a panoramic photo in a spot that is about 5 minutes from our house. Hopefully it conveys why even I didn&#039;t really want to be inside playing games...

Your posts in the game&#039;s forum and [user=Ryanmobile] Ryan[/user]&#039;s posts in the SGOYT geeklist are the reasons why I bought this game.

It might take a while now before the weather co-operates, but I&#039;ll try and play through a mission outdoors somewhere in the Lake District! :)

	<body>I played 2 games today. North Africa again, both times. The biggest problem here (I think) is that the longer the game runs, the tougher it gets to take over that egyptian area. So I tried to take my two Pz units and run for egypt. The other units have to take the fortress asap so that new units can come into play from there.

First game was chaos. Turn 3, both Pz units destroyed and tons of allied units on the map. Let&#039;s start all over again.

[ImageID=2650697 large]

Second game was better. My two Pz units were the killing machines again that I am used to. I decided to take my supplies for battle plans instead for movement. Mistake! I could not reach the fortress this way and rolled the worst thing in the allied round. Add units to fortress tobruk. Two times!

[ImageID=2650698 large]

Anyway, do you see what I saw? Yep. My two Pz units were in reach for the two units in egypt. And those were the last units in the egyptian area. I decided to head for them instead of the fortress, take the egyptian objectives AND defend them. Haha...

[ImageID=2650699 large]

Crazy thing happened. The 1st Arm was a laugh but the 5th Ind got another unit for help AND even pushed me back to where I came from.

The fortress tobruk allies were about to attack and even kicked me out of that area. Exploited after that but I stopped them the next round. Wounded.

New reinforcements in all areas. The fortress units were hunting my units in the west and the new guys in the east were out for blood and destroyed me right there.

	<body>Day 2 and we&#039;re on page 3 already.  Another big month ahead perhaps?

My first game of September and I played it twice taking on [thread=1415265][/thread] created by [user=shaungamer][/user]
Lost both times.  The first time was close (Me -6 authority, Pirates 9 authority) and the second time was a humiliation (Me -8 authority, Pirates 63 authority).

Really enjoyed both games and the challenges Shaun creates just add to the replayability of this game.

I&#039;m now up to 116 plays of this excellent little deck builder.

It&#039;s also the first game I&#039;ve played as part of this challenge that I&#039;ve set myself: 

:star: [geeklist=189816][/geeklist] :star:

:thumbsup: For it&#039;s size it delivers a fantastic thematic solo deck building experience.

:thumbsdown: Some of the expansions don&#039;t work with solo play (e.g. Events).

:thumbsdown: The superb app version affects how often I play the physical version now.

I keep meaning to participate in this challenge, then I see the app version on my iPad and I play the campaign there instead.  It&#039;s vs. the AI rather than &quot;solo&quot; but I think it works great.  I agree with you, the app definitely effects how often I get the physical version to my table as well.  But you can&#039;t play a Shaun challenge with the app, so there is that!

It&#039;s definitely Shaun&#039;s challenges that have kept me playing the physical version.

69 of the 116 games have been since he started doing the challenges.

	<body>It&#039;s pencil, dice and a few sheets of A4. Doesn&#039;t really sound much but together you can get this altogether great, epic awesome game. 
I love it. If you love football manager games you&#039;ll love. It&#039;s that simple.

A word of warning though, you may become so caught up in the game that when your idiotic keeper fails to get higher than a 2 to save the last shot of the match causing you to lose the game. Or your new expensive striker gets injured for six weeks after his first game. Your dice may lose a few dice as they take trips into space.</body>

I love TOS too, but I prefer TOS multi player and this for solo.

I&#039;m going through all the modules now, going add one at a time for a few games to get a feel for each. Then restart the career.

For the sake of printing out a few sheets of A4 it&#039;d be a shame to miss out on this. Even with just the core rules, it is a marvellous football game.

[q=&quot;fortheloveofdice&quot;]How long does this game take to play?[/q]

I find that a &quot;week&quot; of play takes maybe 10-20 minutes. I tend to play a few weeks in a go but I find that the game rolls along quite nicely and suddenly I realise I&#039;ve been playing for 2 hours.

You can take a break whenever you want, but the end of each week is quite a natural pause. It&#039;s like the Football Manager computer game - play for as long or short a time in one sitting as you want.

I started my first season a couple of days ago, so I&#039;m a beginner. I tend to be interrupted in my gaming quite a bit (by various members of the family) so I find it difficult to give a time-frame as to how long a week takes to play. However, in terms of the rules and procedures, it&#039;s not a complex, laborious process to get through a week, so I think the designer&#039;s 10 to 20 mins sounds about right even for a beginner.

Furthermore, the amount of stuff to do and think about changes every week so the time you consume changes accordingly.

Also, as Al notes above, this really is an easy game to get on the table ---print out a good chunk of paper, get a d6 and a pen is all that&#039;s needed, no cutting out cards etc whatsoever--- so you don&#039;t lose much time or effort by giving it a try.

On the other hand, it seems to me that you&#039;ll get progressively more and more depth out of the gaming experience the further you progress in the season or as your team gets promoted (or not!) to higher divisions. So in that sense you&#039;ll be investing time into the game, although at that point you&#039;ll probably be wanting to make that investment anyway.

I&#039;m loving the game and plan to write a SGOYT entry at some point this month.

Well, Al, that&#039;s a very interesting question. One thing is certain: in no way is FM inferior to TOS. Sure, ToS looks great but they are both well oiled games.

There are a couple of things that stand out in FM for me. To me it feels like an epic game in which you develop your team from ground up and follow its journey from the humble beginnings to glory. In theory, I guess you could play the game forever. You&#039;re more involved and developing the players through the kind of training you expose them to, I like that a lot. Also, I quite like the ability to adjust tactics mid-game so a match is not just about to tossing the dice. There&#039;s [i]a lot[/i] of tossing the dice in FM, although its mostly minor tweaks to the overall machine so no particular roll feels big in itself.

I&#039;ve played a couple of incarnations of football manager, and enjoy it for a couple of hours. But after about 10 matches it is yeah, whatever...

It&#039;s the computer version of a deckbuilder to me and I like them not.

Oh yes, the match rolls are big, potentially. But otherwise, all the injury rolls, form rolls, transfer market rolls, each one may feel a bit like a drop in the ocean.

There are some amazingly well written session reports in the FM forum by the way. They give a nice narrative account of the game and matches in particular. I had some good laughs recently reading some of those even though at that point I didn&#039;t even know the game.

Good use of the &quot;Half-timbered house&quot; (which provides 1 point for every immediate building built) and the Glassworks (3 points for glass at the end instead of one) got me within eyesight of the &quot;winning&quot; score of 30.</body>

Hi Reverend

I am thinking about getting either Snowdonia or Glass Road. I was wondering which game you prefer between these two for replayability and fun?

They are both excellent games, you can&#039;t go wrong with either, but Glass Road hits my table more than any other game I own! Something about the tableau building and the rondel resource management system just pleases me to no end. So I guess my answer to your question is Glass Road (but you should buy Snowdonia too, very good game and quite different from Glass Road).

Do you have a good storage solution for this game? 
Right now I&#039;m using tons of obnoxious baggies.  I love this game, but pretty much all of my other games are more well organized and, therefore, get played more often.

I keep the buildings in three separate cloth draw bags, just pull them out and put them on the table. Each complete player set (cards, land tiles, resources) is in a separate bag. The extra land tiles are in their own bag. Works for me.

I have both and would have a hard time choosing between them.

Snowdonia does however have a number of very inexpensive expansions/scenarios so that&#039;s something to consider in terms of replayability.

Been on my shelf a month, thanks to you, Rev, and I still haven&#039;t opened it. :shake:

In fact, why do I sit here, catching up reading what others are playing, when I could be playing something myself...?

	<body>I played 2 games of this after work. I&#039;d only played [thing=37380][/thing] previously and I think I prefer this to that game. The build in solo rules are basically play 8 rounds and try to beat 100 points or your previous highest score.

[b]Game 1[/b]
I wasn&#039;t really sure of what I should be trying to get first (extra dice/goods/food) or what to build. I ended up with a mixture of everything.

Completed:
4 monuments for 25 points
5 developments for 16 points
no bonuses or wealth
19 tribute
5 disasters

Total: 55 points

Not bad for my first attempt but well off the target.

[b]Game 2[/b]
The second time I realised that I would need as many dice as I could get to build monument and developments. unfortunately the dice do not always roll the way we want them to and in getting extra dice I was not using workers for monuments. I also played 2 rounds with 1 fewer dice than I should have had but I couldn&#039;t remember what I had done in those 2 rounds to undo the actions so I just took the hit of not using that dice for those rounds.

Completed:
2 monuments for 19 points
6 developments for 31 points
no bonuses
22 tribute
7 disaster

Total: 65 points.

:thumbsup: - Quick dice game.
:thumbsup: - Fun to play.
:thumbsup: - Solo plays the same as multiplayer (with one or two minor exceptions).
:thumbsdown: - Box doesn&#039;t include a pencil/marker yet it is required to play the game.
:thumbsdown: - I don&#039;t like games that include sheets you need to write on as I always worry that I will run out of them at some point. I know you can print your own sheets but I needed a second :thumbsdown:</body>

[b]Game:[/b] 1/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b]1 Drone per objective
I&#039;m on a roll with this game having won 3 in a row.  This movie is definitely tougher than the first.  The aliens advance quickly.  At one point in the game both avatars were a bad strike draw away from death.  Once I got the sentry guns setup it was smooth sailing from there.  The Queen appeared pretty quickly and I was prepared.
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NRr3L0gkk_HSdG9P61xoEYkp9KUHJsJvCIPNXiO-LXM=s400[/IMG]

:star: This game really shines at telling a story and creating a tense atmosphere.  No other card game I have played come close in that aspect.

[b]Game:[/b] 2/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b] 0 Drone
4th win in a row.  I&#039;m starting to wonder if I&#039;m cheating :)  I played as the Medic and Commander.  The Commander&#039;s ability to gain a cost 3 card came in very handy early on.  I was able to gain a lot of Critical Analysis cards.  Discard a card from your hand and draw 2.  I had three in one hand at one point.  Very powerful when you can string them together.  I really like the cards from this movie.  Out of the first three movies this is my favorite to play.  My end two turns alowed me to draw a lot of cards when ended up giving me a MAJOR victory.  Well, that&#039;s what I&#039;m calling it any way.  27 combat to kill the Queen.
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XV7aRl54j6vESXjpDaAlinn2auFITMmkxY5_IBfxsKY=s800[/IMG]

[b]Game:[/b] 3/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b] 0 Drone and 1 Hive card in the complex
There are some games, like my 2nd play of this movie, where everything works out perfectly.  The cards you want are in the HQ and you always have enough recruit points to gain them.  You always seem to have enough attack to scan and keep the aliens at bay.  Class/crew abilities are constantly activated for bonuses.  The events and hazards appear at the least impactful moments.  This was NOT that game...
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MGrTZTBJkkNsWFGKzCXnWhDC-TRMfOT5MflMtaiNgQY=s800[/IMG]

I was able to hold off the queen for three rounds in the combat zone.  Body armor helped.  But it didn&#039;t matter how much attack I could generate anyway.  I could not get enough recruit to rescue the character which had to be done before attacking the queen.  I can attribute my loss to 3 things:
1 - gaining attack cards early rather than recruit.
2 - lack of cohersion in my decks.  I rarely had any combos
3 - due to 1 &amp; 2 I was unable to gain the cards that I really needed.  Which leads to the real reason for my loss...
[size=18]weak hands[/size]

	<body>Reading a lot of the big piles of unplayed games of some of our members here, or their &quot;neighbors&quot; ;) I checked out how high mine would be...

Stopped when my kitchen table couldn&#039;t hold any more and decided to create a geeklist instead... to get an overview about this month theme... &quot;Catch up&quot; - month.

So started with this solo playable game from victory points game...
After three round with different combos and winning every time with the same tactic (gather one relict and kill the necromancer) it already lost a bit of its thrill...
[ImageID=2651199]

Rechecked the rules several times to see if I did something wrong but it&#039;s just that the dice-gods seems to like me these days...

:thumbsup: Nice lasercut components
:thumbsup: especially with the bundle a loootttt of characters to chose from
:thumbsdown: felt easy
:thumbsdown: felt repetitive 

For a deeper insight in my this month theme I invite you to check out and comment on [geeklist=196079]September - My &quot;Catch Up&quot;-Month[/geeklist]</body>

I wasn&#039;t overly thrilled with this game. The base game is boring, so I immediately went to throwing all of the NB stuff in, it was better. The best thing about this game is the characters, I like the character abilities and special cards, that adds the flavor.

You have to play this with all the bells and whistles. (Though the base game would be good Co-op intro for beginning gamers).

Still love it, myself. It needs the expansion now otherwise it becomes a bit rote. The first expansion with the quest deck is enough to invigorate it and change things up. I&#039;m currently messing around with expansions two and three - and, of course, keeping an eye out for the fourth.

	<body>I did it! I finally beat Journey Down the Anduin.  I played using the mod suggested by the kind people here after the last time I was moaning about the difficulty -  I didn&#039;t deal shadow cards to enemies when they attacked. It made for a far more enjoyable experience.

One other thing that helped was the fact I had forest snare straight away to keep the troll busy so he couldn&#039;t attack and raise my threat. I managed to deal with him and then get a lot of characters into play who helped with questing. In the end it was a lot easier than previous times I&#039;ve played it. It still took me 10 turns to beat, final score 168. 

This mod may well have salvaged the game for me until I get better at tweaking my decks. </body>

This game used to frustrate the hell out of me, and not in a good way. Took me a while to stomach implementing a mod, but I stopped dealing shadow cards and it totally salvaged the game for me. Now it still feels challenging but not as punishing and out of control. Don&#039;t plan to put them back.

Definitely no shame. That&#039;s why they put it in there. Same reason they make Nightmare mode. Different challenges for different people. Play it this way, then someday you may want to visit it again with Shadow cards. A whole new experience that doesn&#039;t cost you a penny :)

	<body>Only have a minute but I set up the Flash Point challenge for this month. Looking forward to tackling it and forcing myself to come to grips with the new rules!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/S69wXY3.jpg[/IMG]

More to come.

[size=18][b]UPDATE[/b][/size]

Well, I finished it..... and beat it! Check out that red firefighter! (Note: Components may have been used improperly for dramatic effect). 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wsqn94g.gif[/IMG]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UtSZ3ij.jpg[/IMG]

Scores me a cool hundred, according to the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1427707/flash-point-fire-rescue-dangerous-waters-challenge]contest rules[/url].

:thumbsup: Fun, tense session. While the fire never got out of control, that was because I was doing my utmost to keep it that way, switching roles as appropriate. If I&#039;d played with my houserules (4 firefighters randomly or semi-randomly chosen, false POIs are hazmats), things might have gone differently. As it was, the Generalist and CAFS were awesome for this map and the starting Hazmat Tech to Captain to Paramedic helped quite a bit as well (especially the Hazmat Tech as there is NO way to dispose of hazmats in this map except with him). 

:thumbsdown: Nitpicking but this game took a long while (over an hour) because the first part of it was knocking down those early fires. I didn&#039;t start saving POIs until later on.... but I guess that&#039;s thematic. Still, getting those fires under control felt a bit like &quot;setting up the game so i can start playing&quot;, which is where saving POIs concurrently with keeping fires down happens. 



I can see why people would not like this game but, for me, it&#039;s a perfect morning game. Plays in an hour, lots of stuff happening, good decisions with pushing your luck. The extra rules regarding fireproof doors and bulkheads were cool too (although I only had 1 fireproof door activate; and it worked!)

Glad to own this :)</body>

Red survived! Blue was explosion fodder :D

Btw, that explosion never happened. In the movie based off this real life episode, of course it did (he also somehow installed a fireproof door between his rescue victims and the hallway). Hollywood, amirite?

The explosion marker came with the 2nd Story expansion.

	<body>Ok I played the game that got me introduced to Victory Point Games. 
Played 3 games of this so far today. This is the second edition. 

The first two games were without any of the optional cards. 

I got my highest so far with just the regular cards in my first game as I scored 45 points. Things were pretty dicey most of the game but I held off until the end to score a minor victory.

The second game lasted only 5 turns as I pretty much got bum rushed by the Zulus and was unable to hold them off. Did score 20 points though as I did take some of them out.

For my 3rd game I added all the optional cards which can help you score more points but you have to subtract 1 point for each card you add so you start with -19 in the hole adding all 19 cards. Playing this way it seems like a victory just to survive to the nighttime. I did survive until the night but was overran soon after. Scored 18 points but after subtracting my 19 points I ended up with -1.
I think the most I ever scored playing this way was like 7 or 8 points and I don&#039;t think I ever made it to the end.

Still a fun game. Glad I broke this out to play.  </body>

One of my favourite solo games. This and cruel necessity.
I&#039;ve got this set up at the minute half way through a game with basic. I must admit I enjoy it so much every time I haven&#039;t even tried it with any extra cards yet !! Haha

Yeah I don&#039;t know adding the extra cards is pretty brutal. This can be tough  without the extra cards.

Could anyone recommend some sleeve for the cards, please? Never bought any before, but this feels like something I need to consider it for. (Plus, fifty cards, seems like a pack.)

I bought these in bulk [imageid=2657056] as I had a few games to sleeve at the same time.

It&#039;s acceptable, but I do plan on upgrading to a premium, thicker sleeve. When this geek list stops making my buy games. 

As you can see, it&#039;s not quite a perfect fit. Little bit big all around, probably too much for some.

There is also this  [geeklist=164572]Geeklist[/geeklist] which is a good resource for starting sleeving

I use those sleeves too (for LE: Alien/Predator, D-Day at Tarawa and Star Trek: Five Year Mission). They are not perfect but I paid $0.79/100 sleeves. This meant I could sleeve, for example, Predator (700 cards) for less than $6. With fancier sleeves (that run around $4/50 sleeves) that would have cost me $56! I would rather deal with less than perfect sleeves for $6 than spend enough money to buy another game to get perfect ones.

Yeah I always budget sleeve to start with, then if I&#039;m playing the game a lot or really like it I&#039;ll mark it down for an upgrade. (I&#039;ve only done two, [thing=90137][/thing] and [thing=39941][/thing]

Apart from [thing=138161][/thing]with most of its expansions. I&#039;m happy to leave that, the cost / reward isn&#039;t worth it to me.

	<body>Movie 2 on the table, with Alien3 on deck. Played the Medic.

This one has a LOT of ways to avoid strikes, which I used thoroughly. &quot;Body Armor&quot; was my friend, and with gaining a lot of the Vigilant cards, I was able to cruise through to killing the queen on a space with the sentry guns.

Two down. Two to go. I&#039;ll crank up the difficulty afterwards, and gonna order those sleeves next week (and maybe a Broken Token organizer.)</body>

BT has an organizer for it? Be right back.

...

Oh, hell yeah. That game needs one. I just ordered one from them for BSG. Damn, shoulda looked around more and probably would have saved money on shipping with this one. 

I printed out some extremely nice and fancy section dividers and cut and laminated them. The character cards have all the symbols on them so you can quickly see who offers what.

	<body>Tonight I played the Cold Front scenario (#5) as the Germans against the Russians.  Immediately I knew that the placement of trenches was critical in order to deal with the massive number of Russian Elite troops that were going to storm my way.  I positioned a few trenches near the only bridge crossing the river, and with the snow on the map, each &quot;clear&quot; hex had an additional 1/2MP cost, so I figured I&#039;d be able to take some liberties with clearing them out.  I split my troops through with a few positioned towards the mid/high part of the map in case they tried to come around and flank or exit my side of the map.  Sounds like I had a plan... and then all hell broke loose.

I was able to take pot shots at the Russians, taking out troop after troop as they approached the bridge, but towards the bottom of the map, they made their way out of LOS so I couldn&#039;t get a bead on them.  Meanwhile the Russians towards the top &quot;camped&quot; out in the warmth of the buildings and repositioning for an assault.  

Unfortunately you can&#039;t use OPfire against the Advance cards, and the Russians were able to advance a troop into the trench where I was and killed my rile team in melee combat, taking over a critical position on the map.  From there it just got worse and worse.  My other team was too far out of position to help, and the reinforcements from the Russians started to push on the top of the map, crossing the frozen stream and heading for me.  Eventually the Germans surrendered after receiving too many casualties. </body>

	<body>Gave the Star Realms Challenge #10 a try tonight.  I won, huzzah!  Final score: 11.  I really enjoy this little game, even though I play it more often on my iPad than on the table.  Shaun&#039;s challenges really make this game shine, however - so this will likely always see the occasional physical play.  

:thumbsup: So much game in a such little box.

:thumbsup: Shaun&#039;s challenges are awesome!

:thumbsdown: I don&#039;t sleeve, and cards are starting to show wear already.

:thumbsup: Game is cheap, so if the cards get bad, I&#039;ll just buy another copy!</body>

	<body>I played this the other day, and since I was learning the rules, I played a two-player game. I simply played both sides. I really enjoyed it because there was a lot of decisions to be made regarding research. When to spend your dice to create a blend (which gives you points) and when to spend your dice on research (which improves your dice rolling).  

Tonight I played the solo game. It seemed like it would be pretty cool. The two solo opponents have different abilities which is a nice touch, and I went up against Sacchar, Inc. I also thought I would just start out on normal. I got creamed. I lost 21-14. The AI was a points machine. 

Maybe I should have started on easy, so I played again. I got just as thoroughly ground into dirt. I lost again 21-14. 

Now that might not seem like such a terrible defeat, but the AI was always in the lead and there was never any doubt he wouldn&#039;t win. 

I feel like I&#039;m doing something wrong. There wasn&#039;t really any of the decisions about research or blends that I liked so much in the two-player game. It was a simple go as fast as you can to keep the AI from scoring all those points. 

Does anyone, who&#039;s played this, have any advice? I&#039;m pretty sure I played the rules correctly. Maybe there is a common mistake I didn&#039;t realize I made. 

[b]Edit 1[/b]
I played three more times this morning.

[u]Play 1[/u]: This was a much more fun play of this game.  I played against OMNIBlend Transglobal, and won!  It was really close, I won 21 - 19, and eeked out the win on the last turn. I completed the yellow research (Flip Bean) which pushed me to 21. Yes!  Gary was right, OMNIBlend is a much easier opponent.

[u]Play 2[/u]: I went for it again, and won again.  This time it was even closer.  I won 21-20.  I was able to snatch the Featured Blend out from under Topps at the last minute and take the victory.

[u]Play 3[/u]: Because this game is so quick, it went for another round.  This time I wanted to try out something strange.  I only focused on completing research.  I grabbed the Rainbow Blend at that beginning but after that, I only used my dice for research.  I was curious if I could complete them all and, combined with the Rainbow Blend points, win the game.  Nope.  That was a very dumb strategy.  I lost 21-13.  Haha.  It was worth a shot and since the game plays so quickly, it was no big deal.

These games were a lot more fun.  In both the games I won, I completed on research.  I would not have won without it.  My biggest worry was that the tension of using dice for points or for research was lost in the solo game.  I was wrong.  Research is still a necessity.  I am very pleased how these games went, and I feel like I actually beat the AI instead of got lucky with the dice.  My feelings are coming back around, which I&#039;m very glad about.  Next up, is Nick&#039;s solo variant.</body>

I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything specific you&#039;re doing wrong, from the sound of it.  If the AI gets a rainbow blend early, it&#039;s pretty hard to get it off him, and that rainbow is a points machine for it.

But just to check:
- You&#039;re using the 2-player scoring, right?
- The AI is getting rid of the feature blend when it degrades from 3, right (unlike human players who can keep going to 2)?

I always found Sacchar Inc to be the easier of the two AIs.  Maybe I&#039;ve just not played it enough.  I tend to play against both AIs at once, as they then sort-of balance each other [see my variant rules for playing both in the game&#039;s page].

I have a rules question: The AI moves his token down when he creates a blend and up when he can&#039;t create a blend. Does the token move down while a blend is on the featured blend coaster as well? 

For instance, his token is on 3. He creates a featured blend, so it moves down to 2. On his next turn, the featured blend degrades. Does the token move down to 1?

	<body>Another fun play of this thematic dice-chucker.

The game has two ways to score, a VP-based historical comparison and a basic &quot;how many positions did you capture&quot; number.

[imageid=2651778 large]

This game was a disaster. With several brigades wiped out entirely I ended up with a historical &quot;Severe Defeat&quot; and a &quot;Poor&quot; result of two Union positions captured.

This game is very luck based, with lots of dice rolling and chit pulling. However, this is a great way to represent a historical battle where the player&#039;s side faced a terrible defeat against bad odds. In spite of the randomness, there are a lot of interesting decision points:

1 - How and when to use the General&#039;s abilities for each division
2 - If and when to use the Longstreet and Lee bonuses (which provide great benefits but a chance of a serious reduction in VPs at the end)
3 - Which order to activate your divisions (keep in cover longer, push over the wall to make an adjacent divisions job easier, risk moving further into heavy fire to reveal more &quot;fire&quot; markers at the end of your turn etc.)
4 - Keep rolling to push over an obstacle to move out of a high-risk artillery zones vs. risking being pushed back to your rally point

I thoroughly enjoy my plays of this game so far, it is very exciting every time you roll the dice.

I always think of this as solo Can&#039;t Stop with a civil war theme. I often find myself saying &quot;I should have stopped!&quot; when playing this.

Me too! I love the tension between wanting to play it safe but only having a limited amount of time to reach the Union positions. Got this recently in a trade and I am loving it. Makes my heart pound with excitement as I am rolling the dice.

	<body>I am waiting to win. I played the German Solo last month in which I lasted through December 25, 1944. For me, the result was the same as Ardennes &#039;44. Bastogne was captured with the 2nd Panzer and Panzer Lehr on December 19, 1944, but I was unable to get the 1SS and 12SS Panzer past the wooded regions in front of Verviers before the clock ran out. Also, the 7th Armee never even got to Ettlebruck.

So, I decided to play the Allied Solo this month to try to learn what I keep doing wrong with the Battle of the Bulge games as the Germans. I am still not dead after 4 days. I have learned four things. First, I am way too concerned with flank protection, so much so that I dilute the point of the spear too much. Second, I keep getting 116th Panzer stuck behind St. Vith. Third, I didn&#039;t understand what Von Heydte&#039;s paradrop actual purpose could be. Its actual purpose is to disrupt the placement of allied reserves. Fourth, the Allied Solo AI cheats. 

O.K., so the Allied Solo AI cheats. So what? You have to give the German player some advantage as it can&#039;t really anticipate what the Allied Player is going to do. For the most part, I think the AI is quite brilliant, especially the detachment and reserve system which ensures protection of the flanks of the panzer spearheads, advances hidden forces, and augments significant attacks. It allows masses of panzers to grind forward single-minded toward their objectives. I am all for that, I just think that are two areas where the Germans give themselves an unprecedented advantage. 

The first area is the initial setup which is handled by cards that simulates the results of the first German attacks. When compared with the German Solo system, the results that come out of that are pretty unlikely in German Solo system, unless the German player is very lucky with the chit draws. Or, the Allied player is a complete buffoon who decided to stand and fight rather than retreat and then quit after seeing how bad he did leaving you to clean up his mess. I think though on some level one can argue that this represents the total confusion of the first day.

The second area as I see it is that the German player can infiltrate through any line that&#039;s not wall to wall which is something he can&#039;t do in the German solo. That really makes it really easy to breach most lines at relatively low odds and push allied units in directions that they don&#039;t want to go opening holes that aren&#039;t available in the German solo.

So, with all that in mind, back to the game in progress. The following photographs document the situation of at the dawn of December 20 after 4 hard days of fighting.
[IMG]https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2650555_lg.jpg[/IMG]
In the 6th SS Panzer Armee sector, the Germans did their typical attacks for an Ardennes game with the 3rd Fallschirmer and the 1st SS Panzer destroying the 14th Cav in the Losheim gap. They then proceeded to capture Bulligen which put pressure on Elsenborn from the south while the 12th SS Panzer pushed around Rocherath-Krinkelt to the north helping the LXVII corp capture Monschau, putting pressure on Elsenborn, and surrounding  Rocherath-Krinkelt - the 2nd ID is a much stronger formation in Ardennes &#039;44. Then, Pieper infiltrated around to the back of Elsenborn on the the 17th surrounding it. Elsenborn was reduced on the 17th, and Rotherath-Krinkelt held until the 19th.

Meanwhile, the LXVII corp after taking Monschau moved south and relieved some of the units of the 1st SS Panzer from their duties besieging Rocherath-Krinkelt. Those elements with the all of the 12th SS Panzer oozed around the 7th Armor CCA on the 18th which had dug in in the woods along the Malmedy-Eupen road and destroyed it relieving Von Heydte&#039;s paratroops which had been messing with the deployment of the 30th ID and the 1st ID. 150th did it&#039;s driving through the ZOC thing and wound up north of Verviers revealing the final 6th Armee objective to be Liege and getting trapped by the 30th ID. The following day, the 19th, the same battle group slightly reinforced oozed around a regiment of the big red one, captured Spa, and pushed it aside to the northwest. That forced one regiment to pull back from Malmedy to Stavelot to protect the approaches to Trois Pontes.

In the process of all this, the German 1st SS and 12th SS panzer were heavily attrited. They also don&#039;t control any of the main roads, so their supply lines are tenuous to advance further unless they take Stavelot. I can&#039;t call them contained, but they are seriously hurt. Luckily, the 2nd SS Panzer Corps and 3rd Panzer didn&#039;t show up take part in the fight on the 19th. With the 3rd AD moving into the area on the 20th, it&#039;s possible that the worst is over in this sector.

[IMG]https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2650556_lg.jpg[/IMG]

In the 5th armee sector, things were probably the worst. The dummkopf that was playing the Allied side got the regiment of the 28th ID in front of Clervaux killed which left the road to Bastogne wide open. St Vith was also wide open and the 116th Panzer got across the Our causing enough losses to the regiment of 28th ID that was defending it that it rendered it ineffective as a blocking unit. The 106th also got hit hard by the LXVI Corps with two regiments surrounded and one reduced. I cobbled all the survivors into a defense of St. Vith and Vielsam and reinforced St Vith with 7th Armor CCB. 

Meanwhile, 9th Armor CCB and the engineers played cat and mouse along the road to Bastogne with the 2nd Panzer and Panzer Lehr whose objective was Houffalize. That only postponed the inevitable for about a day and Bastogne was captured on the 18th before the 101st could arrive. The 101st arrived later on the 18th where they tried to establish a line along the Ourthe, but only got as far as establishing a line from St. Hubert to La Roche before the Panzer crossed the bridges. There they were able to coral the Panzers into attacking from single hexes at the rivers edge. That caused the Panzers enough losses that they actually dispersed during the first attack of the day, but the 101st got pushed back across the river from La Roche with enough losses that they had to be replaced with the 9th Armor CCB which had survived its encounter and had to abandon it&#039;s defense of Houffalize to come help. The survivors from La Roche went to Manhay to recover. That pretty much arrested the panzers advance for the rest of the day which allowed two Combat Commands of 10th Armor to backstop them later in the day.

Back in the LXVI Corps area, elements of the 116th Panzer, LXVI corp besieged St. Vith while the rest of LXVI corps, the 116th Panzer, and the 560 reduced the two surrounded 106th Infantry regiments.

On the 19th, the 2nd Panzer and Panzer Lehr with the Fuhrer Begleit brigade tried to resume their advance to their next objective, Rochfort, but only managed to advance slightly with significant losses against dug in defenders of the 101st and 10th AD CCB in the forests in front of Marche. During that day, three regiments of the 82nd which had been delayed by the indecisiveness of Eisenhower moved into the area to further backstop the 101st. The other regiment of the 82nd with the 17th airborne was left back in the north at Werbomont to defend it from the 1SS and 12th SS should they past the big red one.

While that was a relatively major accomplishment, the LXVI and LVII corps were still able to capture St. Vith freeing them up to besiege Vielsalm the next day.

[IMG]https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2650557_lg.jpg[/IMG]
The 7th Armee sector was also pretty bad. Yet another regiment of the 28th at Vlanden also got flipped which left Diekirche and Ettlebruck wide open. It had to beat a hasty retreat to Diekirche where it was forced back across the bridges to Ettlebruck which the Germans managed to capture on December 17. Luckily, the Germans were focused on Mersch which allowed 4th ID to establish and dig into a defensive line in front of Arlon by the 18th while the 9th AD delayed the boys in pink in front of Mersch and then slipped across the river Alzette to safety. That move abandoned the remaining unit of 4th which had retreated from Echternach to Consdorf to the LXXX corps.

Even though these forces are relatively weak, I think they&#039;ll be able to hold out until 3rd Corps arrives.

So, I think we are doing OK. I expect to lose Vielsalm to the 116th Panzer today, but I may be able to hold up both the big spearheads. The 6th Panzer Armee sector really depends on how 2nd SS Panzer Corps shows up. If it comes into the fight today, it looks like it will probably spend the whole day attacking units blocking the supply line which means I don&#039;t think Verviers or Liege are in danger today. I expect Stavelot will be the target. In the 5th Panzer Armee sector, I am pretty sure we will be pushed back close enough to Rochfort that I will see where 5th Panzer Armee intends to cross the Rhine, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll break through. If they manage to make it to Rochfort, it looks like they&#039;ll have lost quite a bit of their punch just because they have to drop off units to protect their flanks until the 116th is able to catch up. Finally, I think the 4th will hold in the 7th Armee sector.

Blech. I mistakenly played the VDH unit to a town hex thinking its point was to go grab some fuel. Have to fix that in next video. 

I cannot figure out its purpose now. I played it though so I&#039;ll have to put it somewhere.

Kurt, the primary impact of VDH is that, unless it lands isolated, arriving Allied reserve units must must be placed at least three hexes away from it. This can really hamper placement of Allied V Corps units. Secondarily the Germans gain a VP if able to link up with VDH.

I can&#039;t really expose the board to more light, because it&#039;s under plexi. The reflections white out of the board below.

	<body>Played 5 games of this so that I could rank it as part of my [geeklist=189816]quest to decide on my top 20 solo games in time for the People&#039;s Choice Top 100[/geeklist].  You can go there and see where it ranks if you want.

I managed 3 wins and 2 losses. One of the losses was my worst score ever - an 8. :shake:

[imageid=2651951]Early in Game 5

I still enjoy this PnP game that was made for me by [user=mo7189][/user] (he probably wants me to stop mentioning it but I won&#039;t).  It&#039;s a fun little puzzle.

It is on the easy side but I seem to have fun every time I play it and it takes up almost no space on the shelf so it stays.

:thumbsup: A nice little brain teaser with a very British theme.

:thumbsdown: Too easy - I have an 83% win rate in my last 30 games.

:thumbsdown: The app version is just as much fun - although some of the scoring seems wrong.</body>

	<body>Advanced solo mode.
Setup:
- Heroes: Professor X, Angel and The Punisher;
- Mastermind: Magneto;
- Villains: Radiation and Phalanx.
- Scheme: Save Humanity.

I had never played with The Punisher and now I find out how powerful he can be. It was a great start, I was getting my deck stronger and was able to beat Magneto twice when there were two bystanders in the scheme. But then I was getting a lot of times 7hits (Magneto needs 8) during my turns.
I really thought I were going to beat the evil this time, but things got complicated. I was careless and left a bystander in the HQ that was KO on the next turn. 2/3 turns later another scheme made me KO one of my rescued bystanders and that was it (when I finally would have 8hits to beat Magneto again).

Evil won. Final score: -- (forgot to score)

	<body>This just arrived today to much anticipation, and it certainly did not disappoint.

The game is reasonably simple yet quite deep and you must look several moves ahead.  I enjoyed every part of it and amazingly won the first game, the dice gods were kind, although I was down to one space marine.  I re-read the rules to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was) and immediately played a second game and was destroyed at the third location.

I bought this specifically to play solo and it was worth every cent.  I&#039;ll play through a few more times and try and resist buying the expansions tonight.</body>

	<body>[size=9]Only a little while ago, I decided to take the plunge - playing a number of my co-operative games alone, and looked into a few variants of games I love, like Star Realms. I enjoyed playing these games so much, actively preferring a number of the solo gameplay experiences to their multiplayer counterparts; so I decided to invest a little more time and money into solo-gaming and pick up a game or two designed, specifically, for solitaire play.

After drooling over some games, like [thing=142854]Infection: Humanity&#039;s Last Gasp[/thing], and reflecting on budgets etc. it seemed that Friday was the perfect place to take the &quot;next step&quot; - and, wow, what a game! Despite assiduously and comprehensively defeating me, I have thoroughly enjoyed the game so far, and look forward to finally defeating the pirates before moving on to level two.

Now, I just need to wait &#039;til I can afford the likes of Infection...[/size]    [size=7]and maybe Mage Knight...    [/size]   [size=5]maybe even Darkest Knight...[/size]</body>

Welcome Richie.  Nice to have another Brit on board.

This is a great place to start.  An excellent solo game and needs a slight adjustment of strategy to beat each level.

Have fun.

Thanks man. I&#039;ll probably cave-in and get the digital version soon - it&#039;d certainly be the sensible thing to do financially! But I&#039;m gonna hold out just a little longer in case I have the opportunity to pick up a physical copy, I think.

I would hold out for the physical copy. I tend to play Infection a little less than Friday, but I enjoy it very much. It has a great theme and is very challenging. You should enjoy it if you like the theme.

(&quot;... hold out ...&quot;, get it: Wait!)

Talk about [b]waiting[/b]...

I wouldn&#039;t normally do this but considering the theme of the month and how near I am to getting back to gaming I couldn&#039;t hold back.  I&#039;m actually posting about a game that I haven&#039;t quite played yet. :blush:

The kids had been off school for 10 weeks, no fuss, no bother, but not a lot of gaming either.  They started back Monday just gone and hence a few games of Mistfall amongst other things.  Today I had planned my first ever play of this (one of too many not yet played games in my collection) - it arrived during the school holidays (quite early on IIRC) and I&#039;ve been [b]waiting, waiting, waiting[/b] to get it to the table.  Whilst I [b]waited [/b]I read and re-read the rulebook, after [b]waiting [/b]some more I watched Ricky&#039;s vid again, followed by some more [b]waiting[/b].

Today was the day, except, the boy after 2 days back in school gets a chest infection and needs the rest of the week off.  So while he dozed and I [b]waited [/b]to do the Flo Nightingale bit this morning I opened the box anyway, threw out the insert, sorted bits and pieces into a handy plano (one of my favourite activities for any new game), set up and ran through the first Cycle.

The rulebook seems comprehensive (I only had 1 question unanswered) but is a bit all over the place with trying to ease players into it and layering things on - why isn&#039;t there a good overarching round summary?  Play tripped along nicely once I understood the flow and it seems like a game to get stuck into.

Sadly I still can&#039;t tick this one of as having been played so I must [b]wait [/b]a little longer.

[center][imageid=2652226medium][/center]

:thumbsup: Nice enough components, colourful map
:thumbsdown: Rubbish insert

[b]EDIT 11/9/15:[/b]
Well the boy went back to school but then the wife went off sick so I am only today able to get a play in.  Scored 36 medals (50 is required for a Baronial victory).  Good game, tough decisions and annoying insurgents but I can see ways to improve my gameplay (I think!).</body>

I had the exact same thought about the insert. I put all the components into baggies and threw out the insert.

Yes, more you sell the lower the price goes but also prices fluctuate through Government intervention and a die roll at the start of each cycle.  It&#039;s my first real economic solo.

I&#039;ve wanted to try a game like this, solitaire. Love me games with a good market. Does it feel natural in the 1P game how the prices rise and fall? Ideally, an AI market would work like a COIN flowchart or the new Conflict of Heroes system.

Someone with more experience of the game should really answer you but from my initial feel I would say no.  The (single) die roll at the start of each turn increases all 4 commodities one two or three levels.  The Government (auto play) decreases two of them by 1 each or does nothing, the Government when in[i](the pocket of)[/i]fluenced by your Industrial Baron can increase or decrease 1 commodity.  Pretty simple stuff really - but I could be selling it short.

EDIT: No commodities are only sold - either International Market (high &amp; low prices) or Local Market (low prices).

Gave this another play this morning and put in 5 black/debt. I quickly took on more Red/Crime cubes, which did not help the situation. I got close to losing (Public Safety was at 1) but used some money to get rid of some reds and then finished the black.

It&#039;s a fun little engine to try to beat. The default is a bit easy ... I may add another black and a couple of red cubes next time. Has anyone tried the advanced cards?

If you are scared of ever doing a print-and-play, it doesn&#039;t get easier than this. Print out the sheet, grab a bag and borrow some cubes from other games and give it a go. I laminated my sheet and use a dry-erase marker to keep track of the offices instead of more cubes. But you don&#039;t have to get that fancy.

	<body>Speaking of waiting... I have the game for two weeks already, after a waiting for it a few months to be delivered after the succesful kickstarter campain, and I only started to play yesterday. 

With our newborn and our two other young children, I don&#039;t have the time I had to play, and it took me two weeks to scrap a couple minutes here and there to read the rulebook!

So I setup the game a few days ago and I finally started to play last evening around 10PM... And I just had time to do the hero phase of the first round when my newborn daughter woke up. I had to left the game on the table for another couple of days probably. I will certainly finish the game by the end of the month (hopefully by the end of next week)and keep updating this post along the way!

I already know after a few minutes of play that I will probably really like the game.



[imageid=2652187]

Part 2!

i managed to finish my first game tonight. I got to the last location. fengray was pretty beat up and had only two cards in his deck and hand. Arani was in better shape but with the time tracker one case before &quot;the end&quot;, I had one round to beat way too many enemies.

Overall, I love the game even though I had to refer to the rulebook almost every step of each round to be sure to not miss anything. But i&#039;m confident I&#039;ll be able to get away from it pretty quickly as the game is not that complicated once you have a feel for the game.

 :thumbsup: fun game!
:thumbsup: not long too set up and don&#039;t too much table space!
:thumbsdown: feel too mechanical but I don&#039;t think that impression will stick!

My kids are a little older, but I feel the same way! With a hectic schedule, I&#039;ve only played two rounds of the first scenario over the last two weeks.  I just want to sit down and play more!

Yes, I tried to resist then Rahdo&#039;s vid made it look a little like Shadow&#039;s of Brimstone (which I liked the look of and really liked the theme but disliked the look of the dice rolling) and I really liked Forge War and the component and even box quality and I realised....

Absolutely this. I&#039;ve backed this, too, and I&#039;m already in for Kilforth. It&#039;s a shame Rahdo turned Tristan down, as I think the positive effect of the exposure would have been great - even if I spend more time rolling my eyes at his waffle these days. (And he needs to stop naming prototypes as one of the best games of the next year... that&#039;s up there with people rating stuff ten out of ten before playing it. Just a pet peeve of mine.)

I usually look at both ends of the score scale when considering a new game. I think I have eight or nine games I&#039;ve rated 10/10, in a collection upwards of three hundred titles now. I&#039;d stand by every one (today) but I do tweak the list occasionally.

I have nearly 300 games too, but I like to signify my fave games with a 10. I have a few 9.5&#039;s too, which would be equivalent to some of your tens. In fact BGG counts them as tens, because it rounds up.

I tend to ignore the overall BGG scores and just use the analyse option to see what my geekbuddies rate games as, much more meaningful.

Ooooooooooooooooo, very organized!  I love it.  I need to do something similar.  My LOTR:LCG box is so huge, it&#039;s almost overwhelming.  I&#039;ve been debating doing binders instead of a box so I can see (and read) the cards more easily.  Sometimes instead of reading a book before bed, I like to read through my cards.  :D

I haven&#039;t placed the order for binder yet though because it would be SO MANY PAGES.

I can imagine.  Binders would be huge.  I use dividers to organize the game.  I keep the adventures in the original box and the player cards in an expansion box for Thunderstone.  That combination seems to be just the right size for me.

I was very very overwhelmed until I printed out the dividers by Ryno80 and started using them.  I used to use GeckoTHs&#039; divicers before but for some reason didn&#039;t find them very usable even though they look fantastic. Maybe because I printed them out on cardstock and the new ones are mounted on matte board.

Take a look at the Ultra Pro binders if you haven&#039;t already. They come in different colours so you can match the spheres. I use a blue, red, green and purple binder for all the player cards by sphere, sorted by allies/events/attachments in release order. And then a white binder for all the heroes and neutral cards. 

Not exactly a cheap option but I find it great for looking through the cards to build decks. Although because the cards are in binders I only sleeve the deck(s) I&#039;m using now so there&#039;s all the money saved from not sleeving every card!

Yeah after seeing Suzy say what she has for LotR cards in a previous post, I couldn&#039;t imagine how many binders you&#039;d need to store them all and the room it would take. That being said, to be able to read them all easily and find them quickly would benefit greatly. So I see 2 sides to it. Ahhh, useful as always, I am.

I use these vertical dividers: [filepage=103472][/filepage] and they are awesome.  It&#039;s just that I can never find cards quickly.  There are so many cards per divider, when I&#039;m looking for an ally for example, I&#039;m grabbing a huge stack of cards and have to rifle through them all.  I used to organize them within the divider by cost, but after disassembling a few decks, that fell apart.  I feel like with binder, every card has it&#039;s special spot.  So if it&#039;s in its special spot, then I know its in a deck.  Right now, I can&#039;t find Bombur (the one where he counts as two dwarves, lol) and I know it&#039;s somewhere in my giant box, but I&#039;m going to have to sort through everything...  But if I do multiple binders, then (of course) I will organize them by cost, and then when I get a new pack and a new 2-cost card, I&#039;m going to have to reorder the entire binder because I&#039;m insane like that....  Sigh, first world problems...  :D

Edit: I found Bombur. I had forgotten that this particular Bombur is a hero, not ally.

And these 2 sides are what keep bouncing back in forth in my own head, thus rendering me quite useless!  I stare at my LOTR box of cards like a deer in the headlights, LOL.

I got everything out on the table tonight and tried to see how things could fit in binders.  I think it&#039;s too much...the box isn&#039;t perfect, but it slightly better all things considered.  I have to remember that I can always use the Hall of Beorn card search like a &quot;binder&quot; since I own the entire card pool.  It&#039;s searchable which is even better than a binder.

Such a good site, eh? His Path of Beorn is pretty cool. Great for explaining. I saw Cardboard of the Rings did a vid series similar to The Path, but it&#039;s assumed 3 core sets were owned. Good community for this game. I think this is the only LCG where the forums aren&#039;t overrun by jerks... wonder why... maybe it&#039;s the coop (solo :cool: )!?!?!

It really is.  Dan did some upgrades to it earlier this year which allows you to search in so many different ways, it&#039;s great.  I enjoy the deck lists too, especially when I&#039;m feeling too lazy to deckbuild (which is often).  I used Path of Beorn to get started when I first began to play the game.  It was so helpful!  I think a lot of people who get turned off by the game when they first start out is because the core set deck lists are horrible.  Path of Beorn saved me a lot of early frustration!

3 core sets?  Sheesh, I thought I was a little crazy for owning two.  I bought a second set just to get another Hennamarth Riversong, a card I run 2 of in every single deck I own.  He is essential for the pure solo player.  Really wish he wasn&#039;t a Fantasy Flight made-up character, but you can&#039;t have it all.

Yes, awesome community for this game.  Like you, I think it is partly because it&#039;s co-op/solo, but also I think it&#039;s because people who love Tolkien are generally good, wholesome folks.

I finally finished Moria with my dwarven deck.  It did it a bit weird though.  I had done the 1st scenaro, Into the Pit, with my Spirit Lore deck and then made a Dwarven deck after that.  So once I finished the 3rd scenario, I went back and did the first one.  I had a hard time with that one.  My dwarves where just not showing up and I never managed to even explore the East Gate in maybe 3 of the 5 games I played.  But I finally had a good game that went well, albiet slowly.  Gandalf showed up a few times to help out and my steadfast dwarves kept exploring and fighting their way in.  I lost one fighter, a grizzled veteran, of many years, but he helped hold back an orc attack long enough for Gandalf to come in and kill the fiend.

All in all, I&#039;ve really enjoyed Moria. I&#039;ve enjoyed it a lot more than Mirkwood.  That&#039;s a shame, because Mirkwood is probably my favorite location from the Hobbit.

Question: Is is dwarf or dwarve? Dwarfs or dwarves?

You can always count on Gandalf... 

But, to answer your question; Tolkien used the terms Dwarf and Dwarves, however, I&#039;ve seen a number of others use the plural Dwarfs too. Can&#039;t remember ever seeing Dwarve, off the top of my head anyway.

	<body>My 8th play of this recently reacquired game.

The randomiser app picked Absolute Zero, Bunker and the Visionary to take on Baron Blade in Insula Primalis.  I love that about this game - tons of replayability and no need for scenarios to create that.

This was a medium difficulty selection - that&#039;s what I&#039;ve decided to play until I feel totally comfortable with everything.  Also, I tried 3 games at hard difficulty and got my hat handed to me.

Managed to squeak a win by the skin of my teeth.  All 3 of my heroes had 1 HP remaining when Bunker finally finished off the Baron.

This game boggles my mind.  It captures the theme but also delivers a real mental challenge too.  Working out combos (e.g. using a Visionary card to change Baron Blade&#039;s attack to fire so Absolute Zero could do damage or heal himself) and keeping track of everything keeps my brain ticking.

One of the reasons I initially got rid of it (the bookkeeping) is now one of the reasons I want it to stay.  I&#039;ve also chilled out a lot and I&#039;m ok with missing the odd modifier - most can be applied later anyway and if not, over the length of game it usually doesn&#039;t affect the result significantly.

This wasn&#039;t in my [geeklist=189816]Top 20[/geeklist] last year but will almost certainly be this year.  It might even crack my top 10.

It might even beat [thing=129437][/thing] as my favourite super hero game.

I&#039;m now eyeing the expansions for this.... how long can I resist?

:thumbsup: It&#039;s super heroes. 

:thumbsdown: The bookkeeping won&#039;t be for everyone.

:thumbsup::thumbsdown: The art.  All by the same artist but some of the cards look great and some look amateurish.</body>

The bookkeeping is still keeping me away from this one. I love the super hero theme, but watching play throughs has scared me off.

Have you tried the app version? If so, how does it compare?

I haven&#039;t tried the app version but you could dip your toe in with that as it will remove all the need for tracking stuff.

I don&#039;t know if it changes anything from the physical game though.

Gary,

I have [thing=129437][/thing] and SotM. SotM captures the superhero theme and game play much better. Legendary feels like you are playing Dominion with a superhero theme and honestly Dominions theme is just pasted on. Ergo, Legendary&#039;s theme feels pasted on. When I&#039;m playing I don&#039;t really feel like I&#039;m doing much other than trying to build my deck to get the best combo&#039;s I can.

Between the Hero, Villain, and Environment decks in SotM I &quot;feel&quot; like I am trying to fight my way out of Atlantis, Wagner Mars Base, or save Megalopolis.

	<body>Close game with two buys, with New York as my starting deck.  The AI won the first two games, and I thought I was going to lose quickly, but then I won the next three games, then the AI won one and it was a tie - the next game would determine the victory.  I was winning 3 to 0, then, the AI loaded the bases, and on the very last card hit a single, double, and homerun for six runs.  AI 4 games to my 3.  Very intense session.

I lost, but it was challenging and fun.</body>

	<body>The first of my Out of Dust Games this month.  Last played in Jan, so used No Income Bacterial this time... [i]I will escalate to (Overtime Without Pay) Viral soon.[/i]

Won a couple, lost a few.  The worst play was up against it from the start; ended up lasting only 12 rounds.  Checking the cards, they ordered 11 molecules to be added to the C-Ring, throw in few negative dice modifiers and it got to the point where only a natural 6 would prevent the spread of infection.  An unlucky shuffle which could only have been countered with great dice rolls.

Disaster/Threat Management games have come to be a firm favourite of mine, and this has the common elements of one; variable powers (equipment &amp; staff), action points (drawing proteins, with cash restrictions), &#039;bad stuff&#039; (card effect on board and dice) and a timer (infection track) - all with a nice puzzley twist.  However for some reason I am not getting swept up in this game.  

[i]As I like to keep my collection small, more plays are planned, but this game&#039;s place in my collection is under review.[/i]

:thumbsup: Disaster Management-esque in a small footprint.

Mine is collecting dust too.  Played once.  Need to play it a few more times, preferably in close proximity so I remember the rules.  It must have gotten so many raves for a reason, right?  And there was nothing in particular wrong with it.

I bought the game because of its theme - I work in Ebola research.  I have yet to break it open, though.  Some day at lunch I&#039;ll grab it instead of the Sudoku.

I think it depends on how much &quot;bad luck&quot; ruins a game for you: Bad die rolls, multiple nasty mutations in a row, all the &quot;good&quot; lab cards were in the 5 cards discarded at the beginning.

Some interesting commentary there, Scribes. I guess the question I would ask is how much tension do you experience while playing the game. Do your victories feel earned? When you lose, does it feel like a nail-biter finale where you felt if you had just one more turn you could have won? I know that many of my games felt like they came down to cliff hanger.

I&#039;m actually looking forward to trying it out.  Just not quite up to getting over the hump of reading the rules. :)

	<body>And I figure the first game that I really want to post about was of course my game: Everything vs. Everything. Haven&#039;t played it in about a month or so but it still remains exactly the game that I want it to be. I personally always play with the difficulty at its highest, but instead of 4 cards in each drafting deck, I use 6 cards. The game is at its best with all of its crazy combos and 6 cards gives you the best options.

-------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to play a more traditional game so I chose to play against an Attack/Boost Director. I did of course choose my characters accordingly. 

My characters were The Joker, Macross, The Zerg, Optimus Prime, Kirby, and the Alien Queen as my spare. Since the Director is going to come out swinging, my strategy was to use the Directors tactics against him. Having Macross deflect damage back and swapping the Joker to steal an opposing character that was getting to powerful was the key. The Zerg&#039;s rush tactic that just attacks each turn helps, and Optimus Prime is great at boosting. Plus Kirby is just plain flexible.

Key problem with my strategy is picking the Energy Cards. I wasn&#039;t sure what my proper proportions were, so I went with 7 hearts, 7 clubs, and 6 spades.

Other weaknesses include no card changers, healers, draw extra cards, or spades in my deck (so Macross can&#039;t even attack normal). 

The Director started with Boba Fett, Swiper the Fox, The EMH Doctor from Star Trek Voyager, The Borg, and Danger Mouse. Yep, this game is always interesting.

[imageid=2652777 large]

First Turn: I get lucky with the directors first card as it cannot actually do anything to me! Yay. Of course, my first draw is just as spectacular. I do actually use the Joker&#039;s first attack ability against Boba Fett even though it is expensive so that the EMH director doesn&#039;t get a chance to fully heal him to 18 health.

Second turn: The Zerg continues to whittle away at both himself and the EMH doctor. Boba Fett deals a devastating blow to the Joker. I should probably get rid of him before he gets completely wiped out. SO I do. I grab the Borg and the Director gets my Joker. Can`t actually attack with the Joker, so he is now a meat shield.

Third Turn: The EMH Doctor gets a bazooka&#039;s worth of damage in boost tokens. I think that Macross needs to go against him. Yep, I do. So I do. 

Turn Four: First elimination: The Zerg takes out the Joker. Yep, his ability does feel like a true Zerg rush. Of course, he is going to kill himself as the game goes on, but it is still pretty cool to see it played out. Swiper continues to suck as a character. And the first new director character: Aerith Gainsborough from Final Fantasy 7. Still no Uber Director cards yet. 

Turn Five: Swiper gets some useless boost tokens, Aerith gets some useful boost tokens. I do a little damage to Swiper. Still waiting for the big attack!

[imageid=2652780 large]

Turn 6: In one of those weird timing effects of cards, The EMH doctor attacks Macross, but the Macross redirects the damage to Boba Fett, killing him. But this works right before the EMH Doctor can fully heal Boba Fett. This works because you enact each action on the card before moving on the the next action on the card. Oddly enough, this leave me without that much to do on my turn because my best attacking character, Kirby, gets stuck with a non attacking ability if he attacks something that cannot attack back. In other words, Swiper continues to swipe. And attacking Aerith is tricky to because her ability helps the director way more than it helps me.

Turn 7: Gypsy Danger gets pulled into the fold! He is one heavy hitter. Yikes! I use Optimus prime to Move things around a bit because Aerith Gainsborough does some major healing if she dies. So instead, the Zerg can take out Swiper. (I wonder if they would turn him into thier Zerg Queen? Owww man.)

Turn 8: Swiper dies. Aerith attacks. Macross redirects damage to EMH director. Then Optimus Prime attacks the EMH Doctor, killing him. Good thing too, he had 12 boost tokens. At the end of my turn, I sub in the Alien Queen for about to die Zerg. May as well use them if I can.

Turn 9: First Uber card. Was wondering where they were. And it is the major attack card. Gipsy Danger does major damage to my Borg. The Terminator comes into the game. Aerith Gainsborough&#039;s damage is redircted to Gipsy Danger, and Danger Mouse continues to do nothing because his attack is so wierd. I cannot respond due to not having enough clubs in my hand so I cannot do anything.

Turn 10: Another attack by the Director. He does a lot of damage, but it isn&#039;t enough.

[imageid=2652781 large]

End game score:

Director: 33
Me: 62

Knowing what you are going up against is a huge advantage in this game. Every strategy has a counter strategy. By design. But if you like to play a game that lets you do something clever, this is your game!

	<body>It&#039;s here! The WAIT is finally over! I think I was relatively late to come across this game but after becoming aware, the 2-3 months of WAITING for it to arrive on these shores felt unbearable. Usually I&#039;ll have a good read of the rule book before I do anything else, but tonight I just punched the counters, set it up and played through the illustrated example of play. All that&#039;s done is whet my appetite and I can&#039;t WAIT to play against the bots tomorrow night. It feels like it&#039;s going to be an amazing experience. </body>

Enjoy the game! I&#039;m major jealous.

I&#039;ve just heard that my copy of the game (ordered via a well-known German distributor of GMT&#039;s games) will be arriving somewhere toward the end of September.

Let me just make clear that [i]I&#039;m not blaming the distributor[/i]. From what I understand of how this stuff works, it is due to a combination of bad luck and the realities of a difficult business climate in which this niche hobby of ours operates that&#039;s caused this delay in this particular case. It&#039;s frustrating nonetheless.

I really do not agree about your distributor. GMT, VP Games etc have a TERRIBLE official distribution over in EU. 

I am not speaking about the 2 well known German website shops, but all the rest is simply 2-3 months late on the matter.

It is ridiculous but even Wing Leader that was shipped in early July is still not available in shops that work with the official channels.

Chances are that the moment Churchill will be &quot;distributed&quot; to the normal EU shops, in 2/3 copies, GMT will run out and you have exactly a few days window before it is no longer available. It happened to Unconditional Surrender and lots of other games (Coin series etc...).

All that talk are simply excuses for not following the GMT or wargaming market closely. Period. These excuses are lame and is simply a direct result of sloppiness and non interest in supporting wargames. They sell a million XWing, so they are not even aware of &quot;another Wing&quot; game.

Individual shops can often import these things MONTHS before the distributor does, so it is quite clear where the hic up up is made.

	<body>I broke out Castaways today. I was really exited to play this because I&#039;ve enjoyed it so much in the past. I set it up and reread the rules. I probably could have legged it out without reading the rules, but I&#039;m really glad I did because I had played it solo before. This time, however, I decided to play with three characters, instead of one, and the rules are slightly different when playing with multiple characters. 

I won! So that was really satisfying because the game is crushingly hard with only one character. In fact, I found the game really easy this time around. I won with five rounds left in the game. Only one of my castaways had a trauma and only one of them had any injuries. In the solo game, my characters had died from too many traumas. It felt like an easy stroll across the island while I waited to be rescued. 

Despite the ease of the victory, the game took me three hours to play. It was so long! The time at least doubled with the two extra characters. I found that to be quite a disappointment. This game is relatively easy and a lot of it is like a choose your adventure book. So, the difficulty to length ratio seemed to be off by quite a bit. That&#039;s something I&#039;m starting to pay attention to. Games that are long should be more complicated, in my opinion. You know, [thing=96848]Mage Knight[/thing] takes 3 hours, but the depth and complexity make the time feel well spent. However, I wouldn&#039;t want to spend 3 hours playing a single game of [thing=142854]Infection[/thing]. Castaways feels like it should be an hour-and-a-half kind of game.

But I won, and that was really satisfying. I made a couple of mistakes but that&#039;s because I find it easy to mix up the [i]supply[/i] and the [i] storage[/i]. Here&#039;s my guys at the end. They&#039;re hungry and tired, but little worse for wear. 

[center][ImageID=2651842medium][/center]

[b]Edit:[/b]
I played two more games of this today.  I played one with two players and the other with three players.  Like Kevin said below, the game is crushingly hard with only one player.  I might even say unbeatable.  With two, it feels like a desperate attempt at survival. With three, things run along really smoothly and I find it pretty easy to stay alive.  With four, I would imagine that you will have more people than you know what to do with.  

I lost both games.  In the first game, I had the necessary requirements to flag a passing ship but I couldn&#039;t make it to the top of the mountain.  In the second game, I never really got the things I needed to signal the ship.  However, we had a bunch of wood and food, a goat, and we had built a house back in camp. So, the three of us would happily spend our days, in relative safety an comfort on the island.

[center][ImageID=2654113medium][/center]

This is a good game, and I quite enjoyed it.  However, I think my time with this game is done.  I am working really hard to [b][geeklist=194076]explore my collection[/geeklist][/b], and I am finding that means I need to get rid of games.  So, Castaways is off to the trading post.</body>

Hi Al, I&#039;m not sure I can make the best comparison.  I&#039;ve only played one game of RC and it was a bunch of months ago.  I never really got a feel for the game in my one learning play.  However, I will do my best to compare the too.

Castaways is a medium-weight game, maybe along the lines of Ticket to Ride: Marklin (it&#039;s the most complicated of the TTRs).  RC is a much heavier game.  They both are worker placement games.  And, of course, they are both about being stranded on a island.  In both games you are trying to survive, you need to find food, build shelter, and explore. However, I would say they are accomplished in different ways.

Castaways only has one scenario, so to speak, where RC has a bunch of different scenarios.  Castaways has a choose-your-own-adventure type card deck which creates variability, but every game is the same basic structure.  In RC, it&#039;s my understanding that each scenario gives the player a different way to play.

In Castaways, there are two parts of the game.  First is the worker placement half.  In this, you are gathering wood, finding food, building shelter, keeping your fire lit, finding wreckage from your ship, building a &quot;help&quot; sign in the sand, that kind of thing.  It&#039;s the survival half of the game.  The second half is the exploration of the island phase.  

In the exploration portion, you leave the worker placement board and go off into the island and explore. There are three decks of cards, one for the coast, inland, and heart of the island.  As you explore, you draw cards from these decks.  It will often give you options and prompt you to get certain cards from the choose-your-own-adventure-style deck.  These new cards can be anything.  New events, new challenges, new equipment, a dog.  Here&#039;s an example.  There is a card that says you find a native woman running through the jungle trying to escape from the savages.  You can help her, help the savages, or ignore her.  This takes place during the inland portion of your exploration, and depending on what you do, you will take a card and shuffle it into the heart of the island deck.  I chose to help her, and because I did, I discovered they were cannibals later on in the game.  If I would have fought them, I&#039;m sure I would have learned something different.  

So, there is a very big story element to this game that isn&#039;t in RC.  However, I still think RC creates a strong story as well, it&#039;s just doesn&#039;t have an entire portion of the game dedicated to the story.  In Castaways, you stop the worker placement part of the game and start the exploration phase.  It&#039;s almost like it&#039;s two games in one.  With that said, however, the two halves flow together seamlessly.

I hope this helps.

It seems like a game I&#039;d enjoy, might even add it to my wish list !

I&#039;ll even use the two games in one, to suggest to the other half it&#039;s a bargain :)

Ryan summarized it well. 

I&#039;ll add one warning to those of you who always insist on playing solo with 1 character. Castaways makes this extremely difficult. One bad roll while exploring and your lost and the fire on the island goes out. Once that happens, you&#039;re seriously in trouble. In fact, I find it quite unlikely that you&#039;ll win.

I think this game is a fun story waiting to be shared by multiple people.

It seems like a game I&#039;d enjoy, might even add it to my wish list !

I&#039;ll even use the two games in one, to suggest to the other half it&#039;s a bargain :) [/q]

Castaways is no longer in my collection.  RC is, and is never leaving. 

The concept of Castaways was good--I liked the exploration.  A lot. There was so much that could be done with the story cards.  But it didn&#039;t come together for me.  The game took far too long to play both solo and multiplayer.  What should have played in 90 minutes often took twice that time.  In addition, you&#039;re doing all the same actions every game for the same reasons, and it felt repetitive.  In RC, though the actions stay the same, the reasons for doing them differ quite a lot, which to me, make the game great.

I also found you had to play with more than 1 character to have any chance of winning.

	<body>A lovely play of the solo variant on BGG tonight ended up with me besting the archmage 186 to 132. 

One of the funny things about this game is that I was never drawn to it, because the box made it look &quot;childish&quot; to me (funny because I love the artwork in the game).  I watched a video of it when I was bored one summer night last year and thought it looked decent. I ended up getting the game with the expansions for a good price.  This is likely one of my top 10 overall games in my collection because of the ease of play, quick setup / teardown, nice depth to gameplay and good decisions during the game.

The solo variant does a decent job at providing enough challenge to play it when you don&#039;t have someone else, but the drafting is a little lacking vs. the multiplayer game.</body>

	<body>I headed to the depths of the dungeon tonight, and decided to shuffle ALL the expansion cards together, and randomly select my adventurers. Early on in the game I was avoiding trap after trap, (I got a mental visual of DungeonQuest) and then I started to hit some nasty monsters.  The thing is, when I was playing it I royally messed up a rule and realized it about 30 cards into the 80 card game, so I had to end it early.  Now I&#039;m back online and going to watch a video of it before I give it another go tonight or tomorrow morning.

This goes to show that I need to play the games that I get pretty frequently before shelving them for a month or two so that the rules set in.  This game specifically takes a lot of &quot;head space&quot; to not only wrap your arms around the rules, but to play it well. 

Back to the drawing board.

On an unrelated note, I decided to get back into RPG games that I haven&#039;t touched in over 20 years, so I imagine that my board game playing time will start to diminish.  That said, I&#039;m specially trying to develop a solo system for the Warhammer series of games as I was inspired by the monthly solo RPG game listing.  I have some interesting ideas, so I&#039;m starting with Deathwatch and will take it from there.</body>

	<body>[thing=68820][/thing] German Solo. 

Despite really slow advances (or none at all) for 6th Panzer Army and 7th Army until the 20th, the 5th Panzer toke Bastogne on the 16th and created a big gap on the Allied lines that cost them some days to fill.

Then an operational pause in the Center and all resources to break from North and South. Big losses for the various Allied Corps.

The 24th Peiper reached Liege but didn&#039;t cross the Meuse, the XXX Corps was garrisoning the city. That left him out of supply, so the OKW reserves were still retained. The 25th ended with an Operational Victory due to allied losses and key cities captured (57 VPs).

[ImageID=2653368]

Allied Losses: 
- Entire V Corps (5 Divs) is eliminated (save 1 unit surrounded)
- Half VII Corps (2 Divs)
- 1/3rd XVIII Corps (4 Divs shattered)
- Half XII Corps (2 Divs)
- Half VIII Corps (2 Divs)

Here the Half North and Half South:

:thumbsup:The AI is not perfect but it&#039;s enough challenging to keep playing it. It&#039;s a good substitute for a human player with so little trouble, and accomplishing it only with some cards and few play aids (and integrating it with the map and the unit selector number) is a feat. Congratulations to John.

:thumbsup:I&#039;ve enjoyed all the days it was on the table, and left me always pondering over my decisions and next moves when not at home. 

:thumbsdown:I&#039;m not sure now if replaying again the German Solo or try the Allied Solo. It&#039;s a difficult decision because I had the table fully busy with this game last month, and I can&#039;t play any other!!! :cry:  Well, I must confess I prefer to keep playing this one (Peleliu should wait) :D</body>

Glad to see you posting here, Edgar :)

This game is really dense. I still have problems to internalize some details and I&#039;m confronted to rules&#039; mistakes [despite your excellent[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/120735/eaa-german-solo-booklet] GS solo booklet[/url], thank you for it] from time to time. I don&#039;t know why, because, it&#039;s overall pretty logical as in any Butterfield&#039;s game.

Unfortunately, I need so much time to play a full campaign, I had to give up for a while, and play some lighter games. It will have to wait for the next vacation... but I&#039;m sure I will come back to it.

Anyway, I understand you can spend hours away from the game, thinking about your next moves. It is the closest feeling I had to a real opponent; although, I rarely play wargames against real human...

I rarely post in forums, but SGOYT has so many nice people and full of really good information about games (likes and dislikes) that I had to share too :)

The game plays fast (if you consider fast to spend some evenings) once you get the rules and play the game and not the system. But you need space and time, and it&#039;s true that you can do multiple plays with lighter games, but there are few that get me thinking on it like this one.

Hope you get some time to complete a campaign, it&#039;s a good experience. I can play wargames face to face every 1-2 months, more or less, but this is a nice substitute!

	<body>Let&#039;s just get this out there.  [b]I love this game.[/b]

I have to thank [b][user=woelf]Kyle[/user] [/b]for bringing it to my attention.  A non solo game that he has created a super simple solo variant for that works brilliantly.

I have only played it 6 times but each one of those games has been excellent.  Each game has been different and it truly captures the theme. 

In this play I was Captain Bruce Nicholson (of no fixed abode) and his stats made a pirate strategy the obvious choice.

This worked really well and I even got a Glory card that allowed me to remove all my bounties (5 at that time) by paying gold so I could start from scratch again.  I completed a mission, 3 rumours and upgraded my ship to a Frigate so I reached 10 Glory points with 2 turns left (the solo variant has 15 turns) and was victorious.

[ImageID=2653617 medium]Crikey! That&#039;s a lot of boats.

Or so I thought.  I then realised I hadn&#039;t made an influence roll for 2 of my rumours. :shake:  My brain must have been thinking about something else (West Ham winning at Anfield in the league for the first time since 1963 possibly - the year before my parents met!).

Anyway, I did the two influence rolls and only succeeded at one so I took off a Glory point and discarded a Glory card.

I now had 2 turns to get 1 point.  I tried twice to take down a pirate Sloop but failed.  I damaged it badly but it successfully fled both times.

My last chance was to try and take down a merchant and get 12 gold from the raid.  I was able to add a fourth cargo card to the haul and this gave me 14 gold and a Glory point. VICTORY (for real this time).

Anyway, this will definitely make my [geeklist=189816]Top 20[/geeklist] when the People&#039;s Choice Top 100 rolls around.  I have a feeling it may even be in my Top 5.

It may also have made [b][thing=95103][/thing][/b] redundant.  This is easier to set up, the rules are much simpler and it delivers an experience just as thematic.  I will have to play that again to compare properly but right now I know which one I would choose to take to a desert island.

:thumbsup: Theme, components, ruleset, challenge.  All of these are spot on.

:thumbsdown: The luck of the dice and movement of the NPCs can sometimes destroy you.</body>

Sadly, I shall have to wait awhile.
A couple other games are in the monetary way currently. (CoH solo expansion and Dawn of the Zeds)
But, I am definitely sold on M&amp;M, now. Specially after I checked the boardsize, which will fit just right on my table. [i]It&#039;s like it was meant to be.[/i] heh heh

The telephone rang.  Super Dad and Sick Boy ran to answer.

&quot;Super Dad, Sick Boy!  We&#039;ve just had reports that Dr Doom and his Doombot Legion have stolen Mole Man&#039;s Massive Earthquake Generator and has set it up in Donegal.  He&#039;s trying to get it on-line right now.  You know what to do. And be quick about it!&quot;

&quot;We&#039;re on it, Chief.&quot;

SB &amp; SD gathered the most trustworthy SHIELD agents they could.  &quot;Okay people, we need heroes and we need them now.  You!  See who&#039;s available.  You!  There are some shenanigans going down on Front Street, see what&#039;s occuring.&quot;

Reports soon filtered back that the Sinister Six and Maximum Carnage were creating havoc to divert attention from the Generator.  Fortunately Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thing, Thor and Captain America had answered the call.

Despite losing a few good agents to some early earthquake fissures and some very scary Maximum Carnage feasting the dream team were starting to fire on all cylinders.  With some cool moves and great planning Doombots were sent flying in a hail of electric sparks, Shriek was silenced, Sandman was blasted and Vulture&#039;s were plucked out of the sky.

Spider-Man turned Kraven the Hunter into the hunted and Thing, Thor and Captain America pulled off the final attack that captured Dr D and pulled the plug on the generator.

Super Dad and Sick Boy thanked everyone and sat down with a nice biscuit and a cup of tea.

The Hills of Donegal were safe once again.

Thanks, glad you liked it.  Local band but a national hit, it&#039;s a real party song and was modern about 20 years ago!  The philosophy behind the song comes from the fact Donegal was, in the bad old days, very cut off from the rest of the country being almost surrounded by the North.  Things were very different here compared to the other 25 counties - almost neither one side of the border nor the other.  So why not play on that &#039;otherness&#039; and create your own wonderland?  And like you say, it&#039;s a jaunty tune.

Two losses in a row.  This one felt like a straight up beat-down.  After playing this movie again I am happy I watched it too.  It helps with the theme of this deck which is about brotherhood and sacrifice.  If the CGI of that move wasn&#039;t done so poorly it might have been an OK movie.  I cringed every time I saw the alien.

I think this might be the 3rd time playing this movie.  And it shows.  I&#039;m not quite sure the best ways to construct and use this deck.  But that&#039;s part of the fun of course.  This was a tense game.  By the middle of the second objective, I would have at least one alien in the combat zone.  What made it worse is the facehuggers inserted into the barracks.  When those appear they get the most focus.  So instead of taking out aliens in the combat zone I had to kill the facehuggers and then start drawing strikes.  Early on in the third objective the Beast (final enemy) appeared in the combat zone.  It was soon followed by Michael Weyland who instead of making you draw a strike, he puts a chestburster into you discard pile.  When you get around to drawing this card you are dead.  He was in the combat zone and I needed 7 attack to kill him.  I had 6 :(  Basically my turns were now numbered.  A few turns later I had a gaming moment I&#039;ll remember for a while.  I drew and played &quot;Internal Exam&quot; card and was able to discard the chestbuster.  Yes, I was punching air...

Well, it didn&#039;t really matter anyway.  I was able to hold off for a few more rounds but ultimately the aliens had their way.  I&#039;m sure both characters are now either ripped apart or are now hosts to a baby alien.

:star: This game is just so tense.  It is not a way for me to sit down and relax :)  The only other game that has this affect on me is [thing=144568][/thing]

[b]Game:[/b] 2/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b]1 Drone in objective 2, 2 drones in objective 3.
[b]Two Handed[/b]
Now this was a fun session!  I focused primarily on picking up cards that could kill other cards (deck thinning).  It worked out very well.  There were times where situations were a little uncomfortable.  But that didn&#039;t deter my strategy.  At the end of the game one hand had 11 cards and the other 16.  I had no issue generating the attack I needed throughout the third objective.  I got you this time Beast!!!

[b]Game:[/b] 3/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b]0 Drones
[b]Two Handed[/b]
Got my groove back with my 2nd win in a row.  I played with 0 drones this time to amp up the difficulty.  No problem, I was able to continue my previous strategies of thinning my decks early.  The HQ stayed full of great cards and I had no issue taking out the Beast.

How about now?
Strange.  Google must have changed something.  I usually just view my photos in the google photo gallery.  Right-click and copy image URL and use that link.  The links are now MUCH longer and not shareable.  So now it appears I have to view the image, create a sharable link, use that link, click the image, right-click and copy image URL.

	<body>[size=18][b]The Waiting Game[/b][/size]

I preordered this back in 12/31/13.
Been waiting patiently....well there have been a few complaints, but still waiting...waiting...

Then I realized in all that time my credit card had probably expired.
So, I gave [company=7747][/company] a call to check.

Sure enough, CC had expired. New one in hand, CoH is now on the way!
It should arrive just in time for[b] Joshcon 2015![/b]

Academy was super great to deal with. I had my complaints before, like when I got Spanish hit counters for [thing=132028][/thing], but they sent me the English ones, as soon as they could.

Really excited now. :D
And quite happy with dealing with [company=7747][/company]. They have been quite friendly and really helpful.</body>

When I got my first copy, they had Spanish Counters as well.  My wife teaches Spanish to K-6 students, so I joked with her that she obviously has to play this game with me.  She didn&#039;t feel the same way.

Uwe and Co are simply great, super high quality releases where it seems like financial profit is a bonus incentive but not the key driving factor for the company&#039;s existence. Some other publishers feel this way too (DVG comes instantly to mind) but they&#039;re precious and few and they all have a different take on what they consider a quality product, making each of them unique (regarding Academy, it&#039;s streamlined rules with rock solid and beautiful components. Heck, even the cubes in 1812/1775 look beautiful when in the context of the board). At the end of the day, though, they want their customers to feel like they got a great game on their hands.

Can&#039;t wait to get this one!

Agreed!

DVG came through for me in a flash too, when I was missing counters.
Both them and Academy have incredible quality.

It will be a battle for best game of 2015 between this and [thing=160418][/thing]

	<body>I was intending to play [thing=146652][/thing], which I received yesterday, but due to the bitter disappointment of finding that there were 47 cards missing, had to find something else to play.

So, back to this.

I decided to go back to the Barbarians and this time include the extra cards from the [thing=169075][/thing] expansion ([i]sans[/i] the Open Production and Volcano cards). I used the new VP card and played against the Romans.

This game was a race to the finish, with me trying to find enough Faction cards on the table to stay ahead of the VP, which I managed to achieve at the end, by having 13 cards to the VP&#039;s 12.

A win against the Roman VP, scoring 28 for locations and 27 extras for a &#039;could have gone better&#039; 55 points.</body>

That&#039;s a shame about Legendary Encounters but you aren&#039;t the first to say that.

The way the cards have to be sorted is also rubbish even if you get all the cards in the box.

The set had cards which are usable for each faction, and has the extra cards for the Virtual player, so you can solo against &#039;Romans&#039; and &#039;Barbarians&#039;. I have only played one game against one of these cards as shown above, but it certainly added to the tension.

I&#039;m not sure just how much it adds for the cost, though.

	<body>Sologameapalooza has begun!  And what a way to start....

I did it!  I finally beat the Watcher in the Water!  Epic details here: [listitem=4114069][/listitem]

Last night, I took the time to organize all my card and put together sideboards for each of my decks.  This is essential, I think, if you want to use a thematic deck (dwarves, elves, etc) for multiple quests.  I find that I&#039;m much more successful when I deckbuild specifically for a quest, but I don&#039;t always find that enjoyable - meaning, I would rather be playing a thematic deck with my favorite characters than just play to win.  With a sideboard, I can have it both ways.  I have a core set of cards to each thematic deck that are always in that deck.  Then I can swap out the less-thematically-important-to-me cards with cards in the sideboard that are still thematically relevant, but can give the deck what it needs for a certain quest.  So, I have my dwarf deck, and then this huge stack of &quot;dwarf&quot; trait (or somehow dwarf related) cards.  My allies and weapons are almost always the same, but the event cards are what I most often switch up depending on the quest.  </body>

	<body>5 more plays today - which completes 1 of my planned 3x10 Out of Dust for this month.

Today was more Disaster than Management; whilst it was &#039;No Income Bacterial&#039; again it was with Variant: Tightening the Belt, so only $10 to start.

[i]Disaster[/i] - apart from the 5/5 losses; in the first game; the homogenizer (1 protein covers 2 spaces on the same molecule) was the first purchase after an early destruction of a matching pair of molecules.  However after it&#039;s purchase it failed to work every turn until an event card removed it from the game. :devil:
[i]Management[/i] - meant often buying only the cheap proteins, and needing to destroy a molecule (or two) before being able to buy cards.

[q=Gedin]How much tension do you experience while playing the game. Do your victories feel earned? When you lose, does it feel like a nail-biter finale where you felt if you had just one more turn you could have won? I know that many of my games felt like they came down to cliff hanger.[/q]
3 of the games were nail-biter end-games; plenty of molecules were solved as the &#039;Add to X&#039; rarely swapped out the partial builds. However in each the Containment Phase ran out before I could assemble the last solution.  Yet I was not feeling the tension, just &#039;Dice Hate Me&#039; as rolls would be fails beyond the help of Plus 1 modifiers.

Part of the problem with these recent plays (I now realise) is a missed rule; I have not discarded a Lab card during clean-up if nothing was bought, so have been stuck with a bad selection - and with limited funds saw no way to get better cards.

[i]I have plans for yet more plays before year end, and for 50 plays before a decision is made - so time enough to play correctly.[/i]</body>

Have you tried the Overtime without Pay variant on the Viral side yet? It can help mitigate bad luck from die rolls.I suggest not using it with tightening the belt! That&#039;s just insane! :zombie:

	<body>I just received my trade today and was super excited to open this up and give it a play 2-handed.  Immediately I felt at home with the gameplay because of my past with Magic the Gathering, but my resurgence into the world of Warhammer has gathered steam over the past few weeks and I&#039;m loving every minute of it.

I&#039;m going to play a few more times before seeking out any solo AI options for this</body>

	<body>Now, I definitely wouldn&#039;t consider myself a wargamer, but there are certainly some &quot;war&quot; games that I enjoy.  With that in mind, I recently acquired [thing=28829][/thing] in the latest Canadian Math Trade and had a chance to peruse the rulebook during some downtime at work today.  With the house to myself tonight, I figured it would be a good chance to break this one open and give it a shot.

I decided to try out the shorter Ghost Division campaign.  Setup was a breeze and I was up and playing in just minutes.  I quickly rushed forward, moving the troops into Dinant and then Reims, in hopes of putting a dent in the Allied forces, but they quickly bounced back with more reinforcements popping up in Paris.  Unable to manage his supplies, Rommel was quickly vanquished by the first week of June as the Allies held strong in Cambrai.

Overall, though I suffered a ridiculously quick defeat, this game seems quite fun.  It plays quick (at least when you lose as quick as I do) and setup/take-down is quite minimal, so I can see it getting to the table a lot in the next coming weeks.  I can&#039;t wait to give this one another shot.


:thumbsup: The rulebook was quite simple to follow and nicely laid out for quick referencing.  It didn&#039;t take long to get a good feel for the flow of the game.

:thumbsup: The chit-pull mechanism is great and gives you lots to think about when launching an attack.

:thumbsup: I only have a few games with counters and hell will freeze over before you ever see me clipping, but these counters seemed to be very high quality (and pre-clipped? or is that just my used copy?)

:thumbsdown: The paper maps, though durable for &quot;paper&quot;, are still paper.  I really would have liked to see a mounted maps, but I wouldn&#039;t have shelled out for the deluxe version... oh well.  A big positive is that they are very nicely laid out and all the charts/boxes for each campaign are right there for reference on the map.

Possible :thumbsdown:? Only 3 maps with no variable setup makes me wonder what the replay value actually is.  On the plus side, this game seems punishingly difficult (so that will certainly get me playing over and over).</body>

Great! One more Rommel player. :thumbsup: I wonder how long it will take you to your first win. ;) Took me 7 plays for the Ghost Divison map and still have to beat Africa. Still no win after 9 plays...

It&#039;s probably the toughest scenario. It&#039;s a careful balance of moving forward but not getting overwhelmed. You definitely can&#039;t bunker down.

I played a randomized game of Legendary with the Golden Solo Ruleset. I thought I would try out my new challenge cards to increase the challenge a bit and pulled the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; Challenge, requiring to play two villains at once. I&#039;ve played a few games using the golden solo ruleset but turns out i was supposed to be pulling 2 villain cards all along according to the ruleset. 

Here is the randomized scenario I played:

Mastermind: Carnage
Scheme: Master of Tyrants (with doom, sinister, zombie green goblin added to the villain deck)

Villain Deck:
Streets of New York
Maximum Carnage
Doombot Henchmen

Hero Deck:
Apocalyptic Kitty Pryde
Rogue
Old Man Logan
Ghost Rider
Colossus

Results: Heroes won (72 points)

I had a hard time getting started. The lose condition of the scheme was 5 masterminds escaping. I had 4 Masterminds in the escaped pile. One more and I lose. I couldn&#039;t keep any good cards in my deck as Maximum Carnage and Doombots kept feasting/KOing them. I thought I was surely doomed but at the last ditch effort I was able to get some breathing room. I  set up a good combo with Ghost rider, and Rogue&#039;s strength cards and scrounged up enough damage to knock out 2 slots in the city. This bought me some breathing room and i was able to start punching Carnage. I finally won in the knick of time as the Zombie Green Goblin, the 5th mastermind card, was about to escape.

[imageid=2654518]

Between Feast and Doombots I only had 13 cards in my deck at the end of the game. I had KOed 22 cards from my hero deck and 4 from my victory pile to feed Ghost Rider&#039;s Blazing Hellfire.

Kitty Pryde and Old Man Logan didn&#039;t do much for this set up. No other heroes had tech cards to combo with kitty. Old Man Logan relied on other players. Both also relied heavily on KOing heroes which I really couldn&#039;t afford.

This was probably the hardest game I&#039;ve played of legendary yet. I&#039;ll still have to wait and try my challenge cards again soon for an extra boost of difficulty.</body>

	<body>So it has been a while since I last played this amazing game. Tonight I was inspired by the recent release of a user-made cooperative campaign! Amazing stuff. Five story arcs that mix together as you fight off the empire in a remote section of the galaxy. Pilots that level up! 

Instead of using the standard squad building, you start with a newbie pilot and, through successful missions, gain experience which allows you to buy upgrades and skills. The campaign rules really open up the experience, slowly letting you accumulate upgrades and multiple elite pilot skills and modifications (in the regular game you can have only one elite pilot skill and one modification). You start in an x or y-wing but can spend experience to upgrade to a b-wing, a-wing or Hawk.

It also has new terrain (Ion clouds, minefields, SPACE STATIONS!), and an AI system for the empire&#039;s ships that is based on the web app that so many of us use ([url]http://xwing.runbam.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/[/url]) but has been tweeked to allow for formation flying and swerving around obstacles. The AI charts are printed on cards and enemy movement is resolved with a d6.

Amazing work, and beautifully designed too. You can find it here:

[url]http://dockingbay416.com/campaign/[/url]

The only downside is that to run a full campaign you will need a lot of ships (especially Tie Fighters!). Luckily I have a bit of an obscene collection.

Played the introductory mission tonight (no new terrain needed so I just used the pdf on my computer to display the AI charts). My two pilots had to survive ten rounds, distracting the empire while the rest of the rebels jumped into hyperspace to reach our secret base.

My two pilots were Kelarin Undea in an x-wing with an R7T1 droid (which gives you an action to target lock and boost if you end up in an enemy firing arc) and Sha Senn in an x-wing with an R5P9 droid (let&#039;s you spend a focus token at the end of combat to regain a lost shield).

Names generated by the Star Wars Random Name Generator, found here:

[url]http://www.dimfuture.net/starwars/random/generate.php[/url]

As Kelarin (#1) and Sha (#2) head into the asteroid field, they spot three tie fighters approaching.

[imageid=2654533 large]

Turn 1:

The two rookie pilots squeeze through the asteroids and prepare to engage the enemy.

[imageid=2654537 large]

Turn 2:

While Kelarin shoots past the pair of ties to the left, hoping she can turn in behind them, Sha fires at the third tie but misses.

[imageid=2654555 large]

Turn 3:

Sha flies past the lone tie and engages the pair of ties as they curve around the asteroid, damaging the lead ship. Kelarin turns and takes a long-distance shot at the lone tie and scores a hit!

[imageid=2654538 large]

Turn 4:

As the two x-wings turn to reposition themselves, a tie interceptor joins the battle!

[imageid=2654539 large]

Turn 5:

Kelarin turns in behind the interceptor and manages to blast one of the ties out of the sky. The destroyed tie&#039;s partner manages to seriously damage Kelarin&#039;s ship. 

[imageid=2654540 large]

Turn 6:

As Kelarin finds herself with an interceptor close on her tail, Sha swings back towards the centre of the asteroid field, hoping she can take out the damaged tie and start to even the odds.

[imageid=2654546 large]

Turn 7:

Kelarin pulls a k-turn and ends up face to face with the interceptor, too close for either one of them to shoot. Unfortunately another tie fighter has entered the asteroid field and it scores a hit. Things are critical! Meanwhile Sha manages to further damage one of the other ties, but it barrel rolls to get her in its sights and fires! A hit!

[imageid=2654550 large]

Turn 8:

Kelarin flies at top speed towards the tie that is closing on Sha, hoping to take it out before it can cause more damage. Unfortunately the nimble interceptor makes a sharp turn and boosts in behind her to take a fatal shot. Kelarin is lost!

[imageid=2654551 large]

Turn 9:

Sha only needs to survive this turn and the next to allow the Rebel Transport to launch into hyperspace. She k-turns in behind a tie, but the deadly interceptor gets her in his arc. Game over, the rebels have lost this sector!

[imageid=2654557 large]

After playing the intro scenario, I am definitely printing this whole thing out tomorrow. Can&#039;t wait to dive in! I have flown as the empire in most of my games, so it is exciting to me to be playing the rebels for once. 

By the way, the asteroids in the pictures were made from BBQ lava rocks (you can get a bag of 100s for $7-8 at a hardware store). Primed, painted, drybrushed and a small hole drilled in them to insert the pegs. The acrylic tokens are from Litko (love them), you can find them here:

[url]http://www.litko.net/categories/Supported-Board-Games/Star-Wars-X-Wing/[/url]

:star: Cooperative campaign!
:star: Minor tweaks to the existing AI charts make a huge difference to the deadliness of the empire&#039;s ships
:star: A ton of gameplay from a free download
:star: Missions all scale to the number of rebel ships in play
:star: I know the guy that created this and he has playtested it for close to a year at a bunch of different player/rebel-ship counts
:nostar: Need to print and cut out a bunch of cards and terrain
:nostar: You need a lot of ships to play the full campaign (however, if your collection is limited, playing with a single rebel ship reduces the number of enemy ships necessary. You can also substitute ships that you do have for ships that you don&#039;t).</body>

Awesome session report byReverend.  This game has been collecting dust in my collection for two years now and I came close to selling it a number of times.  Thanks for the inspiration.  This new coop variant might be what it takes to get this game back on the table.

I&#039;ve skimmed through the this homebrew campaign book, and it wasn&#039;t immediately apparent what the minimum number of ships by size I would need for a campaign without an unreasonable amount of proxing.  Has any one done the math for, say, a 2-player coop campaign? (I&#039;m thinking a solo experience with 2 rebel ships would be more fulfilling.)  Thanks.

My rough estimate if playing with two rebel ships:

Rebel:

2 xwing, 1 hawk, 1 falcon, 1 Rebel Transport and if you want to upgrade your player ships then also 1-2 ywing, 1-2 awing, 1-2 bwing 

Empire:

5-6 ties, 3 tie interceptors, 2-3 tie bombers, 1 tie advanced, 1 shuttle, 1 decimator, 2 phantoms, 2 defenders

There is one mission that uses a second shuttle, but as an obstacle only, I plan on using a firespray for that.

Yikes. I may have to crunch the numbers on doing a one ship campaign then. That&#039;s going to be too much investment for me. :surprise:

I&#039;m close on the rebels. I have everything but the hawk and transport.

Nowhere close on the empire, though. I have several TIEs, an advanced and a Firespray. :gulp:

I got lucky because when I started collecting I was playing the Empire, so I have a lot of empire ships and I only bought a handful of rebel ships mostly for the cards. Given that this campaign requires a lot more empire ships than rebel ships all I really need to do is pick up a rebel transport, which I could proxy a tile for but I am so close to having everything I can&#039;t resist. 

It is possible to proxy any ship though. You don&#039;t need cards or pilot inserts or anything, the campaign gives you the pilot cards necessary.

The rules of SGOYT explicitly state that you are not to mention the concept of proxying if it would preclude buying something awesome like a giant ship model.

My wife and I have set a hard entertainment budget to see if we can live on just my paycheck. If I can somehow leave enough money at the end of the month, I&#039;m going to let myself get the transport... or Merchants and Marauders if I try this campaign and don&#039;t feel it.

That is quite an impressive goal.  Good luck with this, and I really hope it works out.

But all seriousness aside, you should buy both.  :devil:

Just think of this: My collection is pretty small, yet it would probably cost a good couple hundred bucks if you got it all at once. Several of my ships have been easy Christmas gift suggestions (and will continue to be).

So I took a break from PnP&#039;ing the campaign cards/terrain and checked on the computer. Turns out my FLGS got the Rebel Transport in stock again today AND was having a one-night-only 20% off end-of-summer sale... :whistle:

Guess who just came home with a rebel transport.

One thing I will suggest for those of you with some x-wing stuff but not enough to run the campaign, print out the AI cards for the Imperial ships and read the AI portion of the campaign book, you could easily put together missions/dogfights that use the AI and whatever ships you have lying around!

[q=&quot;garyrbrooks&quot;]You can&#039;t make me want this, you can&#039;t. I&#039;m not listening and I don&#039;t need it anyway.

It&#039;s not as if I love the theme, the quality of the minis and the thought of taking on a tie fighter in an x wing.[/q]

Actually, that really does some up my feelings, but I can see why someone whose tastes were different from mine would be sorely tempted. Courage mon brave !

Those asteroids are so cool!

Also I can&#039;t believe I missed the sale.  I was on their website earlier that day and almost ordered something, and then I went to check their website for something less than 10 minutes after the sale ended which is when I noticed the announcement.  I&#039;m sure at least one purchase that is probably going to happen anyway in the coming months would have happened last night (Glass Road).  And I would have had to look around a bit of course :)

And those asteroids are so cool (yes I know I&#039;m repeating myself)!

I made those asteroids after looking at the battlefield in a box ones you can buy (5 for $45!). Bought a $7 bag full of bbq lava rocks and a 1/8&quot; masonry bit to drill the holes and now I have enough supplies to make hundreds of them. I made 6 more last night as the Heroes of Aturi campaign has at least one mission with 12 asteroids. 

Spent last night cutting up all the cards and terrain and character sheets etc. for the campaign. Going to start with the intro mission again and then play through a full campaign, so watch for a lot more posts from me on this one (sorry folks!).

	<body>Wow! Last time I played this game was on july 5th!!! :wow: Thanks to my [b][geekurl=/geeklist/186801/100x-explore-expand-exploit-and-exterminate-100-pl]100 play challenge[/geekurl][/b] for the game...

Since I make a lot of mistakes at the [geekurl=/thread/1329227/sgoyt-space]SGOYT in space[/geekurl] PBF I decided to play the DM scenario on Good Luck! this morning. To get back into the game.

What can I say? First DM was a joke. But the second DM made a joke out of me. :p Shortest session report ever? Maybe.

:thumbsup: I really like this game but
:thumbsdown: I need to play it more often (again).</body>

I am actually really busy until Monday, and as I heard you have vacations :whistle:
Otherwise wait until Monday and I will make some suggestions. And I for myself do not mind a slower start, I actually like building my empire from ground up. But we can also use the quick start.

	<body>I am baffled.

1. The game is BETTER in solo mode than most solitair games without ... solo rules.

2. It has beautiful components for planes but only a blue rather featureless map.

3. Squadrons and Flights break up ... and fight ends with one or two attacks, sometimes without even a plane shot down !!!

4. I can&#039;t stop playing. Addicted after one week.

[ImageID=2592194medium]

Now I read in the GMT Geek list it is already out of print at GMT and they launched on July 10 ... !

The biggest surprise for 2015 to me. 

Better be fast to pick up a copy if in doubt.

Just follow the line up of the scenarios. You will learn the mechanics by following their order.

Scenario 3 hooked me though: German Stalingrad transporters need to fly in ... and after 5 plays I still couldn&#039;t get a win with the Russian green pilots.

50 minutes of fun. Although you can choose to play for hours in the last scenarios with masses of squadrons that . can break without even losing a single plane. Marvellous new game mechanics in a realistic setting.

Just one more walk to the top of the misty mountain before dinner!
[imageid=2654658 medium]


I could see the mountain looming in the distance far on the other side of the lake
but I could also  see that the path along the bank was probably too steep. 
[imageid=2654659 medium]

So I set out to take the left route around the lake...
[imageid=2654660 medium]


...past the old castle...
[imageid=2654661 medium]

...where I finally found the end of the lake – the mountain was close now. [imageid=2654662 medium]

And suddenly the old path from the castle to the mountain top
appeared before my eyes: [imageid=2654663 medium]


Unfortunately it turned out to be very exhausting – 
when I finally had reached the top,
eager to see the sun set over the forest, the fog was already there:
I couldn´t see anything anymore – 
and it was impossible to find the way down again!
[imageid=2654664 medium]

I was going to be late for dinner this time..

I keep looking this up so I can stare at it. Knowing I&#039;ll never go through the effort of printing and playing.  And wondering if there is a part of me, deep within, who has the patience to print, cut, paste, and do whatever else is required of a PnP.

as a space agency project leader you´ll have to make the best use of your resources and manage your space explorer missions well to make as many interesting discoveries as possible. 

You will be exploring this gorgeous looking galaxy (ours): 
[imageid=2654668 medium]


those were my four mission goals: 
the Moon (not very exciting – and bad for victory points..), Deimos, Ganymede and Europa. 
All conveniently close together and on the same route. 
I started the game by sending out a couple of space explorers to find out 
which instruments I had to take there 
to make the most of the research possibilities they had on offer:
[imageid=2654669 medium]

Turn 5: 
my agency proudly presents: the first rocket to the Moon and to Europa!(left in the picture)
only the most expensive stuff on board..
[imageid=2654672 medium]


After that early pinnacle of success my agency went through a valley of bad luck: 
Malfunctioning Space Explorers, 
trouble on the Moon with getting the Surface Lander to work, 
unreliable Space Observatory...
[imageid=2654673 medium]
 

but then the Golden Age of Space exploration begun: 
In turn 9 I managed to construct my second rocket, 
equipped for missions to Deimos and Ganymede: 
[imageid=2654674 medium]

No problems to find out everything interesting about Deimos 
but for Ganymede I had to concentrate my efforts..
[imageid=2654675 medium]

which worked out in the end – 
here all of my 6 discoveries that brought me victory: 
[imageid=2654676 medium]



:thumbsup:very beautiful!
:thumbsup:fun to do long term planning: which rocket to send where, what stuff to put on board, etc.
:thumbsup:uncertainty on how it will work out: you have to be flexible on the way and be able to change plans

:thumbsdown:unsure about replayability: there seems to be one main strategy - but that can be also due to my inexperience with the game!

obviously this present game here is not as complex but could maybe serve as a nice introductory version for it? :)

Another loss 31-38, a lot closer this time. My mistake laying my 12th and ending it, even though the bot was on 11, I could have perhaps produced / consumed a few more VPs to make it even closer. Oh well.

Yay! My first Test and thank you, One Player Guild, I love it!
Will try the monthly challenge shortly when I add all the optional rules.

:thumbsup: quick and easy setup, small footprint
:thumbsup: at least until now a lot of tension. You can do your math to calculate the upcoming track, but the dice have something to say, too. :angry: of course it&#039;s a lot of luck involved but I like it in this kind of games.
:thumbsup: lots of track combinations. 

Really fun solo, but will try it ftf soon, too.

At the moment I&#039;m trying to learn and juggle the rules for The Kings Armory and Claustrophobia (which I just got today in a trade). And after a few beers while reading them, I decided to take a break and play a game.

I&#039;m not sure why, but I decided to try Space Hulk again.

I actually did alright in the first room, nobody had died and I managed to move on to the second room quite easily. Then the red die of doom struck. Again.

I lost three marines in that room before escaping to the next one. And then I lost the other three in the next two rounds. I didn&#039;t kill a single enemy in the first try. The tokens on my marines that let me reroll turned out to be completely useless. My rolls just got worse and worse.

So after letting my whole team get slaughtered, I decided to get another beer and call it a night.

:thumbsdown: That
:thumbsdown: wretched
:thumbsdown: red
:thumbsdown: die!</body>

	<body>I suffered a crushing defeat thanks to a complete collapse of Turkish national will, but boy did I have fun doing it!

I played the historical deck again, reading all the flavor text on each card.  For those of you who have this game, if you haven&#039;t already done so I encourage you to do this.  WWI history is so interesting, and something I don&#039;t know as much about as other wars.  My high school focused mostly on WWII and Civil War.

Session details here:  [listitem=4114075][/listitem]

:thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup: This game has so much going for it.  Thematically strong, puzzly, tough decisions to make, loads of tension, die chucking, beautiful art, nice components, affordable and on and on...

[imageid=2655204 medium]

:thumbsup: Highly recommended. :)

I fully agree. And [thing=149361][/thing] is an equally great experience. 

In fact these games wet my appetite for more games like these. It even made me buy Path of Glory again after trading it away, as I didn&#039;t find PoG realistic enough with some very odd cards play.

But these games with 1 hour playing time and purely based on DR&#039;s have an incredible thematic card play without being pretentious of being &quot;real&quot; simulations or wargames.

Between Labyrinth or a Coin system, it shows you can have huge fun without the need of a university degree and still see a strong narritive story telling.

	<body>My first divergence from my month with Awakening the Bear. I wanted to get in a quick play of something before my daughter woke up from her nap.

It&#039;s probably common sense, but poor shuffles can go both ways in this game. I thought I did a pretty good shuffle after my last game, but even though I tried to mix things up as I was setting up, I still ended up with a lot of cards right in a row as I needed them. I cleared all the face down starting cards before I even got to the 3rd page I believe. It was an easy win that I didn&#039;t bother to score.

I think this will be one that requires a shuffle both before and after each play to ensure randomness. I still had fun this play, but it wasn&#039;t really a challenge.

[b]Update:[/b] Well no dang wonder I&#039;m thinking this game is so easy. I thought that when you set up the passenger&#039;s rescue, you could play as many cards as you can from what you draw. Turns out you can only play ONE. That makes things way more restricting. Without even playing another game I can see why the &quot;victory&quot; condition is set at 19.

The Great Rules Bungler strikes again!

[b]Update:[/b] Just played a game using the crew member that lets you play all the cards you draw, but doesn&#039;t let you draw new action cards, meaning you get 2 for the entire game.

I scored a 12. That&#039;s more like it.</body>

	<body>So, completed two Crossfire missions (as per previous postings) and finally getting to select some stickers, my runners chose:

Troll Mage / Face - chose the extra Nuyen
Human Decker / Street Samurai - chose &#039;Got Your Backs&#039;

The runners took on their first Extraction. Pounding the mean streets of Seattle teaming with Amazonites, they were hire to get a Client away from Pike (or is it Pine? Who can tell which?).

After some tense times, and a few hits healed, the Runners managed to Get the client across town to the ruins (that is, as new) of the EMP.

Success!</body>

As I&#039;ve said, I&#039;ve found the extraction scenario far easier.  I&#039;ve won 4 of the last 5 times. I&#039;ll have to add some of the difficulty variants since my team is up to 32 karma now.  

If &quot;got your backs&quot; is the one that lets you heal a staggered runner it&#039;s not real useful for extraction because it&#039;s too late to keep their opponents from moving back to the client and you can&#039;t use it on the client.  

I&#039;ve played it with two and four and it&#039;s great with both. 4 lets me choose things like the bonus that puts a 7th card in the black market which has helped.

Oops, did not realise that you could not use the &#039;Got Your Backs&#039; on the Client. I did. He finished with three hits, so it would not have affected the game in the end. I will choose something else.

I did find the Extraction easier. My game was tense, as I was walking the fine line between success and failure most of the game, but finished with most of my hits left.

	<body>The fight back starts now.

After banging on about how good Sentinels of the Multiverse is it was time for my historically favourite super hero game to put its underpants on over its tights and go to work.

Inspired by the great post by [b][user=ibbo][/user] [/b] and because this is sitting in the incorrect spot in my current [geeklist=189816]Top 20[/geeklist] I decided to try and play this 5 times today.

I played using the set up for the Week 7 Challenge - they stopped creating them after about 30+ challenges but plenty to try and someone else has started a new set of challenges.  Here&#039;s the link to the original challenges thread: [thread=1008529][/thread]

Turned out to be easy to achieve those 5 plays.  The first 3 games were over very quickly. The first game after just 3 turns, the third game after 4.  That was a reminder of how frustrating this game can be when the decks have clumps of cards together.

The fourth game went much better and I was doing ok and took down Loki for a third time with this combo:

[ImageID=2654711 medium]
Only for this to be the tactics card:

[ImageID=2654712 medium]
Those two KO&#039;d bystanders brought the total to 4 KO&#039;d and that meant the end.

I decided to play a fifth game but decided to try Weekly Challenge #8. This was a much more straight forward challenge.  This was a lot of fun and I got to about two turns from the end and managed to take down Magneto for the final time.

These last two games reminded me how fun this can be when you get a good deck together and get some great combos.

Anyway, this will definitely be moving up my top 20 (currently at 20) after these plays but I&#039;m also reminded why it probably won&#039;t crack the top 10.  The way the hive deck is constructed in Legendary Encounters stops that game being over too quick and that&#039;s why that game will probably end up higher than this in my list and my favourite deck builder overall.

:thumbsup: Theme and mechanics - I love super heroes and deck builders.

:thumbsdown: The decks can sometimes conspire against you and end games very quickly.</body>

I&#039;m actually subscribed to that thread and keep meaning to use it but never do for some reason.

If I get in some more plays before the end of November I will try to use this variant.  It does look good.

So I have been house-ruling Legendary for awhile now to stop this problem. I look at the particular plot I am playing and see if there is a &quot;you lose when the last scheme card appears&quot; type of condition. If so, then I take one of the scheme/bystander/whatever cards and put it aside. I shuffle the rest of the bad-guy deck. Then I pull 4 cards, add the held card, and shuffle those together. This small packet goes to the bottom of the deck. This keeps the game from being over before it even starts.

Cheating? Possibly. Less frustrating? Definitely.

Give it a try. You will probably feel that the game plays better for that type of scenario.

I might give that a go Darrel. at least a game would last longer than set up.

It wouldn&#039;t have helped this time though as I lost quickly due to the bystanders that had come out of the Hero deck (Save Humanity scheme).

	<body>Got the 2nd edition version last week.

Just about finished skimming the rules in total -- counters are punched out. This weekend I should attempt my first game - figure it will be slow to start as I study the rules in depth as things come up. But I&#039;m excited about the game - always have favored games about the Pacific War in WWII.

Components - counters, map, and play aids - are all great quality.

When I was laying out the mounted map, unfortunately I found that in 2 corners of 1 map panel the top layer of the map was slightly peeling. But I contacted GMT Support and they have added my name to a replacement map board when they get some in the future. Excellent response.

Haven&#039;t figured out if it would be better to try playing the Japanese first or the Allies. Any suggestions?</body>

I think you will have a much easier time playing the Allies first. The Allied bot is very difficult to manage in the early turns while the Japanese one is fairly straightforward and won&#039;t require as much management from you.

I also recently picked this up and played through a couple of games. It is a fabulous game but you definitely want to take it slow and steady!

To echo what Peter said, I&#039;d recommend playing the Allies and using the Japanese bot for your first game. I found the Allied bot a bit trickier to implement at the start of the game. I also found it a little easier to win against the Allied bot because of the way it handles the Progress of War rules. Next time I play as the Japanese I&#039;m going to do a bit more of playing both sides during the Allied mid game and not religiously follow the Allied bot instructions.

	<body>Dug out my old version - huge boards! - with the 1991 season. I never really played this much as a board game -- had started various seasons using the computer version over the decads but never really finished any project. But thinking about a small tournament using some of the &#039;91 teams and playing it manually - will help to better understand the nuances the system.

If I like this, I am considering the purchasing the latest Master game edition which replaces the awkward boards with a nice booklet. If I can stomach the crazy shipping cost of it to Canada -- shipping is the same price as the booklet! Yes, I know European or Australian costs are even worse.</body>

	<body>This one has been languishing at the bottom of the pile for a while.  It needs playing more often. :)

I was very lucky with the opening draw, with a high proportion of strength 3 cards.  This meant I could snaffle a couple early on relatively cheaply.  This meant (unusually) I &#039;boosted&#039; a card using an Indian only once in the entire game.

I recruited Old Toby (horse + canoe -&gt; 6 movement river or mountain), Twisted Hair (1 canoe -&gt; 2 canoes), and Rene Jassaume (3 fur -&gt; 1 horse [necromancy! :devil:])

This fine team powered me across the continent, leaving MacKenzie gasping in my wake.  A slight exaggeration maybe...  He started 2 spaces in front of me and ended 3 spaces behind as I powered far into the pacific.

Resource management seemed to come easy during this run.  It took six camps to get across.  On the last two camps, my rafts were carrying zero resources. :cool:

My brain is too often frazzled at the end of the day and a thinky optimisation puzzle isn&#039;t often top of the list.  However, when I am in the right mood, this is fantastically rewarding.

:thumbsup: A great optimisation puzzle.
:thumbsup: Quick setup and teardown.
:thumbsup: Hex &#039;cubes&#039; feel very pleasing.
:thumbsup: Fantastic artwork
:thumbsdown: Cards a bit thin (although have a good tough finish)
:thumbsdown: Too easy to forget to move MacKenzie in the solo variant

	<body>My other play this evening was this altogether different game.  Thematic as ever, this game sucks you in despite its small(ish) footprint and simple (but high quality) components.

This time it was the turn of Book, Flamer, and Claws teams to try their luck.

Unfortunately Mr Flamer was an early casualty in the first location.  Despite being on the back foot so early, the team pressed on.  A lot of luck (!) kept the Claws and Book teams going until the last location.  The loss of the entire Flamer team hampered the action selection.

Then it all went wrong.

They started dropping like flies.  Judicious use of the Power Field kept some glimmer of hope, and both blip piles were slowly emptied - sadly at the expense of a million &#039;stealers in play.

The star Book team marine (Mr &#039;Chain Attack&#039;) was the last one standing.  No &#039;curse of the zero&#039; for him.  Standing alone, a Gun Jam event proved too much to overcome and he was swamped on both sides.

I love this game :devil:</body>

	<body>My second play of this game proved to be a little easier than the last because of the house layout that I built (I randomly select tiles and placement, then deal with the rotation issues).  Early on I had fire spreading and consumed one of the 3 paths back to the entrance.  I was able to maneuver around hordes of zombies in the early game and get the door to the lab unlocked.  

The second half of the game was full of trashy goodness - I rolled enough successes to reduce the boss&#039;s movement from 3 to 1 space, giving me enough time to bring the rest of the team in, but fear struck and they ran away towards a dead end while the zombie hordes started to close in.  They hucked a dynamite charge into the neighboring room and did enough damage to win the game; but since this was a gas leak room, the room blew up sealing off any path back to the entrance.  The team had no choice but to break the window and dive out before the house consumed itself in flames.</body>

	<body>My wife and daughter watched a movie that I didn&#039;t care for so I got this game out. I don&#039;t play it very often but I keep thinking about it. Challenging but easy to pick up. I did the Omaha Beach map and couldn&#039;t make it past Sector 8.

:thumbsup: Thinky but quick to pick up. It doesn&#039;t seem like Yahtzee at all 

:thumbsdown: Highly symbolic so it take a bit to figure out what goes well.

:thumbsdown: Fiddly to setup. I keep the starting dice, people, and equip infor Omaha Beach in a Altoids tin so I got have to sort them out.

	<body>I&#039;m at my parent&#039;s house for the weekend and we&#039;re all packed in here. Everyone&#039;s tired from hanging out in the sun at a nearby pool...so I whipped out my old fav that I brought along &quot;ïn case anyone wanted to play&quot;. :D

For maybe the first or second time, I played on Elite level. I randomly drew the Pilot and Navigator and randomly drew...&quot;The Island of Death.&quot; Basically it&#039;s sort of T-shaped. 

The game was going pretty well. I had 2/4 treasures by the re-shuffle and was set up for the third after the re-shuffle and got it quickly. I was also ready for the fourth relatively quickly, but I had to use the Helicopter cards to keep the remaining treasure location open and so was trying to wait out the deck for the next re-shuffle because I needed a helicopter card (never mind that I had the pilot?). Anyhow, they stood alone on Fool&#039;s Landing feeling like fools as the waves closed over...:soblue:

	<body>Early in my game tonight I wasn&#039;t getting any DNA that I needed to be able to expand, which was incredibly frustrating.  The tuskers finally come down, and I had sized up where I could predate them. That started my expansion and I finally started to gain on them, but headed into the 3rd phase of the game I was significantly behind.  I triggered an catastrophic event which wiped out the AI (greater than 7 DNA), so I wasn&#039;t sure how I should continue - see if I should survive or not.  I left it on the table for tomorrow morning once I determine what the right rule is.</body>

	<body>Since I didn&#039;t finish I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s right to post this as a game play, but I tried to play Mistfall again (3rd time out). This time around I tried using Arani the Cleric. She did pretty well in the first encounter (but I was using both &quot;easy&quot; options - more time and more starting cards). Then the next area and encounter ended up with relentless bloodtrackers, so I couldn&#039;t disperse them even though I was able to get rid of the encounter. And I couldn&#039;t sort out how to proceed after the encounter was ended. With 2 bloodtrackers and reinforcements coming it seemed like I just kept getting ground down and couldn&#039;t make much headway. Seemed like she could only get a hit by discarding her mace and then she was weaponless for a while. So I finally packed it away.

I took a peek at the rules for the &quot;campaign&quot; - otherwise known as &quot;how to string together 4 scenarios&quot;.

Next I think I need to get out a lighter game and/or a game I know how to play without searching through rulebooks that I find difficult to follow.</body>

	<body>I liked this so much more than I thought I would.  I played the first game solo with two characters, Kirk and Spock.  Per the rulebook, if you play with 2 players, then you use characters numbered 1-2.  Which are Kirk and Spock.  But then it says that someone has to play Bones (for healing) otherwise the game is hard.  I opted to play Kirk and Spock, and it was game over pretty quick.  Healing is important in this game.  There are cards that can provide minimal healing, but there aren&#039;t many and they only heal one injury.  

My husband was interested, so we played the second game together using Kirk and Bones.  It was really hard, even with healing.  We just never had enough dice it seemed.  We lost by failing too many missions.

We played a third time, this time each controlling two characters.  He had Kirk and Scotty, and I had Spock and Bones.  This was a much better game.  It was still pretty close there at the end, but we won at the Ensign (easiest) level.  

I noticed on the box that it says it&#039;s a cooperative game for 3-7 players.  I think that you would need to be playing at least 3 characters for this game to be winnable.  And it&#039;s a lot more fun the more characters you have out.  When we play again, we&#039;ll definitely control two characters each. 

:thumbsup: As a lover of Star Trek: TOS, this game is a thematic win on so many levels.  Plus, they nailed all the graphic design.  Really well done.

:thumbsup: A unique addition to my collection.  Mechanics are creative.

:thumbsdown: I can&#039;t see myself playing this solo very often.  You really need at minimum three characters for this game to be winnable, and playing &quot;three-handed&quot; seems like a lot to manage.  (This is coming from the person who thinks it&#039;s too much to play LOTR:LCG two-handed, so take this for what it&#039;s worth.) Maybe someone creative will think of a good way to scale this down so it plays well solo?

:thumbsdown::thumbsup: Components have gotten a bit of a bad rap around here.  The cards could be better, they are on par with Onirim 2.0, but since you don&#039;t shuffle these cards very often (once per game), it&#039;s not the end of the world.  If you&#039;re worried, you can sleeve.  The rest of the components are great.  Nice heavy cardboard for the character mats and Enterprise mat.  The printing is done very well.  Nice quality dice too.

:thumbsup: It&#039;s just plain fun.  Sometimes you have to drop everything to resolve an urgent mission, sometimes you can&#039;t talk to your fellow players, sometimes the dice love you (or hate you)...it has a feel of Escape: The Curse of the Temple meets Pandemic.  It really is a lot of fun.

It&#039;s very easy to play multiple hands, as it only really affects your dice pool that round. I just use a marker to remind myself which character is currently up. I also use the houserule suggested by Ryan that when the communication down card comes up none of the characters can use their special ability til it is removed. Replaces the challenge of not being able to talk to the other players, since there is only me.

That&#039;s a good houserule.  I thought maybe I was supposed to stop talking out loud to myself.  My husband will be so disappointed to hear that&#039;s not the case.  :p

	<body>Using the solo variant available. 

This one lasted only one round!!! :soblue:

Went after control of one of wyatts deeds and called out a dude there. I had 4 dudes in the shootout and wyatt had 3. Lost one dude in a shootout play (those are pretty harsh!). We equaled hands during the shootout and lost one dude each. 2 dudes each, i thought, give it another crack, so we went another shootout round. Lost another dude during a shootout play and then wyatt got one hand better than me, so i lost my last dude. Wyatt had more control than i had influence and nothing i could do before the last phase of the round...defeat!!

Maybe i should be a bit more patient and selective!!! Enjoying this still!!</body>

I love this game and this is one of my favorite solo variants. It can be tough to be patient sometimes, but I find it best to be a bit methodical when taking on Wyatt. He can really surprise you in a shootout sometimes.

Played the AP scenario with 2 APs each getting 10 CPs per roll. Also played with the 30 CP home systems from the expansion AND Titans (of course) to speed things up.

Blue and yellow were the colors of the AP and blue started a bit slow but in the end it was blue who launched the first fleet. Scouts only but better than nothing.

Yellows rolls were for Tech and Econ. Crazy! I had to roll 6 dice in the later rounds during yellows econ phase.

I am sure that I played not everything correct but I&#039;ve won. :D Took quite some time. Hours... but in the end I&#039;ve won.

The blue one was out first. My Titans got his bases and HS down and out first. The yellow one was a pain in the butt since he had lots of CP for defense. But once I could focus on him only I grinded him down.

Some stuff felt strange. For example:
- I rolled crazy on ship size and only yellow went beyond ship size 2. :what:
- The yellow dude had tons of CP in Tech and Def but his CP in the fleet section was a laugh.
- I rarely rolled that the yellow one launched ships. Yellow had tons of technologies but not a lot of ships.
- Blue had tons of ships but max ship size 2. :what:

I guess I&#039;ve done something wrong there. I like that AP scenario but I think the fun starts when you know all those IFs and THENs by heart. Long road to go...</body>

	<body>Felt like a dungeon crawl so I pulled this out for a quick run.  This time around, the Cleric, Ranger and Wizard wandered into Castle Ravenloft to deal with Count Strahd&#039;s new monster - a Flesh Golem!!!

[ImageID=2656095 medium]

Things did not get off to a good start as I first came up against a Wraith.

[ImageID=2656097 medium]

Followed by a Gargoyle!

[ImageID=2656098 medium]

After defeating that first Wraith, I drew another one.  Good thing as having 2 wraiths activating at the same time could have resulted in a premature end to my quest.

[ImageID=2656099 medium]

The MVP in this game was, by far, the Cleric.  The Cleric was constantly in the thick of battle and his Flame Strike allowed me to clear rooms ...

[ImageID=2656100 medium]

Shortly after, he managed to level up which gave him an additional daily power.  Useful as he ended the game with all of his Daily and Utility powers used.

[ImageID=2656101 medium]

The Cleric even managed to find the Workshop which resulted in the villain reveal!  Which means its time for - Dramatic Dungeon Lighting!

[ImageID=2656102 medium]

This resulted in a running battle as the Flesh Golem made for the dungeon entrance while we chased after it, trying to calm it down.

The Ranger got knocked down by the Golem and we had no healing surges left.  By this time, we had managed to find 2 calm tokens for the Golem and there were 2 tokens left to choose from (the other 2 having been spied as being enrage tokens).  I had one last chance for the Cleric to act to try and win the game.  

If I guess correctly and showed the correct item, I would calm down the Golem and win the game.  If I showed the wrong item, the Ranger would act next and without a healing surge, the game would end with a loss.

[ImageID=2656103 medium]

I chose - well!!  I managed to calm the golem and win in the final act of the game!  Woot!

[b]Final thoughts[/b]
This is one of my favourite quests in the game for 2 reasons.  Firstly, the Flesh Golem mini is a great mini and looks awesome on the board.  As a general rule, I love quests which result in a final battle against a massive monster - what better way to end the quest!  Secondly, I love how the quest climaxes in a running battle through the dungeon as you try and keep up with the Golem as it heads for the entrance, only pausing occasionally to knock you back into the dungeon.  

Plus, I have this fantastic image in my head of the Dwarven Cleric running on stubby legs to keep up with the long strides of the Golem while frantically searching his backpack for various items which might calm the Golem down!

Edit: Thx to Suzy, I now know how to make these images [size=18]bigger[/size]! :cool:</body>

This is the only one of the series I own, I don&#039;t think I would benefit from owning more than one. It makes a nice change of pace when I haven&#039;t got time for Descent first edition.

[q=&quot;philmcd&quot;]This is the only one of the series I own, I don&#039;t think I would benefit from owning more than one. It makes a nice change of pace when I haven&#039;t got time for Descent first edition.

I also own a couple of the Dungeon Command series. I need to think whether I really need them as well as Ravenloft.[/q]

Agree with you on that - I got this one for the undead theme and don&#039;t have any interest in getting any of the others.  I&#039;ll be the first to admit that, out of the box, this isn&#039;t a fantastic game.  However, it fills my niche of having a &quot;minis based dungeon crawl experience that can be played through quickly&quot; almost perfectly which is why it will probably never leave my collection.

I don&#039;t have the Dungeon Command series - they looked more like PvP lite with the added benefit of expanding this game slightly.  Didn&#039;t really catch my interest.  I have better PvP games and there was already a ton of fan made content that I could add to this game.

Yeah but if you play D&amp;D or any fantasy table top, owning any or all of the 4 of this series and/or any of the Dungeon Command series gives you a crap load of fantastic minis.

I&#039;ve got fantasy minis from any number of games already, Descent and World of Warcraft boardgame alone is plenty, then 2 games of Shadows of Brimstone, Ravenloft....I think I&#039;ve got it covered even if I sell the Dungeon Commands.

Lots of folks seem to enjoy these games, but in spite of my love of minis and dungeon crawlers I traded away my Legend of Drizzt. Felt to me like &quot;kiting: the board game&quot;. I just couldn&#039;t get into it.

That&#039;s interesting as I never got the experience of kiting from this game.  I generally find that the monsters can move faster than you - particularly if you are trying to explore new tiles - so I always charged at enemies head on when they showed up (to be fair though, charging at enemies head on is my general approach to dungeon crawls :D).  

Plus, it&#039;s dangerous to leave enemies around as the game becomes extremely dangerous if another enemy of the same type shows up (as all monsters of the same type activate at the same time).  I wonder if the difference is caused by Legend of Drizzt (which I don&#039;t have and have never played)?

	<body>11th play of the North Africa campaign.

I am frustrated! Finally I know how to win this campaign BUT I lost due very bad die rolls. Next time.

Anyway, how to win this mission? It&#039;s all about supplies and Blitzkrieg! It&#039;s that simple here. Give the allies too much time and egypt is an invulnerable fortress. Move forward, exploit.

The 15th and 21st Pz units have to press forward as much as they can. I had fortress tobruk under control in round 2! Two areas under my control in turn 3. That means lots of resupplies.

Turn 5 and I had Alexandria. And that was when my dice decided to be against me.

[ImageID=2656157 large]

The allies had their Go! chit and new reinforcements on the map. Things still looked good here. I fought them off. Lost a few units but Alexandria was still mine. But only for one more turn.

[ImageID=2656158 large]

I had tons of resupplies and could buy lots of battle plans, I had Air Raid, German 88&#039;s, AT Guns... none of them scored a hit! Not even my defending units. I lost Alexandria.

The allies were about to take back what was theirs and punished me hard. I was checking a few times if those dice were red and not grey. Space Hulk? No.

A bit frustrating. I only lost because of those miserable die rolls. :yuk:</body>

	<body>A long time off the table, I sorted out the original expansion I&#039;d been lucky enough to find, and it seemed rude not to actually give the game a run once again. 

This was one of our very first games, picked up on good word of mouth - a few weeks before I discovered this place. It was played a lot - and then entered semi-retirement, as (lots of) new games came along. 

I love what this adds - even if I can&#039;t fit the Petri dishes in the base box. </body>

I have the original version of the base game and OtB.  I can fit everything in the base box including the Petri dishes.   But I need to turn one upside down and put it in the center, with the other four right side up forming an X shape in the box.  That way the lips of the lids will overlap the one in the center, laying flat enough to fit everything in and the lid closed all the way.

Not sure if that makes sense verbally.   I can take a pic sometime this week if it would help.  

Of course all that presumes the components are all the same size in the current version of the game.

Maybe we have something different, mo. I have the original version of OTB too. Really can&#039;t see how you&#039;d squeeze this is with all the cards and pieces.

Sorry, Jason.  Until I just now opened the box and read through the component list again, I completely forgot that it comes with six Petri dishes.  Since there are only five diseases, I just don&#039;t bother with the sixth, instead just storing the extra pieces in with the other disease cubes.  Here&#039;s what it looks like:

Cheers, Mo. Managed to squeeze it all in nicely, bar the spare Petri dish. As much as I know they&#039;re only cosmetic, I really do prefer having them on the table, too. (Certainly given how long I&#039;ve been looking for this expansion.) I look forward to reintroducing the game to my wife.

	<body>Hey, there&#039;s a new game out with really cool minis.  Thanks, but I already have enough.

It&#039;s fully co-op.  Hmmm.

With a persistent campaign, including branching side quests.  Oh....

And it has a steampunk theme.  Sold!
 
So it was, after watching Doug Herring&#039;s play through video series, that I purchased [thing=175334][/thing].  So far I&#039;ve finished the first mission and I like what I see so far.  The combat is several notches below what I like in game such as [thing=140519][/thing], but there are still enough choices each turn, and enough differentiating between the four characters, to keep it interesting.  The AI is also pretty good.

Kurt B. has already written up a very good summary of the game, so for that I direct you here:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1429282/my-new-favorite-co-op-time-being

I&#039;ll provide some pics below of my mission.

Here is that board that comes with the game.

[imageid=2656179 large]

Here is what it looks like after you set up the mission.

[imageid=2656187 large]

You can see some villain spawning areas to the west and northeast, as well as a possible side quest to pick up in the east.

The mission involves making your way to the dead body surrounded by four thugs in the north, and searching it while there are no villains in the space.  Once done, one of two possible bosses will appear for the final fight.

I&#039;m doing something with this campaign I rarely do: playing all four characters.  It&#039;s partly for the novelty, partly because each is so interesting I found it hard to leave any out, and partly because the ergonomics of the game allow it.  The playing area footprint is manageable.

I should highlight one character in particular, because it is in fact two: Pog and Doorstop.      

[imageid=2656230 large]

Doorstop is a huge Steamjack with a fearsome melee attack.  On his own, though, he can do no more than stand still or move one space.  Pog, however, can use one of his action to order Doorstop to do other things, such as charge.

All character have innate abilities they can use each turn, as well as Feat cards they can use to get additional bonuses or actions.  It allows for lot of choices to be made each turn.  The other three characters are a range attack specialist (Canice the Gun Mage Duelist), an alchemist with good AOE attacks (Milo the Cutthroat Alchemist) and a tanky type (Gardek the Trollkin Warrior).  In this first mission, we are up against crossbowmen and sword thugs, until the boss appears.

[imageid=2656233 large]

The characters activate in initiative order, and a turn consists spawning a villain, taking actions, and then drawing a Villain Action card to see what they will do.  Each round begins with an Event, which might introduce things such as Fog, that makes ranged attacks more difficult.

Canice began by using a Feat to advance two spaces and shoot at the thugs near the body.  She took out only one, and then two thugs charged her, but missed in their attacks.

[imageid=2656238 large]

Milo advanced next, joining Canice and tossing a bomb into the body space, killing a thug.

[imageid=2656247 large]

Pog then ordered Doorstop to charge, and he pulverized the two swordsman with his mace and shield.  Pog held back, as he planned to race to the east to pick up the side quest.  During this turns, the enemy was mainly activating crossbowmen and peppering my heroes with crossbolts.

[imageid=2656249 large]

Finally Gardek advanced two spaces, and when a sword thug activated to charge him he used a counter-charge Feat to intercept and kill the thug.

[imageid=2656275 large]

The Event deck serves as a timer, and we were about 2/3 of the way through it when Gardek finally managed to search the body with no villains present.  At that point, an Epic Ogrun (aka orc) Boss appeared, accompanied by two crossbowmen and two sword thug.

[imageid=2656276 large]

By this time, every crossbowman in the mission was on the board, and we were being continually bombarded by a grand battery of bolts.  We finally put together some well-orchestrated uses of Feats and abilities to take down the boss, capped off by a boosted acid flask attack from Milo, and the boss went down.

[imageid=2656278 large]

My heroes will actually carry some of their wounds over to the next mission, as you heal only three hits between them.  I can see already that the next mission will play out completely differently, giving me high hopes for the rest of the campaign.  I also get to use the XPs gained during the mission to buy Feat and ability upgrades.

I initially overlooked this game because it is listed as 2-4 players.  In fact, it is perfectly solo-able, and I am liking it so far.

I saw this arrive at my FLGS, but looked it up on BGG, saw the player count and moved on. Guess I should have looked deeper! I&#039;ve said it before but why don&#039;t manufacturers realize that indicating on the box/in the description that a game can be played solo will increase its customer base? Without this list I wouldn&#039;t own [thing=178613][/thing] and I wouldn&#039;t even be considering this game. I think we should get an automatic discount on soloable games given how much promotion we do here for free!

I played out the second campaign mission tonight and had a great time.  It was much more of a challenge.  Milo the Alchemist at one point was down to one hit point.  Also, I managed to pick up the second part of a side quest chain, after getting the first in the initial mission.  Best of all, with two missions&#039; worth of XP to spend, I have picked up some very cool new abilities for all four of my characters.  There is more to this game than I had initially thought.

Colour me interested, even though I don&#039;t really need any more minis based dungeon crawlers... hasn&#039;t stopped me before though :whistle:

I have been tempted by [thing=156548][/thing] and its co-op mode, but watched some videos and read some reviews and the gameplay just doesn&#039;t seem worth the price. Considered Descent with the user made AI, but it hasn&#039;t reached the must have threshold yet.

Keep us updated on this one, it might tempt me yet!

My watching of game play videos of Super Dungeon Explore also turned me off it.

After thinking about Undercity for a bit, I realized the game it most resembles is [thing=138431][/thing].  It&#039;s got a scripted campaign, heroes that level up their abilities and AI actions that are determined by drawing cards.  Sometimes a villain right next to you won&#039;t activate because of the card draw, something I recall happening in GD.

Then there was this sword thug, who evidently graduated from the Imperial Stormtrooper School of Accuracy and Aiming.  He was in the same space as Canice the Gun Mage Duelist for almost half the mission, and never was able to land a blow.

[imageid=2657675 large]

Another minor thing to note: some of the board is interactable (sp?).

This poor crossbow thug was standing in a passage with loose rocks.  Milo tosses a bomb into the space.

[imageid=2657682 large]

Not only is the crossbowman gone, but the bomb also managed to hit the rocks, thereby turning them into rubble.  Rough terrain uses all movement points to enter.  I did this to slow down any boss who might enter from the connected spawn point.  In fact, none did.  But, as Big Jim McBob and Billy Sol Hurok used to say, the passageway blowed up real good!

One of my good friends and I just started playing this game. We&#039;re having a blast with it. I really like the way the AI works. It&#039;s pretty unique. I&#039;ve been working on rules reference for the game, which I&#039;ll post soon, hopefully.

	<body>I feel like I&#039;ve landed on the moon, this weekend, as for the first time since she was born, in May, my wife and daughter are out of the country. I thought I&#039;d get a tonne of game-time in, but I seem to be wandering around in a bit of a sad daze. Being at work and coming home to an empty house, is one thing, a slow weekend seems quite another. 

Which random silliness has little to do with the fact that this hit the table - other than the fact that I&#039;m determined to make some gaming hay whilst the sun shines. A mammoth rulebook and a tonne of stuff to work through. Haven&#039;t made it as far as a game, but I&#039;m excited for it. Looks like a lot of fun - and I&#039;m a sucker for novelty dice, so I have no issue with the randomness. 

And, sad as it might seem, there are few things to give me such a warm fuzzy feeling, these days than an insert that does the job right. :)

I dig this game. A little fiddly to get started, but once you are rolling it clicks pretty quickly. I have been eyeing the expansions, but I need to play the base game a bunch more before I can justify the cost. I did pick up the elite army expansion though :whistle:

	<body>This was my first truly solo game purchase iirc (I think I had Mice and Mystics before it).

It still hasn&#039;t grabbed me, but I think playing it a few times in a close proximity may be helpful there.  Looking up the special abilities constantly is a pain, and playing only every few months doesn&#039;t help develop a sense of what works better vs not.

I do know it is possible to win as the last time I played I won with 59.  Today though? -11 :(

It is on my 10x10 challenge so I&#039;m going to play it a few more times soon and see how it goes.

Edit: actually that -11 was a lot lower.  I only subtracted 1 point per undefeated hazard not 3 and there were a lot.

Game 2: win, 52 points.  Sort of.  I&#039;m pretty sure I forgot to mix in an aging card one of those shuffles.  I accommodated for that once I hit the pirates but who knows, it might have made the difference.

Still not sure why sometimes purging my deck works and sometimes it doesn&#039;t.  Maybe it will come to me.</body>

Yes, looking up the special abilities is annoying, but you&#039;ll start to memorize that the more you play.

I selected this game as my &quot;100 Plays&quot; game, and it is really holding up.  I&#039;m glad it&#039;s on your 10x10 challenge because I think after 10 plays, you&#039;ll love it.  This has become my go-to quick solo game on the weekdays when I don&#039;t have time for something longer, but want a rich solo experience.

My first &#039;truly&#039; solo game too - I kept the rule book open right next to my playing area for the first five, or so, games I played; just to check the double/copy/exchange (etc.) stuff. Great fun though - got my first win two days ago. Time for level two now...

I&#039;ve only won level two once, and it was several months ago.  Played about 5 times in the last week.  Not even close to winning again.  Starting to feel a bit like Andreas.  This game can get to you.

	<body>Played another game and a half of this last night. Didn&#039;t get far into Emergence when things went sour. One COG was bleeding out and Dom was in bad shape so I in desperation threw a grenade into a five locust area. I killed four of them and wounded one. Unfortunately it wasn&#039;t enough, the AI turn had the drone attack and barely take Dom out. I played a bit through a second try but I didn&#039;t have the stamina to make it through. 

:thumbsup: tactical decisions are still holding up, run and take cover? Don&#039;t use a card and just use the basic options? Use a ammo chit? Use a card for follow or guard?

:thumbsdown: uh, I have lost barely into the second location of the board twice now. I either am quite dumb tactically or this is just quite hard. Not really a negative but a small trend at the start here.

:thumbsup: Fun solo but might also be fun with others and could be used to hook some Gamers club kids who are use to video games and not board games.

On something like my 20th play, I lost on the first tile. Sometimes, that&#039;s just the way it goes.

Printed, laminated, corner clipped and decked out with its playing goodies.

Running the first few turns and the ship was doing well. Seventeen turn into the game and things were getting tense. Turn twenty-one, shields are down hull is a 6 and that dreaded Meteroids card triggers for minus 5 hull and with a final card that triggers for a further minus 1 and the ship&#039;s hull buckles opens up to the vacuum.

I hope things go better me on the next game.

I played it before he edited the game. I really loved this game! It really seems like it should be so simple to win. But then you still somehow lose. You keep thinking to yourself &quot;I can magage this.&quot;


... But at some point, you can&#039;t.


Need to play this game again.

Last week I went on with my [geeklist=196079]&quot;Catch up&quot; - Month[/geeklist] and played mainly expansions. Startet with this dice chucking zombie game.

Light and easy... Only played it solo so far but I consider this one more a filler than a full game at least when you just look at the complexity. For my taste it takes just a bit too long as it should. Especially when you have to reshuffle the location deck...

:thumbsup: Nice minis and artwork
:thumbsup: Light and easy to learn
:thumbsdown: VERY light
:thumbsdown: Takes too long for what it is</body>

8th Summit, as the result of a recent KS, will have an expanded solo game for Rung, Fight or Die! at the end of September or early October.

[q]...The large mat you see under the box of Courthouse is for the solo.game . It was printed oversize so it really looks great on the table.  This mat is used to place all cards drawn during the coarse of your game, so you don&#039;t really need, it but it&#039;s very thematic and puts your mind into the story.  Between rounds you are said to be back at the Courthouse where you place collected cards.  The solo game turned out to be a significant little game in itself that we will make it available to order on the website later this year. It won&#039;t be retail however...[/q]

The solo rules can be found here: [url]http://www.8thsummit.net/community/index.php?resources/run-fight-or-die-solo-campaign-rules.7/[/url]

The last of the three games was a solo co-op variant with three characters.
[ImageID=2656731]

At the end I won in the second round against Lord Kazzak...

Still a great game :D I probably will not long resist until I gonna order the big box expansion even I already at the limit with space on my gaming table.

:thumbsup: Brings a lot more variety for the character development

I have the basic game and the 2 expansions waiting for solo play, but I am so much into historical Consims these days, that it gets postponed every few months.

As an avid old WoW player I am more than interested but apart from Eldritch Horror it is all Consims and wargames these days...

December is my next goal ....

	<body>I really enjoyed this solo variant.  Has a great flow and is very intuitive.  

Details here:  [listitem=4114077][/listitem]

:thumbsup: D&amp;D Dice Masters is a great addition to the Dice Masters family.  It&#039;s nice to have an alternative theme to comics (and I&#039;m really not interested in Yu-Gi-Oh).  The art is well done and the thematic abilities are great.  Dragons are especially fun.

:thumbsup: Solid solo variant that&#039;s easy to learn, easy to memorize and replicates an opponent very well.  

:thumbsup: Fun to set up, picking characters is one of my favorite parts, and looking at the all pretty dice on the table

:thumbsup: Quick and satisfying game play.  

:thumbsdown: I might have spent a crazy amount of money on this because I&#039;m a bit of a collector with some things (ahem, Dice Masters and LOTR:LCG...).  You can definitely get a ton a great play out of just a base game and a few booster packs, but oh my I have no discipline when it comes to &quot;just say no to the gravity feed&quot;

:thumbsup: Opening gravity feeds is one of the most fun things ever!

:thumbsdown: Booster pack cards are often bent up a bit.  Card quality isn&#039;t stellar.  

:thumbsup: Did I mention all the pretty dice?  :D

	<body>Just a quick report. Was at my parents over the weekend and my sister was in town with her husband and  two little ones. I broke this out to play alone and my 3 year old nephew, who&#039;s pretty rambunctious and loves attention, asked if he could play. I said sure and he climbed on my lap. 

We were obviously playing two different games. I was playing Lewis &amp; Clark while he would cheer when I filled up my boats with resources (which is actually not a good thing :D ) saying &quot;yay, you filled up the last spaces!&quot;. Or, when I&#039;d say something like &quot;I need a canoe&quot; he&#039;d point at the plano and go &quot;they&#039;re in there!&quot;

I played on the easiest level and won. As I saw the game was coming to a close, I threw out a strength 3 scout-movement card and played the 3 canoes I had in stock, jumping me forward 12 spaces from the mountains, then 7 spaces back for time spent. Ending just ahead of Fort Clatsop, I beat Mackenzie by 1. 

Since I was a little distracted this game and I couldn&#039;t find any privacy to play, I wasn&#039;t totally into this session. That&#039;s not a statement about the game, rather the session. It&#039;s awesome picking out cards and figuring out the best way to combine them. Almost, dare I say it, Mage Knight-esque.

My nephew is adorable. At one point, he looks up at me from the game with his big blue eyes and goes &quot;I love you&quot;. So yeah, I got to play a game and, aside from the distraction of a little boy on my lap commenting throughout the game (which negatively affected the engrossment/immersion that us sologamers find so addictive), it was time well spent. 

This post is actually the kind that I would hate to read as I love to learn real thoughts about various games and this one has almost nil. However, I know some of you love emotional &quot;Awwww&quot; stories so here you go, one from me :)

:thumbsdown: In the solo game, it&#039;s really hard to keep track of moving Mackenzie!

Next game, Mackenzie is starting one space up from me!</body>

Ouch! That looks painful. After dinner tonight I am going to dig into the campaign I posted about above. Can&#039;t wait! I have tomorrow off too for the holiday so I am hoping to get two or three games in (at least). With the campaign printed and ready to go, I expect the first half of this month is going to be mostly X-wing for me.

I&#039;m glad you were able to get a copy and that it is living up to your hopes!  It was very generous of you to share your find with other people too, I hope they get as much enjoyment as you.

I&#039;m still saving my copy... haven&#039;t cracked the shrink.  I think I have a fair bit of playing to do before I&#039;m ready for it.  It was one of those grab it while you can things though.

	<body>While I am [b]waiting[/b] for [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172737/high-frontier-3rd-edition]High Frontier (3rd Edition)[/url] to arrive I&#039;ve been playing light to midweight space-based games.   I have limited energy so my brain gets foggy after about 45 minutes or an hour.   My will power probably goes down as well so it is hard to drag myself away from games even when I realize I&#039;m becoming incapacitated.

[i]Star Trek: Expeditions[/i] has gotten mixed reviews.  Radho liked it and several people have said it was similar to [i]Pandemic[/i] which I quite enjoy.  After playing ST:E I would say it is more like a very light version of [i]Eldritch Horror[/i] because you move around and buff up characters while you try to accomplish several simultaneous goals by passing tests that involve buffs and dice.  I quite enjoyed it and I look forward to playing it some more.

After reading up on BGG I decided to play with [i]Uhura[/i] and [i]Kirk[/i] on the medium difficulty setting.   I would have Uhura mostly stay on the ship and scrye the energize deck (she can give cards to other players much like Charlie &quot;Citizen&quot; Kane in EH) while Kirk has his usual adventures on the ground.  I also planned to buff up the Enterprise as early as I could.  There are two timers in this game.  One of them is the Star Date which simply counts down.  The other is a space battle between a beefy Klingon Bird of Prey and a rather wimpy Enterprise.    If the Enterprise gets kicked around too much then lots of bad things happen.

Well, my battle plan did not survive the opening teaser of this episode.   It started out with Kirk beaming down to pick up a Klingon Frequency Pad to boost the shields of the Enterprise.  But it was a trap and Kirk is immediately kidnapped by the rebels!  This is bad because while he is trapped the Star Date keeps ticking down.  Uhura must beam down to rescue him as soon as possible or else this is going to be a very short episode.  

Unfortunately the transporter is on the blink so she is stuck on the Enterprise and has to [b]wait[/b] until her next turn to beam down.  The transporters were flaky throughout the episode and this really hurt the team in the early going.   There was still no way for Kirk to free himself so all he could do was get Energize cards and [b]wait[/b] for rescue.

I tried to apply a rule of thumb I learned from [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37046/ghost-stories]Ghost Stories[/url]: don&#039;t roll the dice unless you don&#039;t need them or almost don&#039;t need them.   In GS, if you fail, you just lose an action but in ST:E you lose an action [i]and[/i] a health when you fail.    So Uhura beams down to get some Rebel Artifacts that should help her free Kirk.  Unfortunately, right after she leaves the ship the Klingons get their disrupter working so the Enterprise Shields are useless!    This is bad ...

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjL8WXjlGI]ROLL OPENING SEQUENCE[/url]:
[IMG]http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_640x430/public/TOSopeninglogo_5.png[/IMG]

Notice that every part of my initial strategy failed early on.  The Enterprise had become a sitting duck and Kirk was trapped and useless.  Uhura had to first free Kirk and then beam back up to the ship to find the correct shield frequencies to prevent an early demise of the Enterprise and the episode.    She had already assembled a team that was good at Operations to rescue Kirk and this same team would help her fix the shields to defeat the disrupter and save the Enterprise.

It was only after Uhura had put out all of these fires that the team could start to work on solving the 9 missions needed to win the game.  Unfortunately the episode was already halfway over.  Since many of the missions have a clock associated with them (they need to be completed before certain Star Dates) we solved almost every mission poorly which resulted in very few victory points.   After some missteps and other adventures, we were finally able to beef up the Enterprise and it could hold its ground against the Bird of Prey.  This was fortunate because we did so poorly on all the missions that if the Enterprise had been beaten back then the game would have been lost.   We were able to eek out a Pyrrhic victory: Nibia joined the Klingon Empire; civil war erupted with the rebels controlling central parts of the planet; and there were many deaths due to permanent damage to the ecosystem.

As I said, I really enjoyed it and I look forward to playing again.  I liked it much better than [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/194479/item/4100357#item4100357]solo Alien Frontiers[/url].

:thumbsup: It is relatively inexpensive now
:thumbsdown: This is partly due to the fact that it is unlikely there will ever be a &quot;real&quot; (mission) expansion for it.  Think of a very light [i]Eldritch Horror[/i] with no expansions.

:thumbsup: It has some very high quality components
:thumbsdown: The location cards are large and don&#039;t match a standard sleeve size.  I may  end up laminating them like the location tiles for [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/79127/star-trek-fleet-captains]Star Trek: Fleet Captains[/url].

:thumbsup: It&#039;s Star Trek!
:thumbsdown: ... The 2009 reboot that is.  I enjoy Trek but I am not a big fan so I don&#039;t really differentiate between the original and the reboot.  For me, the game played like an episode of TOS and didn&#039;t really correspond to the reboot.   If this matters to you then just don&#039;t look real closely at the images on the role cards.  Or use the fan-made [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107139/tos-cards-clix-values]TOS role cards[/url].

:thumbsdown: IMO Clix sucks.  I would much prefer clear bases.
:thumbsup: There are fan-made cards that have the Clix values so you don&#039;t need to use the adult-proof Clix bases.

[b]Notes:[/b]
Here is a [url=http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-trek/star-trek-09/]very long review[/url] comparing the reboot with the original.  It can be vulgar and offensive as well as insightful.   You might also want to look at the comparison in [url=https://www.claremont.org/article/the-politics-of-star-trek/]the Politics of Star Trek[/url].</body>

I would love to see a Bladerunner game too (and The Thing)! 

I realize Star Wars is actually a pretty lackluster series of movies (well, except for The Empire Strikes Back which is amazing), but I was the right age to be awestruck by it. My grandmother took me to see the first Star Wars (in the end about 6 times) the summer it was released, and 7-year-old me was blown away. For me the nostalgia makes critical thinking about Star Wars difficult. I am embarrassingly excited for the new release.

Star Trek was a fun diversion for me, but not my favourite of themes, although I am digging [thing=178613][/thing]. That is mostly for the gameplay though, the theme for me is pretty tacked on in the game. Although better a tacked on sci-fi theme than none at all, for me anyway.

Speaking of sci-fi that would make a fun game, I would also love to play a Planet of the Apes game!

Yeah, Planet of the Apes would be cool too, and possibly Stargate (based on the movie, not the TV series)

Star Trek was my late Father&#039;s favourite TV show, so it was inflicted on me in the sixties, except for the episode &#039;Trouble with Tribbles&#039; which is one of the funniest things I&#039;ve ever seen :D

In the late eighties we went to Orlando with my parents and in-laws. At one of the theme parks you could be filmed taking part in some scenes from Star Trek using green-screen. My father played Kirk and my Father in law played Spock and my Mum played Uhuru. It&#039;s on VHS and it&#039;s a cherished posession. I must get it transferred onto disc while it&#039;s still possible.

Kinda... but I want to actually play MacReady!

First I would equip the J&amp;B.

[imageid=2657450 large]

Then I would equip the sunglasses.

[imageid=2657460 large]

Then when the time came, I would put down the J&amp;B and the sunglasses, and equip the dynamite in one hand and a flamethrower in the other!

[imageid=2657483 large]

Then when I had used the dynamite, I would put down the flamethrower and finally re-equip the J&amp;B.

[imageid=2657488 large]

Can&#039;t do that in Dark Moon :p

I visited Woodhenge once (didn&#039;t realise about Durrington whatsit) and was amazed that there was no-one there at all considering how close it is to Stonehenge.  Not much there like but it&#039;s a nice spot.

	<body>So after a couple of dry runs of the intro mission, I think I am ready to start the campaign for real. In order to not clutter SGOYT with too many pictures (and to save some of your wallets, at least those of you who can resist clicking the link below), I have started a geeklist to track the campaign. The first mission is now posted:

[size=18][b][geeklist=196378]Heroes of the Aturi Cluster
[size=14]The Reverends Campaign Playthrough[/size][/geeklist][/b][/size]

[imageid=2657393 large]

Kelarin Undea has an interceptor hot on her tail!

How did it turn out? Click the geeklist name above to find out!</body>

[q=&quot;Lumpy75&quot;]I&#039;ve very keen to get this printed and onto the table.  Is there a summary of which ships are needed (and how many) somewhere?[/q]

Basically you need the following:

1 x Lambda Shuttle, Decimator, Tie Interceptor, Rebel Transport, 1 Hawk, 1 Millennium Falcon

Plus the following:

2 x tie fighters for each rebel ship (i.e. 2 for a 1 rebel ship playthrough, 4 for 2 rebel ships, etc.)
1 x tie bomber, tie defender, tie phantom, tie interceptor for each rebel ship

Keep in mind that in each mission some ships enter during later turns, so you will probably have killed Tie Fighter models that can be returned to the field.

The designer suggests that you can proxy for ships you don&#039;t have, or replace them with a ship you do, although that may affect the difficulty.

It is also possible to print out the AI cards and the Pilot cards and just use them to fight standard dogfights.

I am running a two rebel ship campaign. I am lucky that I have mostly collected Imperial ships as that is what I fly FtF. I think I have enough ships currently to run a three-person campaign.

	<body>Mission 2: After a few weeks of sitting on my table, I finally had a chance to replay it using the same 3 heroes. 

3 hours! I don&#039;t believe it was my tactics but I was horribly trounced and the time limit was severely passed. I pressed on to the 20th round and then gave up (whereas it overstayed its welcome). My paladin was KO&#039;d 3 times and my Gnome once in the end. There were a lot of tough decisions throughout and I had had some pretty awesome combos when the characters were all beefed up.

It was fun but horribly disappointing to lose by such a large margin. The monsters posed a huge overwhelming problem when they came at you, each with differing abilities. Perhaps 4-5 characters will be the sweet spot for this scenario?

I will try again but I have to question the design when playing this scenario with only 3 characters.

Unfortunately, I have to leave this beast of a game for awhile because it left a bad taste in my mouth.

My sense after playing is that the time you are given is way too short.  It actually hurts the game, because you don;t have time to do cool things like loot barrels.

I agree. I will try the same scenario once more with 4 peeps and see how far I get.

With some tweaks, this game can be awesome! The death of a character should be penalized more than just a time slip.

	<body>Played this five times over the weekend.

I played PBF #4-8 from this great geeklist: [geeklist=191896][/geeklist]

If you want more detail of how I did head over there.  If you want to play Limes solo against other people then head there as well.  Mo has put together some great challenges.

I scored a personal best of 51 using the 17th card variant in my first game and then scored a whopping 58 using the Lighthouse variant in my third game.  My other three scores were 45, 46 and 48.

I was then able to rank it as part of my project to find my [geeklist=189816]Top 20 Solo Games[/geeklist].

Here&#039;s what I wrote about my thoughts after those 5 plays:

[q][b]Thoughts after 5 plays:[/b] I&#039;m wrong. This is a top 20 game. I expect it to hang on in there and just about make my top 20. It is a great little puzzle and after playing 5 games of it using a few of the variants I have to say that replayability is good too. I&#039;ve stated that Adventure of D is my favourite 15-20 minute game but I may be wrong. It&#039;s just a high score game which I normally dislike but this continues to make me forget that. Box could be smaller though.[/q]
:thumbsup: A great little puzzle of a game that is different every time and the variants just add to the replayability.

:thumbsdown: A high score game so that won&#039;t be for everyone - it shouldn&#039;t be for me!

:thumbsdown: It&#039;s a smallish box but it could still be much smaller, say the size of the Harbour box.</body>

This has been my most played game this year with 41 plays so far.  I haven&#039;t begun to tire of it yet either.  Just a really fun puzzle of a game.  

But I agree - the box could be much smaller.

I travel with the cards, meeples, and a small version of the instructions in a small bag.  But I can&#039;t bring myself to toss the box.

Shucks, I was hoping it was a small box (as this will soon be on my shelf).  I can&#039;t toss boxes either.  Cheapo expansion boxes maybe (although I still have some sitting there waiting to be chucked) but quality ones... haven&#039;t done it yet.  May get desperate to at some point.

The box did come in useful on holiday though as I was able to store 3 other games in it.

The box itself is &quot;small&quot;, but relative to what is in it - way too big.

	<body>[b]Print On Demand #1: The Massing at Osgiliath[/b]

Deck 1: Eowyn, Dunhere, Prince Imrahil
Deck 2: Beravor, Gimli, Legolas

Well this was one hell of a quest to start back on after a few months away! I heard that this was hard and it didn&#039;t disappoint with six enemies in the staging area before the quest had even started.

The first few rounds were very shaky. A lack of allies meant that by the time the initial onslaught of enemies had been dealt with the heroes were all injured and down to 1 or 2 hit points left. Progress was slow in attempting to cross the Anduin.

Suddenly the tide turned when Legolas gained the Steward of Gondor and Beravor a Song of Battle resulting in a plethora of eagle allies and support cards joining the fight.

Having not read the quest cards the requirement to discard a hero or ranger to be able to quest came as a bit of a shock. Thankfully one of the rangers had already joined out party and the other made an appearance straight after starting to cross the Anduin. However, both were on the more combat  orientated player deck. With no enemies in sight the heroes successfully crossed the river... only to face the Witch-king.

This turned out to not be a problem as by now Gimli was a defending monster! Two Unexpected Courage, Support Of The Eagles (which allowed him to add +4 to defense or attack) and a Citadel Plate meant that he was able to deal with anything thrown at him and it wasn&#039;t long before the heroes were in the safety of Minas Tirith.

Result: [b][COLOR=#00CC00]Success![/COLOR][/b]
Final Score: [b]174[/b]

Thoroughly enjoyed playing this quest and it certainly got the pulse racing a few times when defeat looked inevitable. Would have been nice to defeat the Witch-king. I had the attack to do it but the requirement to raise the defending players threat by 3 to keep them engaged would have knocked them out. But now, onward to Moria...</body>

Testing has revealed which cards I&#039;m really looking for in my opening hand. Not unsurprising Vilya and Gandalf&#039;s staff are what I&#039;m looking for but word of command has often been my MVP so far.

The biggest issue for this deck has been an early enemy rush which happened on my first attempt through Mirkwood with this deck almost making me dispatch the deck all together. Every single encoounter draw in the first 5 turns was a spider or Orc... Happy to have stuck with it though and a blast to play :)</body>

Of course I now see this isn&#039;t the complete list I ended up with. There were some late changes to it.

With 3 Word of Command I added 1* Asfaloth and 1* Burning Brand but I&#039;m not sure what I removed. 1 Shadowfax is enough at least.

	<body>I picked this up yesterday to scratch an itch for a quick dice game with some decision making. I was looking for something to play when my brain is fried after a day&#039;s work, but that is more engaging than solitaire.

This was my first play, but my initial impressions are positive. It made me think more than I expected, but not so much that I can&#039;t play it after a particularly challenging day at the office. This was a nice surprise. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how it holds up in the replayability department. From looking at some of the designer&#039;s comments in some of the threads on the BGG game page, it looks like an expansion might be in the works to help with this though.

I ended up with a score of 22 for my first play, which I am satisfied with. At least I did better than Dan Quayle! :)</body>

I have played about 20 games on yucata.de so far, 2/3/4 players and so far my scores have ranged between 18 and 36 (you don&#039;t get ranked other than yucata&#039;s system).

There is a fair amount of luck both in what tiles are available on your turn and what you roll on your dice, but it is good lite fun.

I can get a gauge of how &quot;luck based&quot; a game is when I play against my girlfriend. She tends to beat me most of the time when we play. A game like Run, Fight or Die is clearly luck based because we each win about half the time. Nations: The Dice Game, however, she beats me a good 70% of the time, so while luck is involved, strategy is clearly important!

Actually, on checking, I&#039;ve already finished 50 games on yucata, winning 20 of them. Bearing in mind they&#039;re equally split between 2/3/4 player games that equates to a roughly 50% strike rate for bested opponents.

Strategy is required to mitigate dice rolls and tile options IMHO.

	<body>I played my first two games of this since May.

My first game was a quick victory on Bacterial level just to remind me of the rules/gameplay.  I managed to win after just 9 rounds (as quick as I ever have) mainly due to the extra funding on this level and the mutations going in my favour too.

Time to step it up to Viral level.

This time it wasn&#039;t over quickly and it was epic.

The game lasted 21 rounds (my longest ever) and I came so close to winning and completing all the molecules (never done that before).

In round 20 I had to roll a 6 on the containment check to give me a chance of getting the 2 proteins I needed next round. I did it! Yay!

When refreshing the protein pool though I drew neither of the proteins I needed.  I then bought a lab equipment card card that allowed me to change all the proteins if I rolled a 4-6.  Rolled a 3.  Then I needed to roll a 6 to have yet another round.

[ImageID=2657830 medium]I didn&#039;t roll a 6.

Two vastly different games with different feels.  The first was a quick luck driven game and the second was very tactical with me adapting to what was happening as the game went on and on.  

Luck played a part in the second game too (I set a record for rolling 6&#039;s on containment rolls) but it was how I used that extra time and how I ordered all my actions to maximise my turns that really had me enjoying the experience.  I felt like I was in a lab under growing pressure to get things done as the world slowly succumbed to the virus. 

I&#039;d forgotten how entertaining this could be and how thematic.

:thumbsup: Thematic and when it&#039;s not over too quickly it can be a pressure cooker of an experience (in a good way).

:thumbsdown: It uses dice rolls for certain checks and they can sometimes be a little swingy. 

:thumbsdown: The cards need sleeving.</body>

Have you tried the unofficial Overtime Without Pay Viral variant? It can mitigate the luck of die rolls:

I decided to play the viral game without it this time but I usually play with it. I do recommend playing with it.

It can help a bit but I tend to go for the money every time anyway. :shake:

	<body>Finally I was able to beat the first mission on Agent Decker.

Last friday I decided that it was time to give Decker the skills he needs to be a great spy. With a new strategy, I started to get my self the cards I need to improve my deck, mixing this with KOing dangerous cards that would set the alarm in high levels. Succeeded it and start the second mission.

Starting with a improved deck gets things easier. Since I already had the two [i]Interrogate[/i] cards (&quot;draw two cards&quot;) there were turns where it was easy to get stronger hands. Keeping this in mind, my first goal was to buy [i]Gear Up[/i] to be able to draw even more cards and [i]Recall[/i] was also another great purchase. Beat the mission and went to the next one.

The third went very smooth and it was kind of easy to beat it. But then at the end I noticed a mistake that probably made things easier: I forgot the effect of the [i]Dormitory[/i] card (it says that only the face up cards slide to the right). Since I wasn&#039;t sure if it was too relevant or not, I decided to continuing with the game.

At the fourth mission (which I completed it very fast with the alarm at 9), I made a combo that allowed me to end that mission so fast that I felt weird. That&#039;s when I noticed the biggest mistake I did: I forgot the the limit of 3 cards from [i]Gear Up[/i]&#039;s effect (I drew 6 cards in the last combo). After that I remembered that in the last turn on the previous mission I drew 4 cards that ended the mission. By this time I decided to end the game since I was already very wrong...

So the final score was:
  - Mission 1, Alarm 43
  - Mission 2, Alarm 35
  - Mission 3, Alarm 36.</body>

I think it&#039;s worth to print it. Easy, few cards and entertained.
I don&#039;t know how I&#039;m going to feel after solve the five mission, but right now I really want to beat them.

It&#039;s a great game and well worth the effort of printing and cutting.

While the rules are fairly clear, some of the card effects could do with more explanation... but definitely worth a shot.

Like you, on my last play through I managed to get to Mission 4 before setting off the alarm.

	<body>I listen to a lot of audiobooks in the car, and for the past several months, I&#039;ve been listening to &quot;The Rise and the Fall of the Third Reich&quot; (Amazon link: http://goo.gl/MvUH7q) so needless to say I&#039;ve been pretty engrossed in WWII history.  And then reading about so many wargames on this list, and elsewhere, has me longing to add my first wargame to my collection.  

There are a number of popular wargames played were, and it seems like most of them are out of print and/or very expensive.  I don&#039;t normally like dice games, but I am warming up to them (and my son likes to chuck dice, so that helps warm me as well) and as long as there&#039;s luck-mitigation and choices, dice are okay.

So put all those ingredients into the pot and stir it up and what do you get?  I started looking for D-Day Dice.  I found it in good condition for under $30 shipped on http://boardgameco.com/ for under $30, but didn&#039;t jump on it fast enough and then next available copies shot up to $45 shipped.  A day before I had seen a deal on eBay for both the base game and the Atlantik Wall expansion, so without hesitation after losing the first deal, I jumped on it.

I played a number of training missions, losing time and time again, finally figured out that I needed to take it slowly and build up as many men as possible before advancing too far.  Finally played the full-on Exercise Tiger scenario and won!  

Bunker: 20
First in bunker: 20
Last Sector: 10*10=100
Soldiers: 13
Courage: 0
Specialists: 2*3=6
Awards: 1*10=10
Total: 169

The first 140 points is a gimme in the solo game, so I guess the 29 points I scored after that is what really matters.

I&#039;m excited the flip the map over and lose repeatedly on the second mission before finally defeating that bunker!

I do still think there&#039;s a WWII-themed hex-and-counter solo wargame in my future, but for now I will stick with the dice.

This was my first sort-of wargame too (what can I say, I love dice).  I&#039;m ready to try a hex and counter wargame but I&#039;m not sure where to start, and I also am not sure about playing it around my cat... might have to play it at the SO&#039;s place which means leaving it set up for more than a day or two wouldn&#039;t be appreciated.

Not remembering the first map precisely off the top of my head, I would say only the first 90 points were a given for a solo win - you could have entered the bunker from sector 9 right?

Dice, you know I&#039;ll be getting Conflict of Heroes soon? We can use that as your first hex/counter game. There&#039;s also DDay At Omaha Beach that plays 2p (or DD at Tarawa if you give that a go with the Reverend).

This week I am planning on picking up [thing=13709][/thing], a WWI hex/counter/chit pull game that is possible to play in one session, and gets great reviews. I also have Panzer Grenadier: Road to Berlin which is amazing but takes several sessions to finish. I developed a &quot;cat-protection&quot; system that you might be interested in. I picked up some plexiglass sheets from a local art supply store (mostly to cover/flatten my paper maps while playing), but I discovered that with some support to raise one over the game board, I can cover the play area and prevent the cats from getting at it!

[ImageID=2643024 large]

As you can see from this photo, I used my counter trays to raise the plexiglass high enough to get over the dice/chits. The plexi has enough weight that my cats can&#039;t move it easily, in fact I found one of them sitting on the plexiglass staring at the game, but she couldn&#039;t seem to figure out how to get under and screw things up :D

I am hoping to break away from my Star Wars campaign today and get a play of D-Day Dice in. Will let you know what I think.

Yeah, I like the game, but it&#039;s pretty light in terms of being a &quot;wargame&quot; and it will scratch the itch for now, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have to go bigger/more complex in the near future.

Yes, that&#039;s the only variable in the &quot;gimme points&quot; - could have entered from sector 9.  Actually advanced into sector 9 and moved laterally into 10 because I needed to use a tool to reduce the damage level.  (Can&#039;t use tools in sector 9)

Alright, I guess we&#039;ll have to find time for one of these!  Especially Conflict of Heroes sounds short enough.  The others we might have start after brunch.

I haven&#039;t trained my cat to stay off the table while I&#039;m using it :(  He&#039;ll walk all over it while I&#039;m actively trying to play.

	<body>While in San Francisco last week for a conference, I was able to get over to Gamescape, a game store on Divisadero St. Very cool store!

They had a copy of Baseball Highlights: 2045 Deluxe Edition in stock, so I picked it up.

I didn&#039;t really get a chance to play it until last night after getting back home on Saturday. Man, how cool is this game?!?

I played 2 Series, once as NY and once as SF with 2 buy rounds in each. I won the first Series (NY) 4-2; lost the second Series (SF) 4-1. Started to setup another series when I glanced at the clock and saw 2:57 am. :surprise:

There is so much more to this game than meets the eye, IMHO. It looks simple and it is in the sense that it is easy to learn, but there is depth in the decisions to be made, both during play and during the buy rounds.

I have high expectations for playing against a real person as well!

SO GLAD I picked this up.

[b]Update:[/b] Got two more series in today, both with Boston. Lost both, neither closer than 4-2. I need to get better at watching what the AI has and thinking ahead as to what is coming between shuffles...</body>

	<body>Thought I&#039;d give this another play using the basic rules before stepping up to the advance stuff. Nice enjoyable game, plays quick (at basic level anyway). Very easy print and play, one of my first (the others being pen and paper style games require only the rules printing).

Wasn&#039;t very well liked at the start ...[imageid=2658004]

But after a few years clearing the debt, I was able to spend a bit more increasing my popularity along the way until,

	<body>This was one of the first kickstarters I backed, and it&#039;s been sitting on a shelf unpunched since I received long ago. So I decided to unpunch it and give it a try this long holiday weekend.

It looks good, and has lots of cards and other components. The rule book is clearer than some. But once I got into the game I found myself looking for answers to questions and not finding them or maybe just not knowing where to look.

As a solo game I found it a bit dull. It&#039;s technically a co-op game, with opportunity for backstabbing and other player interaction. It might be more fun with multiple players.

I don&#039;t think I will hang onto it. For me, Castle Panic scratches a similar itch, albeit from the other side, but seems more fun as a solo game (and also a game I can get non-gamers to play on the rare occasion I have a chance).

Storm the Castle isn&#039;t a bad game. It just doesn&#039;t do it for me personally.</body>

I have this as well. I still can&#039;t really decide about it. I get the feeling it&#039;s a much better semi co-op game than a straight co-op. Which of course means it isn&#039;t at it&#039;s best as a solo game. I guess you could play each side in a semi-co-op mode, but the auctions are awkward.

I don&#039;t think it is for solo play. But I like Castle Panic (with Wizard&#039;s Tower) and have never played Stronghold, so you may not trust my opinion.

	<body>I wasn&#039;t planning on adding this so as to keep up the guise that I&#039;m only playing Conflict of Heroes, however, I feel the need to sing its praises a bit. I big time cheated and moved my table overlay to the bed where I will keep CoH set up all month and try to play a round or two at every sitting.

Dice Masters, though, MAN. The variant is really good and I think I&#039;m actually starting to develop some general strategy. I play with everything randomized since there aren&#039;t enough villains in the set and my last few plays have all been pretty close. I had a dramatic finish last round when I was down 4-2 and came back for the win.

:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Theme. I&#039;m not going to argue that this is a great Marvel-themed experience. I bet Legendary gives a better Marvel flavor. But  the more I play with certain characters, the more I feel the theme come through. Hopefully this will increase over time.

:thumbsup: Theme aside, the tension of the conflict is all there. The ebb and flow of a good brawl is present for sure.

:thumbsdown: My current collection is small, but would provide endless combos of satisfying matchups. This is a thumbs down because despite this, I still want to buy the little packs.</body>

I have a big stack of extra cards and dice (from booster packs) from the Age of Ultron set.  You can definitely play any of the comic book themed Dice Masters sets together.  Let me know if want me to send them to you.  They are just collecting dust here at my house...

Perhaps a swap of some sort is in order. I certainly don&#039;t need 4 Emma Frost - Archvillain cards. I think I have 5 or 6 redundant character cards, but no dice counts above 4 yet.

I also have the A vs. X starter and was pretty bummed, though not surprised, that the Storm dice, for instance, were different. I understand for the collector&#039;s you&#039;d want a distinction, but... bleh.

This stack of Age of Ultron extras isn&#039;t much to get excited about, it&#039;s not even very good math trade fodder.  It doesn&#039;t round out your X-Men set, but would give you other comic book themed characters to add to the fun.  Anyway, if you want them, they are all yours.  :)

If you&#039;re not planning to do anything else with them, sure! I don&#039;t see myself getting into multiple sets. Probably just keep to X-men and then whatever other little additives I want to throw in.

I&#039;ll send you a GM.

	<body>After my previous disaster with trying to lure Edward out, I went back to playing against Arkayne. This time, I thought I would change from my strategy of keeping him calm before he gives up to something a bit more risky.

This time round, I went to build as many conversation points as I could in order to purchase the larger value cards. This was working quite well, and I took a couple of chances at a Minor Extraction, which got some of the hostages out.

I wanted to have a go at getting the hostages out quickly, but calmed him down first to get another dice. At this stage, he was calm enough to coax him out, so rather than take further risks, I made him surrender...

	<body>I got this last week and I already played it 6 or 7 times.
When I first got the game, the box looked smaller than expected. Then, after setting my first game up, I was surprised by the amount of space needed on the table.

[imageid=2658169medium]

I also cut the top of the 3D towers off, the board is huge and you can&#039;t see anything behind them and can&#039;t move anything. Even in a 4 player game the others had to read everything out loud again and again until we just moved the towers out of the way when we had to move/attack with monsters at that tower.

Anyway. After a couple of tries, solo and with friends now and having lost every single time, I decided to set it up again tonight for a three character game.

[imageid=2658177medium]

[i]Valcor,[/i] the fighter! Ready to slay his enemies and protect his allys by tanking everything that came his way, self-sacrificing and probably not too smart.
[i]Ember[/i], the archer! Quick to draw and quick to fire. Raining arrows down on enemies till they resemble a pincushion. From the safety of the tower, she&#039;s brave and safe.
And then we had [i]Boleslaw[/i]. The weird, strange kid who nobody wanted to be friends with and was always up to no good. He lurked in the tower, never leaving them, making flying monsters drop from the sky or slowing them down for Valcor to kill them.

The archer&#039;s really good on one tower, basically killing everything coming her way in wave 1 and 2 without any problems. Valcor tanks and kills everything coming his way and healing up between waves without any problems (at least in the frist few waves).
I&#039;ve never played Boleslaw before which is the main reason why I decided to pick him. He can never leave the tower but can teleport to another tower and has some nice surprises for the monsters and can help a lot. I hope.

The first wave of monster appears:

The heroes looked at the goblins and orc and laughed. That was hardly worth their time! Valcor just let the goblin walk up to him and held his sword ready. The poor creature practically skewered and killed itself! The archer was having a great time doing target practice. And just like that, it was over. Easy. Way too easy!
But who cares, we got the gold! Showing foresight, which does not happen too often, a cleric was drafted and joined our ranks. A healer! There were more monsters coming and sooner or later we were bound to receive some wounds.

Then the next wave of monsters appeared:
[imageid=2658202medium]

A siege engine! That stirred everyone up for a second but it moved so slowly, every monster who tried to hurry it along was quickly killed that it didn&#039;t prove to be a threat at all!
Quickly, every foe was vanguished and the heroes looked at each other, underwhelmed. That was an easy job they were hired for apparently. Which was alright for them!

The cleric got some experience from the fight and was better able to wield his abilites and Valcor bought a net to catch flying monsters. 

So far things were looking good, but the heroes could already hear another batch of monsters assembling in the forest, making their way to the dwarven gate.


[size=18][b]update: wave 3![/b][/size]

8 foes appeared. Two siege engines again! And one flying monster. I had Valcor, the fighter and tank positioned to the east with the cleric, the other three were all on the western tower or in front of it.
Only two monsters decided to go for Valcor. A measly goblin (Level 1) and a flying monster. But Valcor had his net ready, catching it and dragging it to the ground!
The others tanked two monsters, the siege engines were really slow and only came towards the end, the last monster was ignored. It tried to attack my hired swordsman but missed.
Valcor quickyl dispatched of his foes (with a critical hit and never missing one of his other rolls) and was ready to rush to the aid of the others.
All things considered that was one of the easiest Level 3 Waves I&#039;ve ever had! And all thanks to Boleslaw!
His ability to make primary attacks supernatural damage was key to it! Valcor destroyed one siege engine alone in just one round! He hit critically, which meant 10 damage to it. The rest was easy!

With the rewards, I bought a third tower, a reinforcement card that, when used, gives all my allies 2 extra actions this turn and decided to keep the rest of the gold for a future round, maybe buying an armory card after next wave.

Really great to see how all the different abiliies work together! Buffing Valcors damage to 5 and making it supernatural made Boleslaw the hero of this wave!


So far, I really really like that game! A few years ago, I played a lot of tower defence games on my computer, this game does a wonderfull job in bringing that to the table!

There&#039;s 7 heroes which all play very differently. Archer, sorcerer, cleric, tank, fighter, summoner, supporter... everything&#039;s here. And, depending on what you decide to play, you can later on hire allies to fullfill roles you didn&#039;t pick. Which is a great idea. They begin at level 1 and can go up to level 3, getting more actions and better spells/attacks.
What nearly made me back this (which I now regrett not having done) was the adjustable player count on top of all this. You start playing, a friend comes over and wants to join? No problem, just adjust the number of monsters for the next wave and the rewards. Someone has to leave? No problem, same applies. This is really neat.
If I keep playing this game that much, I&#039;ll have to try and get the kickstarter items from somewhere! It only left my table once during this week, when we played it at a friends place. Set it up again the very next day.

You can also make different maps for the monsters to take. A single path map usually is easier, make it a winding path and you make it very easy on yourself. Or make it harder, let them go in two directions and lead them straight to the castle doors.
A lot of thought has gone into this game. It really shows.

I&#039;m not too keen on some of the rules, like the starting equipment cards. Every hero gets two of them, but they are locked. You have to unlock them first, because those are only the two items the dwarves are willing to sell to you at the moment. After that, you can draw from the deck. But I have to admit, at least you know what you&#039;ll get for the first two cards and you can choose if it&#039;s worth it to you or not.

And then there&#039;s the thematic rules, which, admittedly, I still tend to forget sometimes. They are just there so you won&#039;t break the game in some situations. For instance, you only have one enemy left and don&#039;t kill him until the healer has healed everybody back to full health.
You were hired to protect the castle and its your job to kill the monsters. So you have to attack at least once or move closer to them to try and attack or prepare an attack.
For me, it wasn&#039;t a problem yet, I don&#039;t think I did anything wrong this last time.

The game itself is not that hard, the rules aren&#039;t that difficult usually, but there&#039;s always that one exception for me that I forget. But nothing mayor and not to my advantage. I think.


:thumbsup: Adjustable player count! Awesome! Lets others join or leave with clear rules so the game&#039;s still balanced!
:thumbsup: Great replayability!
:thumbsup: Without good strategy, you&#039;ll loose. Guaranteed.

:thumbsdown: Still, rolling a die. So there&#039;s quite some luck involved, too, of course
:thumbsdown: The 3D towers. They block the view. I cut 2 towers down and thats an improvement. But they still look really cheap. I&#039;d have loved some thick cardboard like in Legends of Andor.

[b]Wave 4 + 5:[/b]

[b]Wave 4[/b] went relativley easy. Boleslows ability to make someone else do supernatural damage and increasing it by +1 really made a difference. The archer was able to fire supernatural arrows and killed a lot of monsters.
Valcor hacked his way through his foes. The cleric was busy healing the foot soldier who nearly got killed but made it through the wave!

I decided to buy 2 more reinforcement cards, giving me three of them now in total,  since I didn&#039;t need another ally and couldn&#039;t afford the armory card anyway. Which turned out great for me!

[b]Wave 5:[/b]
Wave 5 is then the boss monsters appears, too. But in the first turn, only the monsters appear and attack. 12 monsters... the hired foot soldier was close to death after they all appeared. Playing one of my reinforcement cards that gave everyone 2 extra actions this turn proved to be a livesafer.
Valcor killed two foes, the hired footsoldier wounded one, Ember, my archer, killed one foe instantly and took another down with him. The cleric used the extra actions to heal that unlucky footsoldier up.
Then the monster moved again. After that second movement, the boss appeared. The Boss appeared in form of a giant rolling boulder!
It was pushed by an Ettin and would smash right through the doors of the castle!
In the first round though, it smashed right through my unlucky footsoldier, flattening him and crushing his bones beneath it!
Full of wrath, Valcor and Ember slew the Ettin pushing the boulder, the cleric was intelligent enough to move out of the way and tanking another foe instead.

But two runners made it to the gate, I decided to let them go. They tried to blow it up but I played another reinforcement card that allowed me to heal the gate for 7 HP. So that was alright!

I finally managed to kill every other foe and soon only the giant boulder was left. I chipped away at it (again, Boleslaws ability was amazing, because the boulder would have been immun to Embers arrows otherwise) and soon had it reduced to rubble!

Victory was mine!


First game I won and I was lucky with some of my rolls. Ember headshotting two foes, instantly killing them was great. That was fun!

Great report!

Are you aware of the rule that you can only have 3 reinforcement cards at a time?

Thanks, Moe.

And, uhm, no. I wasn&#039;t, thanks for pointing that out. But I didn&#039;t buy three more cards, I bought two more cards, making it three total. So I still should be fine, I think.
Need to correct that in the text, thanks! I managed to survive with three HP left on the gate and everything killed, only thanks to the reinforcement cards. I checked the armory card I drew, which would&#039;ve been nice, too, the sonic shockwave generator, dealing 2 non-resistable damage to every foe at the start of each players&#039; round. I should&#039;ve saved up some more....

	<body>Had a bit of time to spare, so I gave this one another go.

Played the two player game, with two Samurai and the one use additions of the remaining support tokens.

Rounds 1 and 2 went well, but then a ridiculous decision by me cost the game. I decided that my wounded Samurai (on his animal side) would fight for another round to draw a card away from the Raider deck. Of course, the next round he died losing the game. If I&#039;d passed, there were only four cards left in the Raider deck and five Farmsteads, so I would have won!</body>

	<body>This has been on the table a lot lately - I&#039;m up to 7-8 full plays, mostly with two characters and once with three. I&#039;ve played The Abomination and Tangled Paths scenarios and have used each character at least once.

[ImageID=2640035 medium]

I&#039;m really, really liking this game. The variety in characters is nice - there are definitely a couple that I have yet to figure out how to use to their full abilities, like Hareag - and I&#039;ve figured out the strategy well enough that I can reliably win on the basic difficulty level. The rules have become second nature; I don&#039;t think I needed to look at the rulebook more than a couple times during my most recent playthrough. The errata is still a bit of a bother, but most every game has errata and this certainly isn&#039;t any worse than, say, the first iteration of the PACG series ([thing=133038]Rise of the Runelords[/thing] had a ton of errata and that didn&#039;t stop me from enjoying it).

[ImageID=2657908 medium]

I really liked my 3-handed play of Tangled Paths - I played with Ardenai, Fengray and Hareag. The variety of abilities made for some fun strategies and combos, particularly with Fengray pulling as many enemies into his area as possible and Ardenai picking them off at range. I&#039;ve seen some criticisms that the card combos are a bit too obvious and get repetitive, but I haven&#039;t experienced that yet (maybe I&#039;m just not smart enough to figure them out that quickly).

[ImageID=2657909 medium]

I would definitely like to see more quests - I&#039;ll probably start replaying some of these at higher difficulty levels but I&#039;m not sure how long that will hold my interest. So I guess what I&#039;m really saying is, if and when there are expansions published, they&#039;ll be auto-buys for me :)

[ImageID=2654566 medium]

Long story short, if you don&#039;t mind purely deterministic combat, i.e. you like Mage Knight-style puzzles instead of (or along with) PACG-style dicefests, this is probably a game that will work for you.</body>

I nearly backed this. Then I decided it wasn&#039;t for me despite the theme that I usually love. I watched a few runthroughs, the theme seemed right up my alley but they all made it look so boring.
But since the Mage Knight comments keep popping up, I might have to reconsider *sighs*

Out of curiosity - what made it look boring to you? I could see some being turned off by the deterministic combat, but I&#039;m assuming that if the Mage Knight comparisons are a draw for you, that&#039;s not the problem.

To be fair, Mistfall zooms in on only one part of Mage Knight - the combat. The exploration and all the different things you can do in MK (recruit, pillage, attack different kinds of fortifications, etc) aren&#039;t there in Mistfall. But the combat is a lot more detailed as a result.

I watched Rhados runthrough, not the extended one though. I remember I was watching it while hoping that I wouldn&#039;t like it, just to save on some money, so that might have actually played a big part of why I thought it was boring. And I was trying to cut back on kickstarter projects.

I remember him playing a healer/cleric? And losing a card, talking about having to either put it back on top or at the bottom and how great that is.
In Mage Knight, you have the complete package, along with exploration, movement and combat, so if that would only be reduced to combat, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d still like it that much.

I love the fantasy setting normally, but even with everything I read, I&#039;m not sure if I need it. I will try and play it in Essen this year to either confirm that it just isn&#039;t for me or cave in and get it eventually :)

	<body>I played Omaha Beach twice this afternoon. I&#039;m pretty new to the game and it&#039;s been about a month since I played. I won 1st game, though messed up on &#039;can&#039;t stay here&#039; rule in Sector 3, so I&#039;m not really counting it since I don&#039;t know if I really would have won if I&#039;d played correctly.

The second game was legit, however. I worked my way up the right side and won with 177VP.

I need to get this out more regularly - it&#039;s quickly becoming one of my favorites!</body>

	<body>I played the computer version of this game a lot and decided a few months ago to pick up the physical edition.

The solitaire game is OK, but there is a lot of &quot;bookkeeping&quot; that the computer program took care of.  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable solo game and I really hope to get in a 2 player game someday.  The solo rules are a bit different from the multiplayer game.

Playing the basic game I got 126 points.</body>

It&#039;s set up on my table(s) ready to go for tomorrow when the kids are at school.

First game of it in 6 months.

I&#039;m a teeny bit excited. 

I think I might cry.

The first attempt at China Shop went as expected. I didn&#039;t even get through Stage 1.

[imageid=2659313 medium]
The second attempt went really well. I managed to get both Stage 2 and 3 open and both my COGs were healthy and had reasonable cards in their hands.

Then it all went wrong. Marcus got swarmed by wretches and had no guard cards so took a few wounds. Marcus was able to take a couple out through an attack and a guard action only for the remaining wretches to swarm them again and Augustus was left bleeding out.

Marcus made a desperate grab for the Hammer of Dawn and brought it to bear on the Berserker.

[imageid=2659314 medium]
The dice were rolled.

[imageid=2659315 medium]
6 wounds to the Berserker but not enough to kill it. However, the Omen that was rolled caused 2 wounds to Marcus.

[imageid=2659316 medium]
He could only take 1.

I&#039;m going set up another scenario as I can&#039;t face this again so soon. The pain is too raw. :cry:

Decided to try Damon Baird and Dominic Santiago against the Roadblocks scenario (never tried it before).

It didn&#039;t go well.

[imageid=2659416 medium]Dominic&#039;s last stand

My dice rolls were horrendous and the AI card that kept removing ammo tokens was painful.

In the end I probably played a bit too conservatively and when the dice rolls abandoned me I was left fighting multiple enemies too many times.

I decided to call it a day there. 3 plays in one day is a record I think.

:thumbsup: I love the way the gameplay is driven by the cards in your hand. Turns have to be thought through carefully.

:thumbsdown: Dice based combat can be a bit of a lottery.

:thumbsdown: Too few scenarios and no longer supported by FFG.</body>

	<body>My first play of this expansion and first time in this series playing solo. Great game!

Played easy mode/setting. Bot started off by quickly grabbing the 6 cost development card and kept a rather large pile of cards throughout the game. I was behind in points most of the game but did have a few good point cards in my tableau towards the end. I also started working the x2 Consume once I got some goods on a regular basis.
End game had me thinking I had lost this one; however, the final score put us at a tie score of 30 - 30. Tiebreaker went in my favor as I had 10 cards in hand and 1 good; Bot had 8 points.

:thumbsup: Bot is a challenging opponent (I can&#039;t even imagine trying the Hard level of play)

:thumbsup: Great, fun game!

:thumbsdown: Keeping track of various card abilities can be a little tricky (didn&#039;t have to worry about this with Keldon&#039;s AI)......</body>

	<body>After playing a ton of [thing=142875]The Black Riders[/thing] recently, I got back into the regular adventure cycles for the LotR LCG, continuing my chronological play-through with The Voice of Isengard. I got trounced by the first scenario, The Fords of Isen, with a pre-constructed hobbit deck that was totally unprepared for the new mechanics that punish you for having lots of cards in your hand. In response I crafted the below Spirit/Lore dual-sphere deck, which is optimized to have as few cards in hand as possible.

It&#039;s built around Elrond/Vilya (which can put cards into play directly from the deck, without them being in hand), Eowyn (whose ability can discard cards from the hand to add to her willpower), and Spirit Glorfindel (who is, well, Spirit Glorfindel). It has basically no events - the rationale being that events tend to stick around in hand until the moment they&#039;re needed, which is Bad News for this quest. The only event here is Elrond&#039;s Counsel, a zero-cost card that can be beneficially played at almost any time.

Spirit and Lore don&#039;t have much in the way of combat abilities, so I splashed in a few Tactics allies who can be paid for by Elrond or simply put into play with Vilya. Most cards in the deck are low-cost so I can put them into play ASAP. The high-cost allies (Beorn, Gildor Inglorion, Northern Tracker, Gandalf) can be either played via Vilya or discarded via Eowyn if I can&#039;t afford to pay for them.

Results? Beat all three Voice of Isengard scenarios with this one, including an utter demolition of Into Fangorn, which I managed to win in four turns. To Catch an Orc was a bit trickier with this deck, because the optimization is all wrong (the &quot;hand hate&quot; mechanic isn&#039;t present and more card draw would be helpful), but I still won 1 out of 2 tries.

Here&#039;s the deck...

	<body>So, I thought I&#039;d try to have a couple of nice relaxing solo games tonight.  Turns out, I must be a glutton for punishment.

First up, the [thing=42776][/thing] scenario &quot;China Shop&quot;.  Running from a giant Berserker that is completely immune to all of my weapons... sounds easy enough, right?

[ImageID=2658970 medium]

Marcus and Dominic quickly made a mad dash for the door at the end of the first level, easily gunning down any Drones in their way.

[ImageID=2658999 medium]

However, Marcus was mortally wounded early on in a horde of Wretches (oh, and the big-ass Berserker) only to have his faithful, trusty sidekick Dominic leave him in the dust (and blood... oh so much blood) to fend for himself.  He managed to pitifully crawl a few extra feet with a dying smirk on his face while karma caught up to Dominic and the inevitable ensued.

[ImageID=2658997 medium]

Oh well.  Next...

	<body>After that crushing defeat with [thing=42776][/thing], I might as well try something a little lighter to help build my confidence.  Of course, instead I pulled out [thing=28829][/thing].  Being only my second time playing, I thought I would try out the Ghost Division campaign again.  Now that I&#039;m comfortable with the rules and the counters, I&#039;m not referencing the rulebook as often and the game plays even quicker... especially when I get demolished.

By the end of the 4th round or so, I was starting to feel pretty good about myself.  I had managed to move forces steadily to the west, quickly taking and holding Paris and then even Cambrai, followed by Arras!  Woohoo, 2/3rds of the way there, right?  Well the reinforcements out of Calais changed that almost immediately and overwhelmed my puny 25th Pz and 78th Art rather quickly.

This game is such a blast.  I love the tension every turn, but wow, is it tough.  Seeing that Allied Operations box fill up with forces and then burst open with a &quot;Go!&quot; chit is brutal.  I honestly don&#039;t see even a hint of victory anywhere in sight, but that won&#039;t stop me from playing it.  It sets up quick and I can bang out a game (...er, defeat) in about an hour.  I can&#039;t wait to try it again.</body>

It&#039;s a game mat by Legion. They do a whole line of pretty cool ones. This one is called &quot;something wicked&quot;. Lots of retailers carry them.

Do you need all of those Half Dragon dice, given that it&#039;s ability is &quot;while active&quot;? And do you have any more Orc dice to utilise Swarm a bit more?

Great advice on the Half Dragon dice, I am just starting to play this game so I haven&#039;t really thought through my choices yet. That&#039;s all my orc dice, but there will be more boosters coming... :whistle:

Orc swarm is my favourite out of the cards that have it, because they have a big enough set of stats to keep them on the field to trigger the ability. Nothing like the feel of drawing and rolling a handful of Orcs. You are contractually obliged to scream &#039;WAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH&#039; when you roll them. Especially when playing solo.

Despite the fact that &quot;WAAAGGGHHH!&quot; is another universe I totally agree with you. I think 40K does Orks the right way (chaos, unpredictability, total disregard for self, and the more spectacular/violent the death the better) and tend to play orks in any game setting/universe like the 40K model.

	<body>My path takes me deep through the woodlands of Gorand&#039;s pass. There are plentiful goblins and  wolves in these parts and although I have some skill with an Iron Hatchet,  I have lost some of my resolve for the path of adventure. I am still hopeful.  A cold wind blows through the air and it chills me to the bones.

Soon into my path a wolf attacks. I make a reckless attack, but it succeeds in killing the wolf before it can attack back. I receive a fur tunic for my troubles. Then an orc soldier attacks further  down the road. I attack recklessly again and fell the cruel beast before it can attack.  I now claim an giant&#039;s tooth as my reward.

As I travel further, a storm blows in, threatening my resolve even more. I question why I make these travels. I am not sure of the gain. 

A swarm of goblins attack. I make a more cautious attack against both of them. I take a single wound for my troubles, but they are quickly dispatched. I then rest a bit, healing my wounds. Ironically, I find a priest down the road offering to heal my wounds.  I turn him down as I am healthy. He does tell me that the wolves have been behaving more aggressively as of late. There is likely a Black Fur that has moved in lately and established itself as alpha.  It looks as though I have purpose in this valley as of yet.  I continue my journey.

The storm blows harder. My resolve fades more. I doubt that my bones can take this horrible weather much longer. I feel tired.  I dispatch a wolf and a goblin with relative ease.  Another goblin is felled without any fuss. But the storm continues to blow harder and harder. I am exhausted. I cannot go on for much longer.

The vile Black Fur appears and I make a desperate attack against it. He is one vicious beast and tears into my thick leather armor leaving me in a state of hurt. But my desperate attack takes the beast down.  I am hurt. I am exhausted. But I am victorious.

I decide to make my way back to town. There are rumors of thieves about, but no matter. I must take a rest. I am ambushed by goblins in my journey back. I fight both cautious and defensively. I have nothing to prove, and these simple beasts are more or less, just in the way. Then another goblin falls.  I finally roll into a small village and rest at the inn. I regain some of my resolve, but I am still very tired.  The rest is healing and I am healthy again.

But the storm blows still and I feel exhausted again.  Still no sign of the thieves anywhere. I don&#039;t think I can manage much longer.  A begger appears. I give him something of value and he can feed himself for a month with the trading value.  My heart stirs with hope. Maybe this is not all for not.

An encounter with a Dire Wolf leaves me wounded. Time feels like it is against me.  But there is hope. The storm finally blows  over, and heavy rain falls. Hard fighting conditions, but I can manage. The rain then stops, but dark skies remain.  Stopping to rest, the skies clear up for what seems like the first time in weeks. 

I am in a cheery though exhausted disposition when I encounter my first thief.  He falls without much effort. I hope to find one more soon.  I do not succeed and retire unfulfilled in my adventures for I am too exhausted to continue.

	<body>Finally I managed to complete the first mission and it was a piece of cake!

My squad encountered just a sniper on a palm tree, some abandoned huts and a trap... that&#039;s it. And as you guess I lost the mission with 2 VP versus the needed 8.

I&#039;ll try it again today taking a different path towards north.

	<body>New entry since I&#039;m finally playing this correctly! 

If it weren&#039;t for my Canadian 1 Player guild friends I&#039;d be lost. 
[user=reverendunclebastard][/user]
set me straight on this one

and [user=Moe45673][/user] set me straight on Loyang!

You guys are the best. Perhaps I should move to Canada to gain a better understanding of gaming?

Anyhow, this game, set in Canada really, is very fun and challenging. I have set myself a solo &quot;win&quot; condition. You have to get all 5 discovery tokens (1 of each) to have a &quot;win&quot;. As well as be positive in your score. Most likely if you&#039;re able to do the one the other will follow because of the little bonus you get. It&#039;s tough though!  I think the tiles do need to come out in a favorable way in order to be able to mostly use the special solo game tile drawing rule. 

I especially enjoy that this game sets up and re-sets up quickly thanks to my little Plano organizer.

Game 1 saw me get to the Passage relatively late. I had a big island in the way (which never got completed unfortunately). I saw I had a chance to get 2 sets of the discovery tokens and went for it. Apparently that particular expedition was never heard from again. All hands lost. -33. :shake:

Game 2 was a quick re-set (yay!), and I was at it again, this time vowing to be a little more conservative. I made it to the Passage in time to get the 10 points again. I worked my way back, but it was a trade off between losing the ship and all hands again or picking up some Franklin wreckage. Needless to say I made a bee-line for Groenland. I had 4/5 tokens and a final score of 0 thanks to lots of islands discovered. I benefited a lot from islands that bordered the edge of the map. That was about half of them!

:thumbsup:&#039;s and :thumbsdown:&#039;s: I&#039;m really enjoying the exploration mechanism in this game, and find the discovery tokens very thematic, except for one: the straits. Why don&#039;t I score them just for sailing through them? That seems to be how they would be &quot;discovered!&quot;  Still, quite a fun thematic package here. 


Update 9/9/15:
I got in 2 games last night. I love that about this game. Quick set up and play yet plenty of brain burn with tile selection, placement and timing. Actually 2.5 games because I had to abort one due to having placed a tile illegally and it was too late to fix.

Anyhow. Game 1 I accomplished all my goals! Except one. I got to the Passage and scored 10 pts. I got a full set of Discovery tokens and found some islands! The one thing I missed? I didn&#039;t make it back to Groenland. All hands lost. I would think that the Groenlanders would have been able to see their ship founder it was that close. Final score was -1. I think I got too greedy.

Game 2 went better. It almost went exceptionally well. I was one crew member short of getting 2 sets of Discovery tokens! I was more efficient and I didn&#039;t let my sled wander off as far as I have in the past, and was able to scoop them up and head for Groenland. I finished with a final score of 8!

	<body>Played yet another game of this! This time I decided to go with 1 hero just to see if it worked as well as the marketing says it does.

Want to find out? Read on!

Just kidding, I hate when people do that. It totally worked! I played with the optional solitaire rules regarding equipment, reinforcements, and starting cash.

Wave 1:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yf4rN06.jpg[/IMG]

Sorry for the bad pic quality. Done with my phone and it took me awhile to actually properly figure out how to get good pics. Anyhow, I used Ember the archer and hired a foot soldier with the starting cash. S&#039;long, baddies!

Wave 2:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/NZHZuuK.jpg[/IMG]

Ah yes. Notice the slight improvement in sharp edges and color. Almost like, dare I say it, I knew what I was doing. Regarding gameplay, Quinten was a beast. Using him to tank remote baddies almost made me feel bad for them. Wow, Psionics are pretty kickass! This mental clickage unlocked a whole new set of strategies for me, a way where I can finally see something approaching a session that doesn&#039;t involve me being swamped in the final wave.

Wave 3:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nB7hLj2.jpg[/IMG]

Now is that a picture or what? 

&quot;Yeah, Moe, congratulations. You&#039;ve made it to the 20th century with your photography skills&quot;.

Boy, that Daniel. Jumps right into the thick of things, not noticing how low his health gets. Wait, don&#039;t say it. Don&#039;t say it!

[IMG]http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/If+_aa9c817f242953f328bb7e7c48024574.jpg[/IMG]

Bastards.

Wave 4:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/sEBmxrX.jpg[/IMG]

I have taken my picture skills to &quot;Common Instagram User&quot;. I am awarded 3 XP and a crushing inferiority complex.

So I had to get Nancy (level 2 cleric). Thanks a lot, Daniel, way to make me throw money to keep your dumb ass alive. 

Wave 5:

[IMG]*placeholder*[/IMG]

Yeah, I forgot to take a pic of the start of the wave. 

&quot;We&#039;re already aware of your mental deficiencies regarding the visual arts. No need to say anything!&quot;

Shut up, Internet! I did take some more pics. Here&#039;s one of me throwing a rain of arrows on some tough baddies!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FHmflNX.jpg[/IMG]

And, haha, here&#039;s one of my crushing defeat!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MphKd4D.jpg[/IMG]

Wait......

So yeah, the game plays exceptionally well with 1 hero. In future, I am going to try..... four. I predict quite a bit of table space but less money going towards hireables and more towards equipment, as well as saving up for the armory card. 

Love that Quinten. What a beast. </body>

My one negative about the game. It takes about 3 hours...... but part of that is rule referencing and stuff (what actually takes a long time is, not necessarily finding the rule, but rather interpreting rules and wondering if you even need to do a rule lookup at times). I&#039;ve also tended to stack the &quot;1&quot; hitpoints under characters and the time doing that adds up. I think using the &quot;5&quot; and &quot;10&quot; hitpoint tokens, while less visually cool, should speed that up.  I&#039;m guessing it takes the designer 135 minutes to play a 5 Wave campaign. 

Part of me thinks &quot;I could be playing Mage Knight during this time&quot; but the other part of me is happy to play a game with lots of hacking and slashing and minimal brainburn. I can leave the game and come back to it later and not be all &quot;ok, what the heck was my plan again???&quot;. 

The good news is, more people shouldn&#039;t lengthen the time it takes to play. When the fiddlier bits can be divvied up amongst multiple people, that should speed things up!

I do think this would be a lot of fun co-op. I love games where you can support your teammates well (one reason I really enjoy XCOM).

I&#039;ve probably missed an explanation somewhere, but I just noticed all the little numbers on the tokens. Seems like that&#039;d take some getting used to.

You&#039;d think so........ But they&#039;re really straightforward. They mean (top to bottom, left to right)

	<body>Puh, just finished my first game.

It has lain for two weeks on my table, the pure playing time was something over 5 hours.

The Resultat was -9 points, what is a draw. :what:

But it was much fun and I got help at some rule questions from:

[user=Ibbo][/user]

I will get this game out soon again.

A few of us have been playing out the campaign of this for the 75th Anniversary. I try to play the actual day on the correct date so it is a pseudo live game using the weather as per 1940. My attempt started on 11th August and ran through to the 31st August when I was finally defeated. It was a brutal game with my end of day score on that day reaching -48 points horrendous!

I am currently playing the Thin Blue Line Scenario which starts on the 27th August. Same process as above. I have only just managed to get back in line with the date so I have just finished 9th September 1940. I am currently on -16 Vps but have a fairly strong RAF so hopefully will do ok. The historic weather for 1940 will give me a little respite in a couple of days.

Anyone who is interested in our progress can check out this link:

Anyone who wants to dive in and record their efforts then do feel free!

I like it.  The game is basically [thing=99698][/thing] with a LOT more cards for added variability.  The game has multi-player rules, but it&#039;s basically multi-player solitaire.

However, a couple of days ago, I was hanging out with the designer, who showed me a 2-4 player variant that he and a buddy was making.  It turned this game from a Euro solitaire to a multi-player 4X wargame, and let me tell you...THAT was awesome.  Stay tuned for his release of the rules.

Keep in mind I&#039;m a wargamer through and through, so anything that lets me bash my opponents and conquer his systems is always going to score a lot of points with me.

I&#039;ve had good results battling musty/smokey smells in old games by following this recipe:

- Get a wide, shallow plastic bin with a lid.
- Line the bottom with charcoal briquettes.
- Spread a few layers of newspaper on top. 
- Spread the game components out on top of the newspaper and sprinkle liberally with baking soda. 
- Snap on the lid and let sit 2-3 days. 
- Brush off the components and then air them out in the open on top of some fresh newspaper for a couple more days. 
- Add salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy. (oh, wrong recipe...)

	<body>After a false start, starting the game with the mid-day deck (oops), I reset and managed a Marginal Defeat (-15).

The &quot;second&quot; game became tough rather quickly, the 5th card I drew had me shuffle in the mid-day cards and after only getting 11 turns into the game I had to shuffle in the dusk cards.  I did manage to win a lot of the off-map battles, a coup (all of which came out before the Intelligence was established) and all but one of the Kaiser battles but in the end - and for the first time for me - the Arab front descended upon Constantinople to end the game.

Now that my appetite was whet I decided to try the combined game for the first time.  I&#039;ll post that later.  I set it up last evening but didn&#039;t get a chance to get started.  Hopefully, I&#039;ll be able to play that tonight.</body>

	<body>I played a quick game of this, still takes up a ridiculous table space for it&#039;s weight and player count, still incredibly relaxing game. Still far too easy (Played at 6 vitality cards desolute side up to start this time). Going to try mixing in an expansion next time I play, see if that helps the difficulty problem. I won with 8 excess vitality in the form of trees that I didn&#039;t need.

:thumbsup: Increadably relaxing game experience while playing it
:thumbsdown: Takes up a whole chunk of table considering how light the gameplay is
:thumbsdown: Far too easy at it&#039;s base difficulty, and ridiculously easy even using one of the difficulty adjustments offered by the game.</body>

They&#039;re similarly light, at least before you pull in any of the expansion modules (Of which Onirim has significantly more), though mechanically very different.

Mechanically I think I&#039;d probably compare Sylvion to the video game Plants vs Zombies - This is a lane based tower defense game. A weirdly surreal one, where you&#039;re fighting fire elementals with fountains, growing trees to replenish your base at the end of the game, and moving the fire elementals into different lanes by having whales carry them in their mouths, but a lane based tower defense game at it&#039;s core.

For me, at least, the theme comes across a lot stronger in Sylvion than Onirim, incidentally, though I haven&#039;t started mixing expansions in to either yet.

I&#039;ve not mixed in the expansions yet either, but the exact word I&#039;ve used to describe Onirim is relaxing - which is what caught my eye. I&#039;m just a sucker for the style, artwork and theme etc. of these Oniverse games. I&#039;ve picked up so many very light, &#039;unchallenging&#039;games recently that I&#039;m looking for something with a little more meat on the bones at the minute. Definitely going to keep an eye out for a cheap copy of this one though.

...If by unchallenging you mean difficulty of winning rather than difficulty to play, this one&#039;s definitely not what you&#039;re after right now. (Granted it&#039;s a breeze to play as well as a breeze to win, but...)

	<body>Played Tunnel Fever as the Soldier and lost.  The viruses just had too many high numbers and I couldn&#039;t control the population losses.

I liked the soldier&#039;s ability to stack attack powers of weapons - that made defeating the monsters easier than with other characters, but hiring mercenaries quickly became difficult - I just didn&#039;t have the resources I have had with other characters.  It was a neat balance.

It does play well solo.  I really enjoy this as a solo game.  I like that the characters can be either male or female.  I like the story aspect of it.  I like the artwork.  I like that I only need to manage a single character.  I think it is a fun game. 

The game rules include three ways to play the game, and two of them are playable solo (the arena scenario is strictly PvP).

	<body>Some of you may remember on last month’s list I linked to an Amazon listing for both Shadows of Brimstone games, together for about $96. I hemmed and hawed about it, and at last my wife was the one to pull the trigger on it.

After I had made the purchase, I found this thread ([url]https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1417597/alive-amazon-shadows-brimstone-both-city-ancients/page/1[/url]), showing the experiences others had had with this listing. Apparently there was a trend of people getting only one of the games (always Swamps of Death it appears), and upon contacting the seller were issued a full refund and told to keep the product.

So I hoped for the best as I [b]waited[/b] for my games to arrive from the UK, and at last a giant box arrived! My wife sent me a message at work that said “Swamps of Death?”

Me: “Just one game?”

Wife: “Yes. Man, this is nerdy looking.”

Disappointing, but their customer service was very quick to respond. I’ll be getting a full refund, and keeping Swamps of Death. I do feel bad for this company in a way; the amazon listing clearly is aware of two different games existing. The box it arrived in was even large enough that it could have fit both games :/ So I don’t know where the disconnect is, but several people have had this same experience, and it has to be costing them a good deal of money.

Financial concerns aside, I am now the proud owner of this giant box and all of its contents. I spent the long weekend gluing and punching, leaving me with two sliced fingers and some reasonably well-assembled minis. This was my first experience with assembling miniatures for a game, and I think it went well.

I’m about halfway through the rulebook, I’ve chosen my characters, and I have printed the Hexcrawl stuff in preparation for some sweet monster killing. I’ll hopefully play my first game sometime this week.

Enjoy! The game is a great RPG experience. I would highly recommend printing out one of the RPG-style character sheets from the file section. You will quickly end up changing your stats and accumulating gear and mutations, so having a reasonably small footprint way to track it is key!

	<body>After I couldn&#039;t take getting beaten by Gears of war any more I turned to this lighter game.

Turned out to be only marginally friendlier.

Managed 3 games before I had to pick up the girls from school.

Started with a win against the Omniblend AI on easy. 21-15.

Then took it on at standard difficulty and lost 17-22.

Finally I tried the Sacchar AI on easy and lost 19-22.

I love this as a quick dice game with an opponent. The 2 AI&#039;s work pretty well, are different from each other and put you under pressure from the get go. You are constantly forced to choose between blending, research and sticking with your blend or abandoning it.

I wanted to get in another couple of games, including one against both AI&#039;s at the same time but ran out of time.

:thumbsup: The AI opponents work well to make this &#039;filler&#039; game a decent solo experience.

:thumbsdown: It&#039;s a dice game so if they don&#039;t work for you then this probably won&#039;t do anything to change that.

:thumbsdown: Some of the components (e.g research abilities) aren&#039;t used in the solo game.</body>

Not yet. Maybe I should.  I think they are in the loft - when I put the game in a large plastic organiser box with 6 or 7 other games I only put in the solo specific stuff.

	<body>Well, hopefully, the third time&#039;s the charm.

I played Snowdonia on TTS and reported on it for the August SGOYT.  I have since determined that I was playing incorrectly.  I saw no need/benefit from buying the engine so I never did.  I later came to find out that one of the major benefits of having the engine was to employ that third laborer (at the cost of one coal) - something I had been doing the whole game anyway.  So that basically invalidated my two solo plays thus far.

I liked the game so much that I bought a copy of it, and set it up last night for my first solo using the physical game.  I was nearly done when I drew a contract card that lets me take the &quot;First Player Marker&quot;. Of course, I don&#039;t care about this for a solo game, but it got me thinking - once you get this card in a multi-player game, how would anyone else ever get to go first?  So I went through the rules and BGG trying to answer this question, and discovered that you only get to use the special effects of the contract cards ONCE!  I had been using those abilities repeatedly in all my plays!  So I immediately tore down that game and set it up for another play, hopefully tonight.

One thing I noticed in this game was that if you use less than 6 resources each turn, as I often did, the bag will empty out quickly, leaving only event cubes which get played over and over, hastening the end of the game.  So that is something that I really need to manage in future games.

I did have one question - suppose there are 3 cubes left in the bag when it is time to stock the yard.  I pull an iron ore, a coal, and an event cube.  I place the event cube and resolve the event, which causes 3 more white cubes to go back into the bag.  Am I done with this phase, or do I need to draw those other 3 white cubes out to make 6 cubes total?  (I don&#039;t think you do because the book talks about if the bag doesn&#039;t have enough cubes, you just draw what you can.)

--Edit--
Third time WAS the charm.  What a challenging game when you actually play it by the rules.  I think I did pretty well, and now I&#039;m wondering how the heck I&#039;m going to beat this score 6 more times.  During this game, I didn&#039;t really keep a running score.  In future games, I will probably need to do that so I can keep an eye my target.  Maybe I should have sandbagged this one?

Full Game, Engine #1:
Completed sites: 3+7+7+9+9+14=49
Completed track: 2+2+2+5+3+3+4=21
Contract cards: 31+16+17+11=75
Surveyor: 11
Total: 49+21+75+11=156

Thanks for the confirmation.  That&#039;s the way I was playing it, and it&#039;s much more forgiving that way.

BTW, Tony - as a game designer you may be uneasy about your game being available for free on the likes of TTS, but in my case, 2 or 3 plays was all it took for me to order my own copy, so I find it to be a great demo platform.  I&#039;ll likely eventually buy the expansions over time as well.  Great game!

I like it when I can get the phantom company to do the work I want them to do, when I want them to. Sometimes it means being patient, other times it&#039;s a scramble!

[b]Tow Handed[/b]
This is my first game playing this movie but it might be my favorite.  I really like the character deck and the end challenge of having two tough final enemies.  The Monster&#039;s Mother card is pretty awesome too.  Very very powerful if you get it early like I did.  This card allows you to gain a dead alien.  you get the benefit of the aliens attack value which even the weakest aliens are generally more powerful then your best character card.  Example of how powerful this card can be below.  I used this card when killing the newborn.  The Newborn is dead and now I use the Monster&#039;s Mother ability and gain the 13 attack newborn to my deck :)
[ImageID=2659924 large]
While I had the Newborn in my deck I never got a change to draw it.  Really, I didn&#039;t even need it.  With the help of two other aliens I killed the Queen.
[ImageID=2659929 large]

[b]Game:[/b] 2/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b]0 Drones, 1 hive in complex
[b]Tow Handed[/b]
Well, I got a little too brave with ramping up the difficulty.  The first hive card reveled in the complex was a Xenomorph Runner.  It made it&#039;s way to the combat zone quickly and it stayed there for a long time.  By the time I could generate a measly 4 attack, I had to use it on the facehugger drawn from the stike deck.  When I finally was able to kill the Xenomorph, two more were in the combat zone.  I never stood a chance this game.  In my final turn I drew 4 strike cards with only 4 health to spare.  First character died early in the 2nd objective.  When that happens I just call it game over.  No point trudging through the rest of the game with the other hand.

[b]Game:[/b] 3/3
[b]Difficulty: [/b]0 Drones
[b]Tow Handed[/b]
Crushed again... The first hazard card came out early and I could not get rid of it.  Another Xenomorph Runner made it into the combat zone early again and was causing the normal amount of trouble for me.  The killer was the 2nd objective event cards with 3 clones on the table.  I&#039;m not done with this movie yet...</body>

	<body>Reported this session on the Undercity game page, but I&#039;ll add it here to the SGOYT.

After watching the videos and reading the rules, I finally found the time to set this up in my home office and started playing it.

I really like this game, even though I&#039;ve played the first scenario a few times due to mistakes that I made.  I still have some questions about ranged characters activating and I keep forgetting to use both of a character&#039;s weapons (looking at you Milo with your throwing dagger and your explosions!), but I really hope that they make more scenarios, campaigns and characters for this.  If this was a FFG game, I wouldn&#039;t be worried (except for worrying about too *many* expansions), but I hope Privateer Press can keep the momentum on this.  I actually feel that they need to make expansions to bring more people on board.

Thoughts on the game itself: The &quot;drab&quot; board isn&#039;t as bad as people are making it out to be. I do wish that the tiles clicked together like Descent&#039;s tiles as I kept knocking them, but that was a small thing. The Villain activation was easy to figure out and worked quite well. The Crossbow thugs stayed at range and fired away while the Sword thugs swarmed their target. 

My scenario ended with Canice having sprinted to get the loot, each character got 5XP, and a few wounds on some of the characters.  I&#039;ll probably play this scenario one more time and hope to get every rule right before moving on to the next scenario.</body>

	<body>Time to play Death Angel again.

This game was my re-entry into board gaming after a very long hiatus. Saw this when it came out and it&#039;s solitaire playability got me going again. Just looking at the date for this when posting this entry - it&#039;s been over five years now!

Anyway, for about the second time, I actually managed to win! I had a few good rolls at the start and managed to keep control of the board for most of the game. It got a little ropey towards the end whilst playing the &#039;Toxin Pumping Station&#039;, which required me to clear out the Genestealers; two draws of &#039;The Swarm&#039; event which added two &#039;Stealers to each blip pile.

Hero of the piece was Sergeant Lorenzo from the sword team. His valiant defence kept the squads together.

Lost a couple of marines in the last stage, but won out with four marines.

	<body>I finally finished my first play through of the Into the Wilds Scenario.  Then I reset and played again.

Characters:
Venda
Ardenai

[b]Game 1:[/b] I didn&#039;t complete a single encounter. That was partly though bad luck and partly through figuring out the depths of the game.
[b]Game 2:[/b] I made it through 2 encounters, but enemies did not disperse, so I could not heal, and that took too much time. I initiated battle against the boss, but had no time to defeat him.

:thumbsup: Depth of characters, cards, and strategy.
:thumbsup: Lots of characters and scenarios to play through straight out of the box.
:thumbsdown: Brutally tough. You have to know each characters to create combos that work for the scenario. This was much more of a brainburner than I expected.
:thumbsdown: Not a game I would ever play or teach to others. It&#039;s that complicated. But as this is the Solo Games played list, this isn&#039;t really a problem!</body>

I think the key to success (in my limited experience at least) is trying to resolve encounters as quickly as possible, ideally in one turn - even if it means driving your focus way up. That way you don&#039;t have to deal with reinforcements (so high focus doesn&#039;t matter) and, as long as you&#039;ve also prioritized taking out Relentless enemies, you can rest for free. It&#039;s easier said than done but in my successful play-throughs I&#039;d say I&#039;ve finished 80% of my encounters in one turn. Sometimes by killing all the enemies, but just as many times by fulfilling whatever the other end condition is on the encounter card - don&#039;t overlook those!

In any case, this makes fast and reflex actions that deal damage a real priority to get and use.

I&#039;m still trying to figure out optimal strategies but this has been what&#039;s worked for me so far...

I definitely realized my error with the relentless enemies. After two plays, I have a decent understanding how it all works. The resting after finishing an encounter is critical.

	<body>So... this post isn&#039;t about playing Space Hulk.  In fact it&#039;s not about Space Hulk.  It&#039;s not even about playing a game. :ninja:

I went into my local game store to buy a copy of Space Hulk: Death Angel because I&#039;d seen a copy there before.  They didn&#039;t have it.  They NEVER have what I&#039;m looking for. I usually go to another game store about 45 minutes away as a result, but I stopped in today.

Then I thought I might pick up the latest Eldritch Horror expansion... they didn&#039;t have that either.:shake:

Oh well, I&#039;ve come to expect that at this store. I took a stroll through the rest of the store anyway and to my surprise, I found this!

[imageid=2660336medium]

So it came home with me.  I wasn&#039;t even looking to pick up a copy, but you guys all seem to love it and it&#039;s going out of print. How could I pass it up?

Now for my apologies.
1) I apologize to my local game store for being so down on your selection.  Thank you for hiding this gem away for me to discover.

2) I apologize to you guys for this post on SGOYT that isn&#039;t about playing a game, but I had to share my excitement with someone and my wife was not impressed.  Besides, you guys largely influenced this impulse buy &amp; I figured you might like to see the fruits of your labors here in the 1 player guild.

I&#039;ll play a game of it this month and post about it.  Hopefully that&#039;ll make up for #2 above.:D

As an aside, how do you change the size of photos in posts like this? I see lots of larger photos in posts, but I can only get the smaller default size.

+Edit+
Increased photo size. Thanks Suzy!!</body>

I had to pick it up used at the last BGG Con. But it was in great shape and had the expansion included as well.

The game and expansion is for sale at a norwegian online store, but converted to American dollars and included shipping across the ocean it would cost both of your legs and arms, and even a neighbours arm, I guess.

Pre-edit so no one gets too excited: I meant the title of the item on the geeklist.  I think Gears of War is really gone for good :(

I am pretty sure it is being reprinted.  Do a search and if so - just be a little patient!  I&#039;m sure your other games can keep you occupied :)

Where did you hear that? The official news was that FFG let the license lapse, which seems right as they then sold off all their stock dirt cheap and removed the game from their home page. 

That being said, they may eventually reskin the mechanics, but I suspect that will take at least a year or two.

Those sound good. I could also see an easy X-Com themed version, though that&#039;d be pretty similar to what it is already.

Actually, I suddenly imagined a cheesy spy shooter retheme modeled after an on-rails shooter like Time Crisis. That would be cool.

I think I&#039;d rather some other theme, actually.  I never played Gears of War - I got it in spite of the title, not because of it.  I took convincing to buy it :)

I think most would argue that the game quality surpasses any misgivings about the theme. It does feel a lot like the video game, though. I only played the first and a half games. It got pretty repetitive for me as the second game didn&#039;t seem to introduce much new to the formula.

	<body>Lately, I’ve been playtesting “A Glorious Chance”, a solitaire wargame that simulates the struggle for Lake Ontario between the American and British navies in the War of 1812. 

[ImageID=2659052 large]

The player commands the American forces seeking to wrest control of the Lake – dominated by the British at the beginning of the game – from the AI. The player sends his fleet on different types of missions in order to score VP’s by controlling Lake areas, invading/raiding enemy strongholds, and sinking major enemy ships. The AI (inspired by John Butterfield’s [thing=3202]RAF[/thing]) will respond to American incursions to varying degrees depending on its current strategic priorities – or it may seek to exploit holes in the player’s strategy to score extra VP’s.  

The scale is operational, with each turn representing two weeks. Counters representing individual ships (two types of schooners, brigs, and corvettes). The situation is asymmetrical: the player has far more ships -- but, in the main, they are also far less capable then those of their adversary; the British start with a small but powerful fleet hampered by a lack of long guns…initially, at least. Other features include random events, tactics chits, leadership effects, weapon differences, ship repair and construction, and more – leading to surprising granularity in a semi-abstract game in addition to a rich narrative.  

This is an impressive effort from first-time designer, 

[user=broadsword56][/user]

She plans to merge this operational–level game with a “Maneuver Level” system featuring tactical combat; alternately she also has designed the game to be compatible with other Age of Sail tactical systems such as [thing=8730]Flying Colors[/thing]. 

“A Glorious Chance” is in active playtesting. I encourage you to try it out and lend a hand by geekmailing the designer.  

For a taste of how the game plays (but NOT how to play it well!), here’s [thread=1432071]an AAR of a recent game.[/thread]

Very cool Chris. I&#039;m an Age of Sail fan, and I&#039;ve eyed this one from a distance as I&#039;m no great wargamer. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d get in to playtesting (I barely have the energy to play what I have), but I will be eagerly awaiting your updates!

	<body>This is a kind of [i]personal [/i]post to our host [b]Lorenzo[/b], who wrote a comment on the precedent post about [gameid=71721] :

[q=&quot;lukather&quot;]There&#039;s a Sergeant Lorenzo in the game? I&#039;ve to buy it! :-P[/q]
Last weekend, I was in [b]your wonderful country[/b] :).

I was in a space-adventure’s mood, after playing [gameid=146652] several time in a row. I didn’t expect to have enough time to play a game and took [gameid=71721] instead (it’s smaller in the bag).

On Sunday morning, everybody being asleep, I could enjoy playing an outdoor-sun-rising-game (love that :D!)

[imageid=2660662medium]

At first, I couldn’t understand why [b]ALL [/b]of you criticize the red die …. 
Never saw the 0 but so many skulls that I killed easily many Genestealers (Brother Claudius helped a lot) : it was a piece of cake to travel to the second location. 
I was almost disappointed ….

Then I understood the pressure, the claustrophobic feeling, the red die annoyance (Brother Claudius was blown away by the die malfunction, all the remaining marines were shooting nowhere near an enemy…). I finally lost the game before reaching the last location… 

Sorry Lorenzo: the Sergeant was killed. He fought bravely, though ;)

I saw the light : this red die is evil! (and the game is fun!)

We love it there and go whenever it’s possible: the coast is well protected from modern buildings (the French side is “over-built”) and there is a cycling path along the sea (close to the French border) which is [b]absolutely fantastic[/b] :D

	<body>It&#039;s been a while since a solo game has bit my table but I managed to get Race for the Galaxy to the table last night and suffered another loss at the hands of the robot.  The Robot beat me with a score of 43 - 30 which isn&#039;t as humiliating a loss as I have experienced.  I usually focus on a military strategy but today I went for a Produce and Trade/Consume strategy with a few 6 cost development cards to up my point values.  Ihad a big play planned for my next turn but the Robot took the last VP just before.

Better luck next time I suppose.</body>

Played with the new ship that Tony put up in the thread. Made a nice change, though it felt much harder - I lost after only getting through about 1/3 of the threat deck!  Yikes!

	<body>[COLOR=#747474][i]Previous note: this post was to be made last week, since I played it on thursday. But then...my laziness took over me until today.[/i][/COLOR]

[user=wolffe][/user] made last year a series of [geekurl=/filepage/98827/high-ink-weekly-challenges-updated-regularly-subsc]20 weekly challenge[/geekurl] which I came across when I exploring the forum a couple of weeks ago. Last thursday, I decided to star working on beaten them starting, of course, by the 1st one.

Solo mode.
Setup:
- Heroes: Captain America, Deadpool, Punisher, Daredevil, Hulk and Wolwerine (X-men);
- Mastermind: Mr. Sinister;
- Villains: Skrulls and Savage Land Mutates.
- Scheme: Secret Invasion of the Skrull Shapeshifters.

Well, at the beginning I was a little scared about this one. I&#039;ve never played this scheme so I wasn&#039;t sure if the heroes on the villain deck would start to kick me pretty bad. It turns out a very smooth game.
Probably I was lucky with the villain deck (almost all the heroes from there were 2/3 cost, a few with 5 and only 3 ST came out of it) but I was able to built a strong deck, with a lot of combos that kept giving me enough strength to beat the bad guys (the captain&#039;s rare card is just from another world).

At the end:
Good won. Final score: 42</body>

	<body>A 4-day weekend almost came and went without a single game played... until Sunday night when I managed to get in a quick solo run with the Knight.   ([i]That&#039;s a [b]true solo[/b] too, not multiplayer solo.[/i])

This time I used a stronger version of the ambushes to push the challenge up, and it worked out pretty well. I also kept in as many of the other cards as possible, which thanks to recent revisions is now possible for almost all of them - only three have to get pulled, instead of half a dozen previously.

I managed to win this one with a little bit of cushion, and had three tiles left in the draw pile when I began my final turn.   Those all would have gone down at the end of the turn, and then the collapse would have begun on the following turn.  The way the tiles were set up the whole thing would have come down within (at most) 2 turns.

When it ended my final health was at 2, mostly from ambush damage.   Some events hurt too, although a helpful beam of light kept me going when I needed it.   The Potion Kit was never found.

A little more testing is still needed too see if anything else needs to be adjusted yet, but balance-wise this feels really close to right.</body>

	<body>I gave the combined game a go for the first time. Unfortunately the Aus/Hungarian side fell rather quickly, so quickly I didn&#039;t really get to take advantage of the railroad and sharing resources.  I also forgot to activate the railroad now that I think about it, perhaps I could have taken advantage!

Above is the picture of the endgame.  I found it easier to use the paper maps and my acrylic than to use the puzzle maps for this. (I pushed the Hapsburg deck off to the side since they were out first.)

I know I did not play optimally so I&#039;ll reserve judgement, however, I do enjoy both games of course.  The Hapsburg board turned on me fast and I just couldn&#039;t get a handle on the Carpathian front which is what entered Vienna to end that part of the game. I was doing fairly well on the Ottoman side until I lost control of the Meso front which is how that side ended.

Both sides finished with a Marginal Defeat, Hapsburg with a -25 and Ottoman with a -15. I may have to run a few rounds of Hapsburg alone again, just to refresh myself and improve my strategy there.  While I have enjoyed one Operational Victory in Ottoman my best Hapsburg game so far has been a strategic stalemate so I&#039;m sure I can improve that.

I&#039;ve left this out on the table for a reset, I&#039;ll see if I can dig into it again this week. </body>

	<body>Well it took me forever, but I finished my second play through of Fire in the Lake.  

Oh the AI...I&#039;m actually feeling pretty comfortable that I am doing things correctly, but it is taking me F-O-R-E-V-E-R to do every card (there is a lot of thinking, then checking, and then rechecking going on).  I cringe every time I work down the flow charts and end up at Sweep (with Air Lift), Assault (with Air Lift) or, God forbid, a free March.  Yes, I love that there IS an answer.  And I love that you can credibly play such a deep game solitaire.  And I really, really appreciate that skill in which the AI was designed (brilliant how every scenario I&#039;ve come across has been contemplated...well actually I did run into the &quot;I&#039;ve already executed a Raid so I need to pay for a ARVN Patrol without moving any pieces&quot; in the errata, but still)...but I&#039;m not sure I have it in me to keep learning it so that I can complete a single card in less than 45 minutes!  The last card before the final Coup, the last Coup round, and final scoring took me just shy of two hours last night!  YIKES!

As for my actual game play, I set up Westy&#039;s War (1965-1967, the short scenario) with Period Events.  I played as the VC against the 3 non-player bots.  I started out slow, but was able to do some real damage to ARVN patronage through events.  I was slowly losing bases via US Sweep and Air Strikes, but then the NVA ended up in a relatively tight time frame with two events that gave them free Marches (the Trail was stuck at 0-1 the whole game, so that was huge for them).  They quickly drew the attention of the US, who had lost two bases, and gave me some more room to operate.  The first coup card had come out right in the middle of the first set, but the second came out on the first card possible, which gave me comfort that I would have time to see my plans develop.  A series of AI instructions had left Saigon lightly defended, so I was able to March a bunch of my gathered guerrillas into Saigon.  This was a risky move, as they had all been activated, but they never ended up being targeted as there was always some NVA-controlled population that was a higher priority.  An event had knocked down Saigon support to Passive, and without COIN control, the end of game Support Phase was key for me as I was able to get Saigon to Passive Opposition through Agitation for end of game scoring.  Final score: VC: 0, NVA: -11, ARVN: -9, US: -25.  National Liberation!

Here was my board at the end of the game:

Hey Hough, congrats on National Liberation!

The short scenario is in my view a really nice way of experiencing the game. It&#039;s really tight. I prefer to play the most central faction of the game myself, namely the US. You&#039;re fighting so many different kinds of fights all at the same time (military, the hearts and minds, as well as your mostly useless ally ARVN) but there&#039;s so little time and ARVN resources to do it.

Next I want to play the Med scenario with 10 card decks. That way the Pivotals are in play but the game won&#039;t take forever.

PS. I know there are ways for the Trail to sink that low but did you remember the AAA capability with which NVA starts the scenario?

Hey thanks masil!  You gave me some inspiration to keep trying this.  I stuck to the VC again to make implementing the bots easier since I had already worked through some of it the first time around.  Whenever I pull it out again, I was thinking about a US/ARVN combo play.

[q=&quot;masil&quot;]PS. I know there are ways for the Trail to sink that low but did you remember the AAA capability with which NVA starts the scenario?
[/q]

Yes I actually did!  No air strikes knocking this one down!  Every time the NVA rallied they didn&#039;t have enough resources left over to improve the Trail either.

You know, your post has just inspired me to get FitL back on the table! I&#039;ve had the Med Scenario with 10 card rounds set up for a while and now you&#039;ve nudged me to get to it now. Thanks!

As good of a job as they did with the bots in these games, I don&#039;t use them.

I just play all sides equally.

For FitL, I play it as a two player game to keep me honest.  Because each side&#039;s &quot;score&quot; is the lowest of the two factions they (me) control, I can&#039;t let one run away with the game from the others.  I think it works really well this way.

I wish I could get there.  Other than on a first play through to learn the rules, I just can&#039;t play multi-handed.  I don&#039;t enjoy trying to segment my brain to &quot;forget&quot; what strategy my other hand is plotting, particularly in a game like this where you need to think strategically ahead, not just react tactically.  I see people here do it all the time-I envy them!  :D

	<body>Played the third campaign - 1800 (second Italian campaign)

This is a really short campaign. Win it in 3 turns to match Napoleon.

Realising time was of the essence I attacked Milan straight away with all of Napoleon&#039;s forces that had started in Lonato.

A well fought battle there led to a rout of the enemy forces and the city was captured.  The sweep and engineer insights working well again.

I had 2 resupply points so I had the choice. Sit and regroup or force march a couple of my forces and attack the weak forces in Marengo.  I attacked.

A good fog of war roll allowed me to bring an extra mobile force in to the battle.  This would prove decisive as it allowed me to win the envelope check, totally destroying the forces there.

At the end of my first turn I had 4 of the 5 objectives needed to win.  I bought 2 cannons (the one thing I lacked) and some more cavalry.

The enemy&#039;s first turn also went in my favour.  1 force attacked my forces in Marengo and lost an envelope check again, another attacked my forces in Genoa.

The battle in Genoa was aided when my fog of war roll allowed Napoleon to move to the battle.  My cannons won this battle.

Then it was my next turn.  The forces in Savona were vast.  Total strength was 29.  I would be able to muster forces of strength 30.  Waiting another turn wasn&#039;t going to help much (and would probably spread my forces too much) so I attacked.

Another good fog of war roll allowed me to bring another infantry unit to the battle boosting my strength to 36.  I then successfully activated my sweep and engineer insights which reduced the enemy&#039;s strength to 19 and removed a couple of their units.

After that though I wasn&#039;t able to put enough hits on the enemy as my cannon missed a couple of times and their strongest units kept getting battle plans that kept them out of range of my infantry.  Time was running out.

On the final turn I lost a unit (poor Suchet) but had them down to a garrison unit and a strong cavalry unit.  Total strength 10.  My strength was 24.  If I could hit the garrison with my cannon then they would only be at 7 and I would win a rout check.

I need a 6 or less as I was using the Grapeshot battle plan.  I rolled a 7.

This meant the battle ended and I had to roll for withdrawal. There&#039;s always a 30% chance of a French Retreat at this point which would have been meant another turn would be needed.

I looked at the die.  Don&#039;t roll a 6-8 to I said. 

[ImageID=2661057 medium]
Phew! That&#039;s an enemy retreat.

I now held all 5 objectives. Victory.

[ImageID=2661059 medium] 
Apparently, that makes me a better military leader than Napoleon. :shake:

:thumbsup: The sweeping epic feel you get from this game.

:thumbsup: Forces you into some tough decisions.

:thumbsup: You have to blend strategy, bravery and luck to win.

:thumbsdown: I think it was [user=kerskine][/user] who said this game felt too easy.  I&#039;m not at that point yet but 3 wins in 4 plays (including the notoriously hard 1798 campaign) may mean he is on to something.

:thumbsdown: That combined with the very specific campaigns is starting me thinking that this will be a once through the campaigns type game like PACG: Rise of the Runelords. 

This now might not end up as high on my [geeklist=189816]Top 20[/geeklist] as originally thought because of those two reasons but just like PACG I will enjoy it whilst it&#039;s here.</body>

I&#039;m surprised you find it so easy! You must have better strategy or luck than myself :)

I do hear that a few of the last campaigns have some nice replayability, so perhaps this will still stay in there!

I used up a ton of luck to win the 1798 campaign so easy might not be totally accurate.

I&#039;m not complaining. If I manage to maintain a 75% win rate (which I doubt) it won&#039;t put me off playing this. I&#039;m loving it.

I think my biggest fear is replayability so if it&#039;s true some of the later campaigns give it that then I&#039;m pleased as punch.

Just played the 1805 campaign and lost because I ran out of time.  I made a mistake by keeping Napoleon in the north and by attacking Vienna without him and my full force.

I then lost Munich at the end of the penultimate turn.

[ImageID=2662421]

This was the situation at the start of the final turn.  Victory was impossible so I decided to concede.

Turns out it might not be as easy to beat as I thought. :shake:

Ahhh, the infamous battle of Austerlitz. Not such a cakewalk now, huh Nappy! Welcome to the club :)

I don&#039;t remember my last session but I wrote that it was an official loss but I considered it a win, for some reason. On to 1806 for me!

Did you just admit to counting losses as wins?  

I need to start doing that.  It would really help my win percentage.

Do you do it for all games or just this? 

Do wins still count as wins?

Does this give you a 100% win rate? ;)

(I&#039;m just lashing out because fate/karma/whatever just punched me in the face for getting cocky.) :D

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing a one-character run-through of RotR with just the Barbarian Amiri.  It has shown me how different this game is when you play 1-character versus 3-6 characters.  It is much quicker and you really have a different strategy, not only in how you approach each scenario, but also in how you use your cards and in how you improve your character.

Just when I thought I could put these games away, I have a new way to play!  (Admittedly, the physical copy is put away as I play this on CardWarden, but you get the idea.)</body>

For those of you who play with a single character, any recommendations for which characters work well?

I used just one on my first attempt and it didn&#039;t go very well.  I think it might have been a wizard like female character.

I&#039;m playing Merisiel - the rogue/thief. She has some weaknesses, like low wisdom, but has some advantages for soloing, too. I expect all of the characters have their weaknesses, so they could all run into trouble going solo. But some do seem better suited to acting in concert with other characters. (that&#039;s not based on playing them; just on reading stats and stories)

I also follow the suggestions in the rule book on going solo.

	<body>I&#039;ve been waiting for a friend to return my &#039;Shadows of Mirkwood&#039; adventures packs, as I&#039;ve been wanting to go back and replay each expansion with an appropriately themed deck and give it a rating. However, he&#039;s been really busy recently and after reading so many LOTR: LCG entries on the list, I couldn&#039;t wait any longer :D. I decided to start at Khazad-Dúm, and will return to Mirkwood as and when my mate&#039;s able to return the adventure packs.

The LOTR: LCG was the first game that I really got into when I first discovered the hobby. The aforementioned mate and I got together (literally) every weekend for months just to play this game, before we slowed down to the point of it gathering a bit of dust - and it hits the table much more often as a solitaire game nowadays.

It&#039;s been a [b]long[/b] time since I&#039;ve played the earlier expansions, so I spent a decent part of this morning building an &#039;all-purpose&#039; Spirit and Tactics dwarf deck, led by Óin, Thalin and Nori:

[center][ImageID=2661047][/center]
[center][ImageID=2661046medium][/center]

I was pretty pleased with the deck; very few events, relying more heavily on allies and attachments to overcome the perils within the city beneath the Misty Mountains...

By the fourth turn of the first scenario, things looked a little like this:

[center][ImageID=2661048medium][/center]

During the next questing phase I revealed the &#039;Dark and Dreadful&#039; treachery card. As I was at a Dark location I had to deal two damage to all my exhausted characters - which wiped out all my heroes in one fell swoop!:D

However, I still had faith in my deck - so after a second attempt, and some truly awful encounter cards coming very early, I just managed to scrape a win after losing two heroes:

[center][ImageID=2661268large][/center]

Anyway - still a few hours before my other half is back from work, so there&#039;s definitely time to try and tackle the second scenario!

	<body>I&#039;ve been playing far too much [thing=90215]Skyrim[/thing] recently so I decided to set myself a goal. I am going to play 1 game of Eldritch Horror against each of the Ancient Ones in the base game before I play any more computer games. The number works out nicely to complete that game in my 10x10 challenge.

[b]Game 1 - Azathoth[/b]
I played using Norman Withers and Leo Anderson using a mix of all the Mythos cards. I ended up facing 5 tentacle cards and 2 Elder Sign cards plus 5 normal cards. As I&#039;m sure you can tell, it was quite difficult. I managed to defeat Azathoth with my 2 investigators intact but had I of needed 1 more round then the world would have been devoured.

The first mystery - Omen of Devastation - was probably the hardest one to complete (it certainly took the longest to complete). I don&#039;t generally close gates or attack monsters unless I absolutely have to. The starting gate and the second one drawn were both red Omens so I planned on attacking them early on once the Omen marker reached that Omen (as that is a requirement of the mystery). Unfortunately, the first investigator became delayed and was unable to reach the gate in time and the second investigator failed the test so could not close the door but did get rid of the monster. With the Omen marker advancing there was little point in closing the gate until it came back around so the investigator remained in that area trying to gain clues while the other investigator carried on moving around the board to advance their skills. Once the omen marker moved back round The gate was closed and the mystery solved.

The second mystery - Seed of the Daemon Sultan - only took 2 turns to complete. The first turn involved one of the investigators getting 1 space away and the second turn he moved to the space and succeeded with the test. While this was going on, the second investigator closed 2 empty gates that were close together.

The third mystery - The True Name - took 3 further turns but that was just how long it took to get to the location. The investigator that hadn&#039;t solved a mystery but had several clues arrived first and spent the clues to complete the mystery. The final Mythos card was tough but didn&#039;t advance the Doom marker so all was good.

At the end of the game the Doom marker was on 2 and both investigators were fairly healthy. From about the 5th turn on Star Spawn and Dark Young were both in play and one of the investigators had a Dark Pact so every time I had to roll the dice during the Mythos phase I was worried about seeing those low numbers. The last turn in particular would have been the worst one. The monsters could have taken the Doom marker down to 0 and the Dark Pact could also have killed off an investigator.

RESULT = WIN

:thumbsup: - The game felt challenging but never impossible.
:thumbsdown: - Some of the &quot;easy&quot; Mythos cards are tougher than the &quot;hard&quot; Mythos cards.
:thumbsdown: - The positioning of objectives can have a huge impact into the difficulty of completing a Mystery.

[b]Game 2 - Yog Sothoth[/b]
This time I used Mark Harrigan and Lola Hayes. The Mythos cards were not as bad but the dice were far worse. I completed all 3 mysteries but not before Yog Sothoth awoke. One of the investigators was then devoured leading to the investigators losing the game.

The first mystery - Spawn of Yog Sothoth - was fairly easy but, due to the positioning of the investigators and the first Mythos card drawn (an ongoing card that prevented gates being closed), took me 8 turns to complete. Mark was the perfect person to complete that mystery but was also in the best position to complete the ongoing Mythos card. He was also nowhere near a clue so could not complete the Mythos card and for some reason I didn&#039;t think to solve the mystery first. Lola failed to solve a clue 4 3 turns running and in the end gave up trying. Instead she started trying to tackle some of the monsters at the gates. Mark eventually managed to gain a clue and solve the Mythos card before completing the first mystery 2 turns later.

The second mystery - Arcane Understanding - started off difficult as neither investigator had spells. After a couple of turns they had both managed to gain spells and clues so on the following turn the both performed the spell&#039;s action and complete that mystery. By this point doom was down to 3 and things were not looking good.

The third mystery - The Beyond One - only took 2 turns to complete and that was only because of where each investigator needed to get to in order to help solve the mystery. Unfortunately, before the mystery could be solved I had to complete the Mythos phase. Doom advanced by 3 and Yog Sothoth awoke. The mystery was solved so all I had to do was solve the Final Mystery.

The final mystery was very quick. Lola was next to a gate so moved to it and failed the test causing her to be devoured and doom to be advanced (a gate added to Yog Sothoth). Mark moved to within 1 space of a gate but could not get to it so had to complete a random encounter. The Mythos card caused the Omen track to move around and 2 more doom to be added. With 3 doom (gates) on Yog Sothoth the investigators lost the game. I looked at the next special encounter card to see if Mark would have won the game and he would have successfully passed the tests.

RESULT = LOSS

:thumbsup: - Despite causing me to lose, the Mythos cards were much nicer this time.
:thumbsdown: - This time I never felt like I had a chance of winning. The dice rolls were just not going my way and Doom seemed to advance every turn.
:thumbsdown: - For my style of play I&#039;m not sure Lola Hayes is a good character to play with. She was randomly drawn but if I was choosing characters then I would not pick her.</body>

Too funny, I just setup my first game of this ever last night and drew the same first mystery :cry: I have to ask is this a particularly hard mystery or are they all this difficult? I&#039;ve been spinning my wheels trying to get the [-]moons[/-] Omen track aligned to make any progress. I feel like I&#039;m 6 or 7 Mythos cards deep and still on this first mystery.

Edit: Almost forgot...on top of that, the very first Mythos card I drew spawned an epic spider thing that i have to kill before the eldritch tokens run out or I straight up lose the game :W::T::F: :D

Good times.

Yay a fellow Scarlets fan (I&#039;m assuming you are a Scarlets fan) there are dozens of us.

I started playing it about the same time and have lost entire days to it. I decided enough was enough as I have barely played any board games this month.

It took me 7 turns to complete that Mystery. I would say it is the hardest one you face against Azathoth but if you get the right gates and monsters then I&#039;m sure it is fairly easy. I would also say, for me, this is the hardest Ancient One you can face in the base game as you lose if he wakes up.

It seems that most of the ongoing Mythos cards I draw are ones that cause you to lose the game whenever the Eldritch tokens run out. Some of them are easier to solve than others though.

I grew up with a Welsh family, but still have more than just a soft spot for the Scarlets. Spent most of my adult life in London though, so keep much more up to date with the English Premiership nowadays.

	<body>Now that this is sitting on the top of the pile, I find I&#039;m drawn to it much more.  The quick setup time helps too :)

Either I was really lucky this time or I&#039;m starting to get this game.  MacKenzie didn&#039;t have a chance.

The key this time was discovering just how powerful Tetoharsky is.  He can move you up to nine mountain spaces a turn without spending a single resource!  I managed to breeze through both mountain ranges with fully laden boats, then spend some fur/equip to recruit a good card, and then immediately use Tuttle to build some canoes before continuing the journey along the river before camping with empty canoes.

I used an even more card-heavy strategy than last time, only using Indians for Tetoharsky&#039;s skill.  I had a team of ten cards at the end having recruited Tuttle (1 wood -&gt; 1 canoe), Tetoharsky (1 Indian -&gt; 1 mountain per 3 resource in boats), Broken Arm (1 equip -&gt; 1 horse), Comcomly (1 wood + 1 fur + 1 equip + 1 food -&gt; 7 river), and Cut Nose (+1 mountain).

I realised a few turns after starting that I wasn&#039;t concentrating when setting up the game, so MacKenzie started in the same space as me.  I made my final camp no less than 7 spaces past the finish line with MacKenzie a further 12 (twelve!) spaces back.  Far and away my best result :cool:</body>

This is a great combo deck (although I&#039;m not a big fan of Tetoharsky in the solo mode because it is harder to get indians on the table).
One time I had in my deck Bronken Arm and Ebenezer Tuttle (1wood -&gt; 1 canoe). Those two plus Joseph Barter (1 canoe -&gt; 5 river spaces) and some cards with 3printed indians allowed me to beat MacKenzie by 12 spaces also (by I began on the easiest mode ahaha)

You won though even if it was the &quot;hard&quot; mode, since that merely has McKenzie 7 spaces ahead of you. He had 5 more to go!

as this month´s theme is waiting 
(and since the last post about [listitem=4118518]into the woods[/listitem] had a few comments from people liking the art but fearing the printing and glueing)

i would like to propose the following [b]waiting situation[/b]: 


i´ll build two more copies of [thing=181456][/thing] and send them to two people randomly chosen from anybody who voiced interest in the comments below (until the end of this week). 

those two then have to wait for me to finish the building...
go the the post office...
and for Austrian mail to deliver eventually..! :)

They make vellum just for inkjet printers.  I ordered some off Amazon.  It&#039;s on my doorstep (in the 106 degree heat!) just waiting for me to get home.  (If I don&#039;t melt first.)

For those of you who don&#039;t win...I can say from first-hand experience that this is quite easy to put together.  I used inkjet vellum and 60 lb. card stock and everything printed great, assembled great.  I used tacky glue (for crafting) and it really did come out nice.  Just some printing, a little cutting, a little folding, a little gluing.  I&#039;m not crafty *at all* and I thought this was easy and enjoyable to put together.  Just sayin&#039;... :)

	<body>Played with the Ravage and started with with 6 vitality cards desolute side up. Added a little bit of tension, when a few Ravage cards came out one after another, but not enough that it drastically changed my play, or the game&#039;s difficulty - Might have gotten lucky with having a hand full of elephants during a period where I was drawing Ravage card after Ravage card. Cycled through my deck far faster than I&#039;ve done previously due to how many Owls I accidentally wound up with in it.

Might try mixing things up with one of the real expansions next time, or shift to the 2 card draw rather than the three card draw means of upping difficulty.

:thumbsup: The game seems to hold up despite me finding it far too easy
:thumbsdown: It might be harder to figure out how to up the difficulty sufficiently to feel challenging than it is to win.
:thumbsdown: Owls might be overpowered if the recruitment phase allows you to get a fair few into your deck, since suddenly you&#039;re able to thin your deck into a lean, mean, fighting machine since you lose one (random) or two (of your choice) cards whenever you shuffle your deck - I had thought that would be a cost previously, so expected the Owls to be about as powerful as the Fish - 3 for 2 which is multiuse rather than just for energy, but which forces you to lose cards faster, but... I think that might have been upside rather than downside, at least in the game I just played.</body>

	<body>Played using Andrew Watson&#039;s [filepage=121756]Evolutama[/filepage] solo variant. This game fits this month&#039;s theme of Waiting for me, since I&#039;ve been waiting for a chance to get Evolution to the table since my first play of it soon after my KS edition of it arrived, on account that my fiance doesn&#039;t enjoy the game, and during this week a link to Andrew&#039;s solo variant was posted somewhere I subscribe.

...And I lost by a landslide, after being crippled early on in the game when it decided to pump up it&#039;s BS of all it&#039;s species the turn I decided to make one of mine a carnivore, which set me back sufficiently that I never really recovered (I think if I had more experience I could have probably recovered, and if not that&#039;s a fault of the game rather than the solo variant in question) Quite like the way this solo variant functions, all being told.

Difficulty wise, this variant seems fine - this is the second time I&#039;ve played Evolution, and the first time was a half game, so being crushed by the bot is fair enough.

:thumbsup: Very smooth AI to run, with enough randomness to be unpredictable (And enough randomness to absolutely hose you if it decides to) but one that definitely plays to a &#039;plan&#039; within that random framework.
:thumbsdown: Currently the info needed to run the Evolutama is spread across a couple of pages of the PDF file, but that should be easily fixable even if it doesn&#039;t get fixed by Andrew in future versions.
:thumbsdown: The Automa makes the tablehogginess of Evolution significantly worse, since now you need to have two players worth of creatures in easy reach of you, which means they&#039;re going to start running into each other, fast.</body>

	<body>I have been waiting to see if the Houston Astros are going to be legitimate contenders in baseball this year. In other words, waiting for them to fail. I have been pleasantly surprised!

I designed a Baseball Highlights: 2045 challenge using a constructed deck premise. You can find the details here:
[listitem=4128682][/listitem]

This was my play-through of the Medium difficulty deck.

Game 1: Win 3-0. Between the automated player and myself, we had 8 cards + one Visitor Save card that canceled hits, turned hits into walks, and removed base runners. This was a very low-scoring game considering the fire-power in play. Rarely can I keep the automated player scoreless. I was ready to have much higher scoring games for the next two.

Game 2: Win 8-6. Barry Sosa was poised to knock in 4 runs for the automated player in the bottom of the 6th inning. CC Clemens canceled his hits! Nice.

Game 3: Win 8-7. Mickey Maris hit a single and home run in the 6th and my defense held off the automated player for tight win. Overall, there was very little defense in this game.

Game 4: Win 6-2. I had 5 players cancel hits or remove runners out of my 6 at bats + Visitor Save. I wiped out what would have been a major offensive effort by the automated player.

[ImageID=2661745 large]
Result: A series sweep and one of my most convincing victories in the solo variant of this game!

Please join in the challenge and get yourself ready for the playoffs and World Series.</body>

	<body>I have now completed three chapters (i.e., missions) in the campaign, and am enjoying this game quite a bit.  The first chapter was very basic, but two and three had some interesting tricks that showed imaginative uses of the villain rules and the board.  My characters are all sporting upgraded abilities, and I found a very useful item on a Side Quest [o]Fear Gas Grenade, that will cause all figures in a space to either fall down or run away, unless I roll a 1[/o] that Pog will carry.  But I am running into tougher villains, and each chapter has rules to create the Event and Villain activation decks so as to up the challenge.

I&#039;m actually tempted to pause my campaign here in order to paint the minis to increase my enjoyment of the final four chapters.  I see no issue in replaying the campaign, as it will not play out exactly the same and I can a few things to adjust the difficulty level.

I played the first scenario three times to get the rules right and it was quite different each time.  All it takes is one set of dice rolls to go your way or not go your way and the entire face of the board changes.  2nd Chapter is almost set up on the table for me to play.

I can see how I&#039;d always want to take Milo on a run.  He has both AOE and healing effects that can be indispensable.  He also has been the one that seems to always be the one taking the most damage.

I was a bit confused about Doorstop at first, as the wording on the card implies he can only move without assistance from Pog.  But on the forum it was confirmed that he can take his own attack action; the limitations are for moving only.  This then leaves Pog free to do his own action.

Wait, is Gorman deWulfe in this game?  Do they actually use characters from the Iron Kingdoms stories/fluff?

No one named that so far.  The four heroes have different names.  What kind of character is he?  

By the way, given the flexibility of the board and rules, I can easily see this spawning $30 expansion sets, which I would buy in a heartbeat.

He&#039;s an alchemist.  Now that I zoom in I don&#039;t see his hat, so maybe they just reused the sculpt.

Yes that does look familiar.  In the game, the alchemist is named Milo Boggs.

	<body>After winning against the Medium difficulty constructed deck in my challenge (see previous entry for the details), it was time for the Hard difficulty. Wow! This automated team was tough.

Game 1: Win 5-2. I managed to cancel hits with 2 cards and pick off runners with 2 cards to keep the automated player at bay. My deck will be thin on defense for the next two games. Good start.

Game 2: Loss 4-10. Yeah, I was in trouble the whole game. The automated player had too many hits. And then his runners were fast and faster! I licked my wounds and got ready for the third game in the series. You need a short memory in sports!

[ImageID=2661752 large]

Game 3: Loss 6-10. I was challenged to put up any offense. Mickey Maris hit a single and then a grand slam home run in the 2nd to account for most of my runs. I couldn&#039;t slow down the automated player with his multiple hit players. This series is going to end quickly if I don&#039;t do better than this on defense.

Game 4: Win 8-7. I was ahead in a defensive struggle when Bucky Tulo tied it for the automated player in the bottom of the 6th, 5-5. We both scored 2 runs in the 7th, before I managed to eek across a runner in the 8th to win. This was definitely the highlight game of the series. Both teams played well, but I was able to hit when I needed to.

Game 5: Loss 7-8. My team was doing well, but then Big Mo hit a &quot;Quick Eye&quot; homer (followed by 3 singles) to score 3 runs for the automated player. I tried, but never quite caught up. Did Big Mo kill my team&#039;s chance for glory? Could they come back again?

Game 6: Win 7-2. Yes, the team could come back. I drew 6 Free Agents for my hand and coasted to an easy win. The automated player did not have a chance. Now the question was, did I have enough power left in my deck to win the seventh and decisive game?

[o]Game 7: Both defenses played well and kept it tight. I managed to pull ahead 4-3, only to see Barry Sosa come up to the plate in the 5th with two runners on base. This would mean a 4 run inning and a series win for the automated player. My only hope was to cancel the hits. My last card was CC Clemens, who cancels all hits by Naturals!! My superior forecasting of when to play cards left me with the only card in my deck that would save the game. Win 5-3. A series win for my team!![/o]

Please join in the challenge and create your own fantastic story. Have fun!</body>

Same here :)
I don&#039;t understand a thing about baseball, although I saw a live match with an expert who tried his best to explain the main rules... I missed the single home-run of the match : I was out of the stadium queuing for some corn... :(

My excuse is that I can&#039;t find it on this side of the Atlantic.... Which leaves us [gameid=166317] to play with ;)

	<body>Just wrapped up my first 3 conference training scenario with a Churchill wins tiebreaker; Churchill and Stalin were tied on 38 points, with Roosevelt/Truman trailing close behind with 37.

Germany had surrendered, the US had the A-bomb however the USSR had not entered Manchuria - I was all set to make it happen but forgot about the USSR declares war on Japan conditional issue - and so Japan did not surrender which led to a condition 3 endgame.

Progressing the Pacific and CBI fronts proved tricky. That said it seems all of the allied fronts requires a concerted, combined allied effort for them to progress easily.

Curiously Stalin, and his crew, were pretty strong during all three conferences with their debating characteristic proving handy. Indeed they won both of their global issues! Also the US and UK spent a fair bit of time worrying about the colonies but Stalin kept snatching the issue away from them.

An interesting and thought provoking game.  

The bots offer useful guidelines to the solo player but I found myself more frequently just playing each in a manner that seemed logical, at least to me anyway!

I just bought this for myself as a present for getting a paycheck (heh, makes no sense), and am working through the rules.  Upon first read the conferences section SEEMS uninteresting, but the rest of the game sounds cool.  I&#039;m really excited about trying it out in the next few days.

Notes/Comments:
9/07 - Game 1: It&#039;s been a few days since I played this, so I can&#039;t remember all the details. I didn&#039;t get around to posting till today. My first game was really just to go through the motions to figure things out. Ended with 18 points on the score track, +6 for a set, -18 for losing my ship, sled, and all people, -34 for empty spots, for a total of -28.

9/07 - Game 2: Did a little better this time: Ended with 22 points on the score track, +6 for a set, -8 for losing my sled with 3 people, -38 for empty spots, for a total of -18
Only improved by 10. I&#039;m starting to think the solo game is less about getting to the passage and more about exploration and getting back to Greenland by round 10?

I&#039;ve only played it correctly twice, though I was doing movement correctly, more or less, but I am able to get to the Passage and back for the most part. I think the secret is in how many you send on the sled and when you go to collect them.

I&#039;ll give that a try next time. And, as far as I know, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m playing right. I read almost every rules forum just to make sure. I&#039;ll probably reread the rulebook one more time to just be sure too, not that it&#039;ll take long or anything. :)

You guys weren&#039;t kidding about the relatively huge box.

Seems like a fun puzzle, I&#039;m glad I got it and looking forward to playing it more.

First score? 35 if I&#039;m counting correctly.

I&#039;ll have to check out the PBF :)</body>

I bought the import version since it was all I could find, and downloaded the English rules.

Good luck with your trade, but don&#039;t be afraid of the import!

	<body>Two entente and two axis pilots slogged it out in the azure skies over a battered French landscape. Joseph Jacobs in his Albatros traded shots with Harold Stackard&#039;s Camel for most of the battle. In fact, the two pilots took each other out in the same turn, their planes pummeled past the breaking point. 

That left the Red Baron in his signature red Fokker and Georges Madon in his Spad. The Baron had a number of points of damage but Madon only had 1. They danced past each other performing Immelmann after Immelemann, the wind whistling over their plane&#039;s wings. Hoping to break the standoff Madon, swung to his left, miscalculated the distance, and ending up leaving the field of battle.

My first WoG skirmish. I used the solo player app on my android tablet to run the Axis players, which worked pretty well. They won, technically, so it obviously played better than I did. 

Much too early to have a real opinion but I enjoyed it. Multiplayer this would rock though. The trash talking would be most excellent. :D

edit - as a PSA, please be aware that the linked item is just the rules, you would need to purchase minis in addition to this to play.</body>

The downside (outside of cost) is availability, unless you&#039;re like me and the hunt itself becomes part of the game. :)

	<body>[IMG]http://www.superiorpics.com/movie_pictures/mp/1987_Predator/1987_predator_017.jpg[/IMG]

Got my first game of this in. Took on the first move in the jungle. Things started off good enough, working my way through the first objective with not much problem.

[o]The first objective is pretty clever. You have to take out the guerrilla camp, which attaches to the Wilds. You only need 1 attack to do it, but it has to be in an empty space. But cards are always shifting it around, so it&#039;s harder to get a hold of than you might think.

I very much liked this mechanic. Finally I had enough attack to scan a card and kill it, which, when it dies, lets me move the camp (if out) to the left. Doing that put it in an empty space and I had one attack left to level the place.[/o]

The second objective deck started showing up before I&#039;d finished the first, though, and that was going to be tough. Plus, the hazards were piling up on me causing all sorts of problems.

[o]The hazards, which I guess aren&#039;t really spoilers since they show up on the open objective card, but whatever, anyway the hazards attach to the player that flips them up (all me), and then move cards directly to the combat area. First one, then two. That clears the Wilds a bit, but the strikes definitely piled up while I sifted for good cards.[/o]

At this point my deck was at least doing it&#039;s thing. I had lots of red-arrow-symbol-thing cards, meaning I could use Sexual Tyrannosaurus to heal up strikes pretty often. 

[IMG]http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_3rfAjpHOyI/maxresdefault.jpg[/IMG]

My main damage was from a bunch of 2-attack cards I&#039;d bought, and using the Brothers in Arms trait to power up one of the Dutch cards.

Objective 2 was completed quickly, making me feel like I had some time to try and get a hold of the Wilds before things got bad.

[o]Objective two is to set up a defensive position. When the objective comes out, it sits to the side and you have to pay 6 recruit to attach it and finish it off. I just got a lucky draw with all my recruit cards.[/o]

Things then got bad. I started taking strike after strike, and couldn&#039;t keep up with the healing.

[IMG]https://toomanyposts.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/predator-face-off.jpg?w=590[/IMG]

[o]Objective 3 is &quot;survive.&quot; According to the rules, I can kill the predator or use some other Minor Victory card. Never saw either, as I couldn&#039;t stay on top of the stream of bad guys. There were cards that cause strikes even in the Wilds. Another hazard moved more people to the combat zone. Eventually they overcame me and that was it.[/o]

I looked for a picture of what happened next, but they were all a little too violently graphic. It didn&#039;t end well.

--------------------------------

I enjoyed the play. I like the difficulty, that seemed good. There are a few oddities though. For one, the card that you get with your Role requires someone to coordinate with you in order to be used. I don&#039;t like to play 2-handed, so not only are all the coordinate cards not that good for me, now ALL of the roles are blank. All of them.

That seems harsh for solo players. The loss of coordinate is one thing, and I think it helps make the solo game harder, which is good. But losing the entire effect of different roles is a real bummer.

Also, you still start with a 13 card deck. Like Alien. However, the unique card you get does not let you draw a card. So unlike Alien, your starting deck is not a multiple of the cards you draw per turn.

That means you&#039;ll draw 6, use them, draw 6, use those, and then draw 1 and have to shuffle and draw 5 more. I guess that&#039;s fine? It&#039;s just odd. It&#039;s the first deckbuilder I&#039;ve played that does that.

I like the art generally better than Alien. Some of it is still pretty bad, and often times the characters don&#039;t look the way the characters look. Which would be fine if this wasn&#039;t based on an actual visual license where we know exactly what the characters look like because they were in a movie. It&#039;s not like someone having to interpret Tolkien or something. But the Predator art is all pretty good.

I do think I&#039;ll enjoy this one even more when it comes to multiplayer play. The coordinate cards look fun, and the role cards that key off of that mechanic look really fun as well. There were also lots of things that multiple players could all chip in on, which was cool.

For the strictly solo player, though, you&#039;re getting half the game. There&#039;s two movies, not four, so there&#039;s not as much to do. However, you can play both movies as the Predator as well. So there&#039;s just as many cards, and two whole games in the box, but the Predator mode is a competitive mode requiring opponents.

Unless, shameless plug, you join us for [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/20117951#20117951]PREDATOR GOLF[/url]. I&#039;m giving away over 400:gg:, so come win some. I&#039;ve been coming up with some crazy hole ideas as well, see what sorts of bizarre ways we can compete using the same cards.

Since I played this once this month, I&#039;ve got to get two more plays of it at least. That&#039;s the rule. I&#039;m looking forward to them! </body>

The loss of roles is very dissapointing and I already thought that coordinate was already far too prevalent in Alien, making solo play feel more limited as a result, but also felt that in a two-handed or two-player game coordinate was insanity over-powered.

Maybe a pass is in order here? Only time will tell as more people report in.

I feel up and down about it. For one, the role cards do have attack and recruit. So they aren&#039;t dead cards, they&#039;re still pretty good. The role card I used had the Call for Backup ability (meaning, I can use it if someone coordinates with me) of letting me pull a card from my discard and put it on top of my deck.

It also had 2 attack, though. Which is great for a starting card. So it never felt completely useless. Keep in mind that even playing multiplayer, this ability won&#039;t be used every time you have the card because someone will have to coordinate with you. So playing one-handed, you&#039;re going from using it only sometimes to using it none times.

On top of that, one of my biggest criticisms of Alien is that the role card didn&#039;t really do all that much. You use it a few times during the game, it&#039;s power isn&#039;t something you can depend on, it doesn&#039;t really differentiate you all that much from the other roles, and it&#039;ll get drowned out by the time your deck is really getting going. All of those are true of Predator, too, so I can&#039;t really lament the loss of something that I didn&#039;t think was all that huge to begin with. Only difference being that the abilities on these roles look way fun, and I hate to miss them.

You can fix this simply by playing 2-handed. Which, if the posts on the game&#039;s difficulty are to be believed, might even be necessary to do well. Or, you could just say that you can trigger your own Call for Backup ability if you play a card with coordinate on your turn, making both the role and coordinate just a little bit useful.

Overall, though, I wouldn&#039;t say that the loss of the roles is a deal breaker. I liked the scenario quite a bit, it felt more like the predator movie than any of the Aliens scenarios felt like Alien movies to me. It was brutal and close and fun.

Looking forward to doing some golfing! I&#039;ll post the first hole soon, but I won&#039;t put up a due date until well after people have their games.

I use that house rule playing the Alien version. It allows me to attack Ash when he appears.

Me too.  I&#039;m really interested in that challenge.  In fact it&#039;s one of the reasons I bought the game as quickly I did.

Thanks for organising it.

Finally got my copy today, and after what seems like 40 days in the desert got the cards sleeved and sorted. :)

Just looking through the cards, what struck me most was that the Predator player decks all seem to be monochromatic, which is a change from both Marvel and Alien, IIRC. Not sure yet how it&#039;s going to impact gameplay (if at all), as I didn&#039;t look to closely at the abilities on the cards, but it did jump out at me.

Looking forward to the golf challenge!

	<body>I have been waiting a long time to get good at this game...and I&#039;m still waiting :D.

I got a score of 207. I got the mason&#039;s guild after the first round and in the third round the fish restaurant so I tried a building strategy without using ships, except the last ship (luxury liner in English I think). And for food I used the fish pond, fish smokery and fish restaurant. In hindsight I probably should have used the fish combo even more instead of building the luxury liner.

:thumbsup: Beautiful game, I really like the artwork
:thumbsup: Playtime including set up takes about 90 min
:thumbsup: A classic game that deserves a place in any collection

:thumbsdown: Not an easy game (for me at least) and no luck involved</body>

	<body>Picked this up from the post office last night and got in my first two games of it.

Played the Crossfire mission using the Ork and Elf.  Not surprisingly I lost both times.

[ImageID=2662589 medium]The end... again.

It&#039;s a deck builder but as some have said it&#039;s not one in the traditional sense.

You only add a few cards to your hand and don&#039;t replenish your hand fully every turn so you have to manage your hand a lot more carefully than in other deck builders and buying the biggest and best card available in the market isn&#039;t necessarily the best thing.

I had heard it&#039;s arbitrarily hard and until I play this some more I can&#039;t comment on that.  It does up the difficulty as those crossfire event cards come out though.

I think there may be more to learn here than a normal deck builder.

I knew not to expect the same as a normal deck builder but think I still made some of those errors - e.g. taking my turns quickly.

I need to spend some more time thinking ahead.

No thumbs yet, too early.  I did enjoy the two games though.  Mechanically this is a hit but time will tell if I like the overall experience.</body>

Got this, played one game, and then had to pack it to move. I really enjoyed that one game, though. I think I&#039;ll wait until I get the expansion and then just play this exclusively for a while, campaign-style.

If you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;ll offer up some suggestions. None of these are really spoilers. If you want strategy tips, I can help there as well.

Well I&#039;ll give you one tip. The elf is really tough in a 2-player game because of the low HP start. He also starts with 4 cards which in a weird sense is a disadvantage because you need to play something the first round or you&#039;ll only draw one card. If that makes no sense whatsoever, I can explain, but I&#039;d do it in a geekmail or in spoiler tags.

The first few things are rules that are easy to overlook. 
- When you play with two, you don&#039;t draw a crossfire card the first 2 turns. I think most people get this one right.
- Because each character is playing two roles, they each start with an extra Nguyen (I missed that the first 20 plays. It really helps).
- As soon as you kill all enemies on the board, you immediately bury the crossfire card (not discard it). And you don&#039;t choose another one until the start of the first players turn again. So you may start the next scene with the second player, with no crossfire card in play.

The next thing I&#039;ll tell you is that it&#039;s really easy to get the single karma point for aborting the mission. It may seem a bit fishy, but if you can&#039;t see that you&#039;ll survive the next wave, then let one person go staggered, then critical with only one enemy in front of you. survive it for one round and collect your point. In your case, getting that +1 HP for the elf would be really helpful. Once you get past 10 Karma, you can&#039;t get a point for aborting anymore because of the -1 Karma penalty for 11-20.

I would strongly suggest trying the Extraction mission even if you have no Karma upgrades yet. It has scaling for 1-4 characters and I found it considerably easier to win. (Again don&#039;t forget that if you play with more roles, you get an extra Nguyen for each role. So a solo character starts with 3 extra. Because of assists, I&#039;d never play it with less than 2, but I know some like that. Maybe when you get past 20 Karma and have 2 5pt upgrades or a single 20 point upgrade you can go back to Crossfire. 

I&#039;m now at 118 plays of this and I may always have it setup on a table. I have a small round table that is too small for most games, but it works perfectly for a 2-player game of this.

Kevin, the more I read what you write about this game the more I want it! If I hadn&#039;t ordered [thing=174570][/thing] this week I would order [thing=135382][/thing] right now.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]If you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;ll offer up some suggestions. None of these are really spoilers. If you want strategy tips, I can help there as well.[/q]
I don&#039;t mind at all. Fire away.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]Well I&#039;ll give you one tip. The elf is really tough in a 2-player game because of the low HP start. He also starts with 4 cards which in a weird sense is a disadvantage because you need to play something the first round or you&#039;ll only draw one card. If that makes no sense whatsoever, I can explain, but I&#039;d do it in a geekmail or in spoiler tags.[/q]
That low HP was a killer.

The card thing does make sense.  I was always trying to get down to 3 or less cards so I can draw 2.  The same applies to the Ork who starts with 5. On the rare occassion I had 4 or more I drew none as I can&#039;t find anywhere in the rules (I may be blind) that says you draw 1.  Is that an FAQ.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]The first few things are rules that are easy to overlook. 
- When you play with two, you don&#039;t draw a crossfire card the first 2 turns. I think most people get this one right.
- Because each character is playing two roles, they each start with an extra Nguyen (I missed that the first 20 plays. It really helps).
- As soon as you kill all enemies on the board, you immediately bury the crossfire card (not discard it). And you don&#039;t choose another one until the start of the first players turn again. So you may start the next scene with the second player, with no crossfire card in play.[/q]
- Got that right.
- Forgot that both times.  Thanks.
- I buried the card but started with the first player again even if they shouldn&#039;t have. Thanks again.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]The next thing I&#039;ll tell you is that it&#039;s really easy to get the single karma point for aborting the mission. It may seem a bit fishy, but if you can&#039;t see that you&#039;ll survive the next wave, then let one person go staggered, then critical with only one enemy in front of you. survive it for one round and collect your point. In your case, getting that +1 HP for the elf would be really helpful. Once you get past 10 Karma, you can&#039;t get a point for aborting anymore because of the -1 Karma penalty for 11-20.[/q]
I couldn&#039;t keep the second character alive through the abort run either time.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]I would strongly suggest trying the Extraction mission even if you have no Karma upgrades yet. It has scaling for 1-4 characters and I found it considerably easier to win. (Again don&#039;t forget that if you play with more roles, you get an extra Nguyen for each role. So a solo character starts with 3 extra. Because of assists, I&#039;d never play it with less than 2, but I know some like that. Maybe when you get past 20 Karma and have 2 5pt upgrades or a single 20 point upgrade you can go back to Crossfire.[/q]
I&#039;ll try extraction.  I avoided it because of the upgrades thing but I will give it a go. I like the assist thing too so for the moment I&#039;m going to play it two handed.

[q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]I&#039;m now at 118 plays of this and I may always have it setup on a table. I have a small round table that is too small for most games, but it works perfectly for a 2-player game of this.[/q]
I&#039;m still amazed by how much you&#039;ve played this and how I didn&#039;t even notice for ages.  You are a secret shadowrunner. :D

You&#039;re correct sorry. No draw if you have more than 3 cards. Lost my mind there. I so rarely have more than 3 after a turn.

On the abort, if you wait until you&#039;re forced to do the abort, then your second character probably isn&#039;t going to make it. If you have two characters low on health and you realize that drawing 4 obstacles in the last scene is going to be insurmountable, then let that last remaining obstacle hit someone twice to critical them. Then the last guy just has to survive that one guy.

Yeah I hear everyone now saying that&#039;s cheesy, but think of it thematically. Would you rush on to a room full of bad guys if you were both bleeding to death? No, you&#039;d abort and live to fight another day. It&#039;s not your fault the rules say you can&#039;t abort until someone is critically hurt. 

As far as extraction. Some things to remember. 
- The client has to survive through to the end of the 6th round. (The 7th one says you win!). 
- You don&#039;t have to kill everything. You just have to survive long enough and keep the client alive.
- Read through the steps so you know when healing is coming.
- Regardless of the number of players, you don&#039;t get any Crossfire free rounds so start drawing from the beginning. My win percentage at this scenario with 2 and 4 players is probably around 80%. I did have at least 5 points in Karma upgrades though, so you may not do as well, but it&#039;s still easier than Crossfire.
- Remember the Client is a human runner so everything that refers to runners applies to him (runner with most hits, runners take a hit ...)
- Also remember that if he draws an obstacle that says &#039;you&#039; can&#039;t buy cards or draw cards or whatever other restriction, well that&#039;s a good thing because the client doesn&#039;t have any cards or Nguyen and he doesn&#039;t share in Nguyen when you kill things. 

Also, if you have the time search on youtube for &quot;shadowrun with the designers&quot; Those 4 videos are fantastic. The last one has them plating Extraction. One color in particular is exceptionally good for extraction. 

Speaking of which, another general hint I&#039;ll give you is that damage is usually better than healing. A mistake a lot of people do is to grab the Doc Wagon card when it isn&#039;t really critical. Kill things and you won&#039;t need as much healing ;)

This may well be my second 10.

 I still recommend mounting the stickers on chipboard and cutting them out so that way you don&#039;t have to wait to upgrade your characters to do the other scenarios

That works or I just write it on the cards with a dry erase marker and don&#039;t worry about the stickers. I can&#039;t bring myself to use them. Your way is definitely prettier.

Welcome to the vicious world of Shadowrun.

My recommendation would be to watch the two player video on YouTube from the Designers of the game. It really shows the mindset that you need to be successful. After watching this, I went from losing to winning! (Although, I still got my butt kicked twice tonight).

Count me among the big fans of this game (I even like it better than Legendary Alien, if I&#039;m honest), and it definitely takes a bit more turn-to-turn tactics than the average deckbuilder, mainly because that Crossfire deck is a killer.

	<body>As part of the big damn robots challenge, I decided to take on the AI at Blood Bowl Team Manager. All four teams were drawn randomly. 

Me   - The Zharr-Naggrund Ziggurats
AI 1 - The Lowdown Rats
AI 2 - Athelorn Avengers
AI 3 - Skavenblight Scramblers

While 1,2 seemed content to frustrate me at every matchup Skavenblight took an early lead as well as picking up The Chaos Cup and The Dungeonbowl. A lack of concentration caught me out in the 3rd round helped 3 with his lead. Forcing me to go all out for fans in rounds until the end. Closing the gap until The Blood Bowl itself. Only one other matchup had any fans so went in heavy on both. By now both Skaven and myself had the mighty Morg &#039;N Thorg .. .. Luckily mine was in my hand so I was able to get him to the Blood Bowl straight out. Using a Medium Bribe I looked at the cheating token I was drawing for him . . . Ejection, so that got discarded I could only hope it&#039;s replacement was better.. 

Time came for the scoreboard phase, the Skaven had Warpstone Souvenirs helping them gain more fans, while I had The Best Players in the League and Endorsement Deal... Carefully went through each highlight saving the tournament for last .. ..

34 - 29 I&#039;d done it !!! Off I went cheery grin to make a celebratory cup of tea. I came back to put it away and then I&#039;d realised !! The bloody contract tokens I&#039;d forgotten to flip and include them. I had two tokens, Skaven had five. 

2&amp;3 gave me 39.
I flipped theirs, 2...2...2...2...2 for 10. 39!! 
[imageid=2662775]
(The moment I thought all was lost)

Time to check improvements .. Skavenblight 8, The Ziggurats 10.

Phew that was the closest I&#039;ve had for a while.

In terms of the challenge that brings it to 1-1</body>

Glad I could help then !
It&#039;s not perfect, you might need to house rule one or things as they pop up, or if you plan on using all of the expansion stuff but it works and is generally good.

Housekeeping and keeping track of everything for all the teams is a bit of work haha

	<body>The problem with solo gaming is that once you get into it, it&#039;s a bit addicting. We have a game group that meets once a week over lunch, and playing a few games with the kids, but I haven&#039;t done any solo games in a week. That&#039;s a bit of a travesty and I miss it.

Had time in my morning routine so I had to get a something out on the table. I haven&#039;t played Gongor Whist for a while, and I really like trick taking games. Yes, a trick taking game for one. And it&#039;s hard....

I thought I was going to do well butI only got 5,6,7 -- none of the rest.</body>

[q=&quot;Cardboard Conundrum&quot;]Hmmmm... a trick taking game for one...? That&#039;s definitely got me interested - can you play with a standard deck of 52 cards?[/q]

You could maybe emulate it.... the Decktet has 6 suits and  36 cards (no face cards equiv) and 2-9 have two suits a piece while Aces and Crowns (10&#039;s) only have one suit.

That said, the BGG page says it&#039;s based off of [thing=31266][/thing] so maybe that would be better. Haven&#039;t tried it, though.

The bit that&#039;s inspired by Oneonta Whist is trick-taking against a dummy hand. The ability to twiddle the trump and the scoring rule that requires getting each bid exactly are original additions in Gongor Whist.

Another go at this one.  Retreated Nimitz on the 1st card to get him ready for a knock-out blow, but he bounced back out of the danger zone on card 2 and never looked back.  DID get MacArthur out of the war for a while, but then the Mid War deck came up and that was pretty much the end of knock out attempts.  Nimitz got to Okinawa and even made a play or 2 for the Home Islands in the MID WAR DECK! (if you don&#039;t have the game that&#039;s bad).

In the end my undoing was having Army/Navy, Prestige and Oil all fall to 0 on the 1st card of the Late War deck.  Game over.</body>

	<body>I really needed to boost my self-esteem after my last game, so I got out Star Realms... this is usually not how I boost my self esteem.

I&#039;ve been fighting the Pirates a lot in [thread=1415265]Star Realms Challenge #10[/thread] by our fellow soloist [user=ShaunGamer]ShaunGamer[/user]. The Pirates have beaten me up enough for a while so I tried the Nemesis Beast to shake it up a little.

I was able to get some Blob Rams for some hard hits and a couple Federation bases to take some of the damage. I got a few rounds of 16 damage on the Beast and ended up winning 9 to -3 in 15 rounds. I usually lose when I go over 10 rounds against the Beast so I&#039;m glad I was able to pull it off.

And then I checked some of my play stats -- this play of Star Realms is my 800th play I have logged at BGG. Seems like a milestone to me. (800th play of all games -- not just Star Realms. :D)</body>

I read that as 800 games of Star Realms.  I bet there are people on BGG who have done that!

Congrats on 800, that&#039;s a nice number.  Here&#039;s to 1000 coming up around the corner!

	<body>[b]Khazad-dum #1: Into The Pit[/b]

Deck 1: Dain Ironfoot, Theodred, Dwalin
Deck 2: Gimli, Thalin, Bifur

Was nice to start a new cycle and mix the decks up a bit with lots of new heroes. The eagles are (mostly) gone with lots of dwarves joining in.

Like the Massing At Osgiliath, things looked bleak early on with the 3rd round loss of Thalin to a Sudden Pitfall (horrid card!). Thankfully Bifur&#039;s ability along with Erebor Record Keeper allowed the dwarves to quest as well as pop back up to defend an attack when needed.

A timely Untroubled By Darkness saw the party through the first stage of the quest. With the enemy forces amassing, a Longbeard Orc Slayer sneak attack followed by him joining the party more permanently the next round saw off all but the Patrol Leader who was soon dispatched by Gimli &amp; Co.

A second Untroubled By Darkness with a little help from Faramir saw the party make a mammoth push passed a Dreadful Gap and on to secure victory.

Result: [b][COLOR=#00CC00]Success![/COLOR][/b]
Final Score: [b]148[/b]</body>

My poor boys kept getting shot to pieces.  I had 4 brigades wiped out before they even got to Bayonet Combat.  The other 5 brigades all captured Union positions, but they were not in a row (you get bonus pts for 4 or 6 adjacent positions captured), so no extra points there.  

Ended up with 78 pts for a Minor Defeat.</body>

	<body>I finally got this game to the table and played my first game today. It was fun, but not great.  I got to move my dudes around the map and kill aliens, which is always fun, but the game felt like this: move, roll dice, move, roll dice, and so on.  However, I&#039;m not going to let this play make up my mind about the game.  I think it was a case where the first mission was simple and basically taught me how to play the game.  There wasn&#039;t much happening that was too exciting and we basically ran around a field with some hills.  But I got to kill some aliens which is always fun.  

I successfully accomplished the mission and nobody died. Mayes and Gaz both leveled up.  Also, Gaz got a sweet healing gun.  Haha, that&#039;s what it feels like.  I can shoot health at a squadmate up to two areas away.  

There was a really cool moment at the end.  I gained the fourth alien fragment, which either gives me an improved weapon or a device.  Gaz was locked in combat with some baddies, so I picked the teleport device.  I was successful at using it and planted Gaz right next to the last T.P. token which he promptly destroyed.  We won!

I play five characters, but that&#039;s only because some missions require you to use exactly five. In my first several learning games I played only three, but by now managing five is a breeze. Excellent game, so much fun.

That&#039;s good to know. I was worried that five might be too many. I think I&#039;ll try them all out in my next game.

Game one, playing the &#039;Extraction&#039; mission did not go well from the start, with some obstacles getting stuck early on, and so I ended up getting overwhelmed with enemies, and my Troll going critical.

Game two went a little better with my two runners holding on until the last round. The draw of the Crossfire card &#039;No Cover&#039; was a cruel blow, as it meant that I had no way of making it through the round without losing, either my Human Decker went Staggered and so went Critical and lost, or my Client became Staggered and I lost, plus my Covering Fire wasn&#039;t going to stop the obstacles!

Next time...</body>

	<body>&quot;Theres something out there waiting for us... and it ain&#039;t no man.&quot;

No. It&#039;s a f**king Parcel Force goon, not doing his job. My wife graciously waited in all day for this to be delivered. It wasn&#039;t. I had to ring up the bloody depot shortly before they shut for the night. Apparently, delivery dates are somewhat &quot;malleable&quot; for some companies. A call to the driver suggested the stuff languishing in the van in his driveway might best be delivered the actual day they&#039;d been paid to. 

My box arrived with a dent... and what looks like a boot-print. (Game box is fine, happily.)

[imageid=2663339large]

Don&#039;t think I&#039;m compus enough to attempt the card sort, past midnight. Looks like we have our first job of the weekend. 

I might be imagining it, but this mat feels a touch flimsier than the Alien one. Mine currently has a slight crease due to the way it was folded in the box... which does make me think crushing the two games into one is going to damage these - at least cosmetically. Might be another shelf-shuffle in order..</body>

I have had my two playmats rolled up tight and in the same box for a week now. Planning to get Predator to the table on Saturday so I will report back on the status of my playmat, will let you know how it held up.

I&#039;m considering trying to roll one inside the other, see if that fits better.

	<body>I dont have loads to add other than that I am pleased that I finally have some solo gaming time again. This summer has been a whirlwind and now that the end is here, im looking forwards to a little more structure and downtime in the evenings. Anyway, just played the first scenario and im in a little bit of awe in how well it works. The AI seemed to always take worthwhile actions that really worked well with the flow of the game. Granted it was a bit clunky because im still learning the new rules and getting a feel for things but I can already see this becoming a favorite.

More to come!

P.S. FOOTBALL!</body>

	<body>Played with first expansion for first time, with the 4 new characters (Paragon, Crusader, Shaman, Monk).  The quests made the game much better than before.  The characters were fun, each contributing in his own way.  The Monk fought, eluded, and searched well.  The Shaman healed everyone and helped the Monk find 3 keys.  The Paragon protected us from blights, and the Crusader killed them, especially when he got the power to travel then attack for a single action.  We were able to kill the Necromancer at the very last moment, with the darkness track at 29!

	<body>While trying to minimize the amount of games on my [geeklist=196079]&quot;unplayed games&quot; - List[/geeklist] the boardgames gods decided to advance preorder deliveries and even kickstarter-deliveries from like 2 years ago to show up this month.

But because it&#039;s a quite a light game I managed to bring it three times to the table this week to count it for myself as played.

Two times with two random chosen characters and to get a feeling of all the included &quot;jobs&quot; last last game with the remaining 3.

[ImageID=2660238]

As far as I see it&#039;s as unforgiving as the bigger brother [thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing] but with even less projectable outcome because of all the dice rolls.

Would I prefer it over the original Pandemic (with no expansions)? Probably not... for that it&#039;s to light and too much dice luck. But yes, still a good dice chucker with a small enough footprint that I can let a bigger game stay on my &quot;gaming table&quot; during the week.

:thumbsup: Nice components
:thumbsup: Plays fast and easy
:thumbsdown: Too much depending on dice luck
:thumbsdown: The dice are just a little bit to small
:thumbsdown: If there&#039;s time I&#039;d always prefer the original Pandemic</body>

	<body>Another expansion for I game I really like and another entry from my [geeklist=196079]&quot;Catch up Month&quot; - Geeklist[/geeklist] I wanted to get to the table well knowing it won&#039;t be done in one session.

So the goal was set to play it three times this week but I wanted to really appreciate the different new parts and mechanics of this expansion.

[ImageID=2660235]

I started without any additional Antarctic material except one of the new Elder One and of course all the new cards for exploration deck, item deck, Prologue cards and so on...

My first run against Ithaqua went quite smooth and as soon as I started to use the new focus action it really started to get easy... The three mysteries were solved in no time and I actually scored my [b]FIRST WIN[/b] in this game.

[ImageID=2660237]

I went on with game two and now included the new board and the second new Elder One card (that triggers the Antarctic map). It first struggled a bit with the first two mysteries and wasn&#039;t sure I&#039;ll make it through the demanded 4 (!!!). But at the end my brave heroes won again :arrrh:

[ImageID=2663752]

To round up the expansion experience I started a third game with the one Prologue-Card that let you use the Antarctic map too... And with a EO I never beat before... Cthulhu himself.

Already looking forward to my third win in a row I started really optimistic into that game. But as it turned out it became a struggle for life and death... One character got insane and the other simply died... With probably the last round I could make it through I managed to keep Cthulhu sleeping and solved the third mystery.
But I have to admit, that I probably wouldn&#039;t have made it if the expedition cards from the expansion would had advance the mysteries at least two times.

[ImageID=2663753]

Overall a really good expansion for a great narrative game.
I found several discussions on the BGG board about how this expansion would make the game easier... And I have to admit that out of my 9 games only the three with the expansion included I was able to win. And yes, with the focus action it feels a little bit easier.

:thumbsup: Great artwork and components quality
:thumbsup: The new board and all the new cards really add tension, replayability and even more fun to the base game.
:thumbsup: It definitely makes it more possible to win.</body>

	<body>I don&#039;t normally post twice in a month about the same game but this definitely deserved a second post.

Played three more games (Crossfire mission) and two other aborted games (one due to not drawing crossfire cards :shake: and one that was going well until at the start of scene three I realised I&#039;d only fought two obstacles in scene two :shake:).

I felt my brain adapting to the game with every play.  I was starting to learn the cards a bit more.  I was starting to think about what I should play this turn and what I could do next turn, as well as what my other character could do on their turn and could they assist me now or me on theirs, what was in the black market that could help us now or maybe later.

The hand management is really important and I love hand management games.  As soon as my brain clicked in to that mode this definitely changed as an experience.

It really is about playing the game rather than the turn which is what most deck builders make you do.  They are all about the now - buy the best card, do the most damage, etc and do it now.  That&#039;s not a criticism, just that they require a different mindset.

This is about planning ahead and deciding what will be better in the long term.  You also have to build taking damage into your thinking.  It&#039;s OK to take some licks and clear your buddy&#039;s obstacles.  Using some cards so they are in your discard pile also helps as you or the other character can use them on the next turn.

Lot&#039;s to think about.  Lot&#039;s of potential here.  

Anyway, in the third game (my fifth overall) I won.

[ImageID=2663763 medium]
It ended like this.

My Dwarf (male) was facing off against the final obstacle in scene three.  A Gunslinger Adept.  You can&#039;t damage him until you discard a weapon or spell card.

Luckily my Troll (female) could assist with &#039;Backdoor&#039; which removed that ability and did 1 damage.

My Dwarf then used &#039;Pair Programming&#039; (2 damage) to play &#039;Black Market Contacts&#039; (1 damage) out of the Troll&#039;s discard pile which also allowed me to buy a black market card immediately and put it in my hand.  I bought &#039;Co-ordinated Assault&#039;.

The Drawf then played 2 x &#039;Mark&#039;, a &#039;Mana&#039; and a &#039;Quick Shot&#039; to finish off the the first three levels of the obstacle.  They used &#039;Co-ordinated Assault&#039; to finish off the next level and that allowed the Troll to draw a card and play a card.  They played &#039;Mana&#039; and the last level was gone.

What a turn (Mage Knight-esque), what a win and what a feeling. I&#039;m now excited to play again.

:thumbsup: A deck builder with a difference.  It combines many of my favourite mechanics to make this feel deeper than most deck builders.

:thumbsdown: It has taken support from people here and the videos by the designers to expose what this game really is about.  That&#039;s a shame as this (after 5 plays anyway) is a real gem if you know what to expect.</body>

Thank you Gary for over-ruling your own rule ([i]&quot;I don&#039;t normally post twice in a month about the same game&quot;[/i]), if I may say so.

I didn&#039;t pay much attention to your previous post, on the basis it&#039;s a deck-building game, but now I&#039;m all &#039;eyes&#039; with this second post.

I guess I&#039;ll spend the evening watching some videos and reading some rules :)

Thanks Delphine.  I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it.

Definitely watch the youtube videos by the designers that everyone suggested to me.  Really helped me understand the game and avoid normal deck building decisions.

This does still have deck building elements but so does Mage Knight.  I wouldn&#039;t call that a deck builder in the sense of Legendary or Star Realms.

You don&#039;t get to scrap cards and some turns even if you can afford it you don&#039;t buy cards.  My Troll bought 8 and my Dwarf 7 in that last game.  In this game it is more about what you buy, when you buy them and when you use them.

Everything Kevin and others have said about this game is right.  Once you realise you aren&#039;t playing a Dominion style deck builder this game comes to life.

	<body>Back in november 2013 when I had just begun to get real interest into board gaming and especially into solitaire gaming I wanted to try something new... I backed a Kickstarter project... with delivery date july 2014... november went by and for the first time I was part of a funded kickstarter project... :D

There was winter, spring and finally summer where the game should have been delivered and from then on I experienced what it can mean to kickstart a game &quot;no infos&quot;, &quot;delays&quot; and so on...

Fast forward 14 month...

This week the parcel service TNT brought that huge heavy box from [company=25585]Marrow Production[/company]. 

I opened it and [size=18]WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!![/size]

I&#039;m really not the &quot;emotional&quot; guy who admires game art or components much longer than the 3 seconds I see them while sorting them out but this game was SO GORGEOUS I just had to take some pictures and post them here even before I played the game itself... I hope you don&#039;t mind :whistle:

Oh, and by the way the pictures taken with my smartphone doesn&#039;t even catch a third of the quality..

[ImageID=2663755]
Huge, heavy box with really good quality cardboard. About 1,5 times the height and length of a Eldritch Horror box.

[ImageID=2663756]
Super detailed minis... I have to say that I ordered the resin versions.

[ImageID=2663757]
Huge boss monsters.

[ImageID=2663758]
Very detailed player minis.

[ImageID=2663759] [ImageID=2663760]
Big modular boards with amazing artwork.</body>

	<body>Played twice last night, both losses, but both very close. The first one the timing of nightmares and the final door in the last few cards came in the wrong order. The second I just ran out of red locations aside suns by the time I got the seventh door out, so couldn&#039;t find the final door.

I think I&#039;m looking to add an expansion into my game - while my win rate so far is 20%, I&#039;d rather not reduce the difficulty. This feels like the &#039;right&#039; difficulty - Pushing but not overwhelming, all the games I&#039;ve lost have been close, and the victory wound up being tight by the end as well. What would people say the expansion module that changes the overall difficulty the least is? Providing enough goodies to whatever nasties it provides to even out the difficulty overall.

:thumbsup: Strong, light, game that repeatedly gives interesting decisions while being relaxing throughout.
:thumbsdown: This game really has a ridiculous amount of shuffling in it. I think I make this point every time I play it.
:thumbsdown: With this many expansion modules it would be helpful to have some sort of guidelines for how each one impacts the difficulty. There is some for the Littlest Incubus appendix module, but...</body>

The only downside to the play was that the holes in the picnic table I was playing on were bigger than the food pieces.  I moved them from box bottom to box top to show used/not used.  Of course, once I dropped one and it fell right through the table onto a cigarette butt.  Exactly why do smokers think that&#039;s the one thing that&#039;s &quot;okay&quot; to litter?

[q]This is probably the only good shot of Pottstown I&#039;ll ever be able to get[/q]

Ha! This had me in stitches. I don&#039;t usually associate Pottstown with parks, but there is definitely some beautiful scenery over in your neck of the woods. Some really neat looking old-school brownstones and other assorted buildings/structures.

Plus, you have the whole Slyfox brewery thing going on over there. I would definitely trade one of our local parks for their brewery and/or their brewpub.

Oh yes, if you head towards the rich side of town, you could get some nice shots of backyards and such; of course they would peg me as an outsider right away and have me burned at the stake or whatever they do to Morlocks.  

And yes.  Slyfox.  Yum.  Sadly just a tad too far to walk, but a quick 5 minutes down the road for a quick pint and some hockey viewing.

And Ichor* on tap the first Friday of every month.  Booya.

	<body>One more time with time to kill, one more solo game of Legendary. Actually I don&#039;t have real time to kill since I have work to do, but laziness is a bitch.
So, using [user=redvulture][/user] randomizer [url=http://tablemonkey.net/Legendary]Wheel of Fate[/url] I ended up with this set up for an Advanced solo mode:
- Heroes: Daredevil, Forge and Moon Knight;
- Mastermind: Loki;
- Villains: Enemies of Asgard and Phalanx.
- Scheme: Replace Earth&#039;s Leaders with Killbots.

It was my first experience with a hero from the Paint the Town Red expansion and I got to say that Moon Knight did an excellent job. His combinations with Forge gave em a lot of power. Daredevil also helped in this fight, but the main role were given to the first two, no doubts.

About Loki and the villains, my main problem were the wounds they got me. Since there was only one kind of cards with [i]Strength[/i] and none with [i]Ranged[/i] I got some wounds along the game. But, at the same time, I recruited a lot of heroes so they were mixed and a lot of times I was able to use them with Forge to discard.

The scheme at first seemed at first seemed way too easy, but then the Killbots started to get more power and when they were 7 I started to be a little worried (I already had one escaped). At the end, with MK and DD rare cards and some combos I was able to defeat Loki without any more escapes.

Final score: 29pt
3 Master strikes occurred
5 Scheme twists revealed
2 Villains escaped

Stop it all of you.  Put the game back in the box and don&#039;t play it until my copy arrives.

Where&#039;s the solidarity? ;)

I just got weak, too and ordered it. So should you! Come now, you know you want to...

And it would make me feel better about me caving in and getting this (plus some more boosters for Dice Masters). 

See? You&#039;d get what you want and you get a warm fuzzy feeling inside because you feel good for not making me feel bad... Or something like that. And I&#039;ll better stop rambling...

edit: reading comprehension. Yes, not one of my strengths. You already did, sorry for that :)
