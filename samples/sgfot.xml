[size=14][b][u]Game Ratings:[/u][/b][/size]
Over the past several months, it has become somewhat of a custom to give a brief set of ratings for any game that gets posted here, to give others an idea of what to expect.   It would be really great to see that continue!

Not sure what to do?    Just give a quick set of comments, as little as a single sentence each, telling us one thing that you like :thumbsup: about the game and two things that you dislike :thumbsdown::thumbsdown:.

Can&#039;t think of anything you dislike about the game?   Try to to come up with at least something that others might not like about it.   

Want to list more than just three things?   Go nuts!



:gg::gg:[size=14][b][u]The Monthly &quot;Challenge&quot; - Origin Stories[/u][/b][/size]
There have been a lot of great threads in the 1-Player Guild and particularly in the past month or so about what first brought players into solo gaming, how they got their starts in gaming, and even the sorts of things people look for in their solo games.  Building on that &quot;getting to know you&quot; theme, this time around...

[size=11][b][i]Tell us about your first time with the Solitaire Games On Your Table (SGOYT) lists.[/i][/b][/size]
What brought you here?  Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? 
What was the first game you posted?  Do you still own it and/or play it?
Was there anything else notable about your first visit?
Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?
What keeps bringing you back?
How much money have these lists cost you?
If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?

Make sure to label the item as &quot;[b]Origin Story[/b]&quot; or something equally obvious so they don&#039;t get missed!

Last month or before that there were a spreadsheet which showed which uses had posted gsmes during which month. If someone knows where that is, it should be easier to find your first entry to the SGOYT.
Maybe Kyle can link to it in the header if we find it?

Scroll to the top of the page, look for the &quot;add item&quot; button, below the header bumph.

My Origins story as a solo gamer are lost in the mists of time. But I did go to GenCon once (around 1978, if my calculations are correct; back when it was still held in Lake Geneva, WI).
I played solo Tunnels &amp; Trolls adventures/dungeons, games like Barbarian Prince, Mosby&#039;s Raiders, some of the magazine games from S &amp; T and Ares, and other solo games/gaming (like miniatures battles played solo).
Basically, I&#039;ve been playing solo in some form or another since the early 60s (from childhood games of make-believe, simple solo battles with Airfix plastic miniatures, to ever more sophisticated games with codified rules and more well-defined structure).

As an only child I&#039;ve had a lot of experience in solo gaming. :p As a studious kid who loved playing with his model soldiers and reading about history, wargaming was only around the corner.

And after buying various early games when I got the original slim version of Alexander&#039;s Greatest Battles the 1st in the GBoH series I was hooked.

First post on these lists seems to be in Oct. 2013 as far as I can tell!

Did the whole Fighting Fantasy, Tunnels and Trolls, Lone Wolf thing as well.

Edit: My change in Avatar is due to this - [thread=1306970]PBeM Waterloo Campaign.[/thread]
I&#039;m General Vandamme commanding the 3rd Corp.  The game is double blind with an umpire
the good - [user=hipshot][/user]
working out how long it takes orders to arrive from the various HQs and reports to travel back using these rules [thing=21915][/thing].  Basically no one apart from the umpire has a clear idea of where else is, even troops on your side.
It&#039;s going to be a lot of fun!

So, I have a confession to make.  There is a reason I only got in a few solo plays this last month even though I have new games for Christmas to play. 

I blame my brother-in-law.  He got me into Minecraft, of all things. (He&#039;s also to blame for getting me into MOBAs as well, as I originally had no interest in those either)  I played a trial of Minecraft a long time ago and just didn&#039;t &quot;get it&quot;. Didn&#039;t care, and I couldn&#039;t get past the graphics either. Over the holidays while over at his place, he sold me on it. I got it for PC, and found out the guild I play multiple games with, has a server so I joined, and was recommended a resource pack which I refuse to not use, cause it really really enhances the game. I&#039;ve been primarily playing that now, and having a freaking blast. I feel like I&#039;ve rekindled with legos again in a way. I have planned so many times to get a play in of Warfighter and I wind up just going into Minecraft and losing the day in it. UGH!!! I do have Darkest Night set up and I&#039;ve taken many turns with it, and I&#039;m doing it before adding in expansions to personally have that comparison and I&#039;m already seeing what you guys are talking about. I also have yet to get Warfighter to the table which is the one I was most excited about.

My wife thought it was neat but said it wasn&#039;t her type of game. Until of course we discovered Creativerse. (Currently in Beta)...  

I will try this month to have more discipline and get more solo board games in. I have goals I planned! (which was before Minecraft came around)

I can understand your Minecraft story - we got the kids Minecraft for christmas and of course I had to start my own survival world too.  I know if I start on it there will be no time for anything else so I do limit myself quite a bit (between that and BGG I&#039;d never get anything done! It also helps that I die quite a bit and lose absolutely everything I&#039;ve just gathered!!!  Ragequits a-go-go.).  The kids are a bit disappointed Mum wasn&#039;t even a fan of Creative mode!  We&#039;re just playing vanilla Minecraft, I&#039;ve said no mods until they&#039;ve defeated the Ender Dragon.  Firm but fair I like to think...

Yup. I have my own solo survival mode world, as well as a creative world that I made flat just to test out ideas before wasting resources in survival or on the multiplayer server I play on. I won&#039;t use mods either, with the exception of that resource pack since all it does is replace textures and doesn&#039;t effect the game. (bdcraft.net)

Btw, when you die, your stuff scatters about and you have about 5 minutes to get to it and collect it before it disappears.

[q=&quot;Ibbo&quot;]I can understand your Minecraft story...[/q]

My 7 year-old has become completely obsessed with Minecraft over the last couple of months. So much so, that my wife and I joke about making a drinking game out of it. Every time my son talks Minecraft (which is basically all that comes out of his mouth lately) we take a drink!

I tried playing the game many times throughout the years. I remember downloading some of the early alphas/betas and being really confused. It still hasn&#039;t clicked with me, but i&#039;m thinking I might have to start messing around with it again just so I can have conversations with my son.

Hello!

Well, I am currently successfully delaying downloading the most current version of what, as far as I know, is the original: [thing=70583][/thing]. But I do check the site daily, and it is unbelievable what Toady has already implemented and is currently adding.

I dread the moment there is a general consensus that all the tavern things are by and large bug free... (^_^;;

Oh....right....I guess I lose the internet today.  :shake:[/q]

I&#039;m sure you were so busy trying to decide what game you wanted that you missed the free shipping part. ;)

Having never dealt with Artscow before I went to look and am confused.

What gaming stuff do they have there?  I could&#039;t find anything game related.

Is it hidden somewhere on the site?

Let the record show my resolve to hold off on ordering new games this year faded on Friday, Feb 6th. :shake:

The lure of deep P500 discounts was too much... Silent Victory &amp; Liberty or Death look like they will fill out several categories I&#039;ve been itching for: Pacific Sub warfare (FC: Nimitz didn&#039;t give me enough sub action), COIN and the Revolutionary War.

SGOYT did not make me buy these specifically but I am pretty sure I wouldn&#039;t have known about Silent Victory if I didn&#039;t look into Hunters due to previous month&#039;s posts and I didn&#039;t even know about Liberty or Death until about an hour ago when I was looking at GMTs COIN page (due to my interest in COIN games sparked by this list).

So in a way this is all your fault. :devil:

I&#039;ve bought both Shadows of Brimstone base sets plus Progress so far this year but I&#039;m holding a morotorium on games purchasing now because I&#039;ve got many games unplayed and it&#039;s time to get real about playing expectations.

I should be getting my KS copy of Forge Wars next month, but I paid for that last year.

Space dictates that I start reducing my collection to a core that have reasonable expectations of getting played.

I had a feeling I might not see Liberty or Death until next year but it felt like Silent Victory was on the verge of going to print so I wanted to get that one in while it was still going for the P500 price.

Silent Victory has been in the cut for awhile and originally was supposed to release last fall. I&#039;m not quite sure what&#039;s holding it up.

Lots of stuff might hold it up.  If there are a lot of preorders, they might wait to send it to the printer when they aren&#039;t sending some other games, so they don&#039;t have 1.6 trillion games to mail out (it&#039;s a small staff).  It could be that they&#039;re waiting on final rulebook edits, or proofs from the production company.  

It&#039;s like a preorder before kickstarter.  They have an idea and a playtest copy (ok, some kickstarters might not even have that) generally, and GMT says they&#039;ll make it if enough people are interested.  but they still need to finish all the development work.

Though Silent Victory SHOULD be going to the printers soon, I feel.  So you&#039;ll probably see that one by the end of this year.  Maybe even the summer, depending on when they charge for it (they charge right before it goes to print).

It is in the art stage, but the artist had a few other games, so Silent Victory had to get in line. That is part of the holdup. As I understand artwork has begun, so I expect proofing to begin very soon. Then it is a matter of getting the game printed and 3 months time after that, voila. So in the fall is my guess.

Not a dumb question, I had to dig for a while. You need to go to forum settings, which are not easy to find. Here is a link:

I just changed mine as well. You know what surprises me, being the year of our lord 2015 and all, is that this website doesn&#039;t automagically set your time zone based on your location. I mean I would expect that from a something circa 2014 but come on guys this is the future!

That was the last game I played before he was born!  Typed up the session report from the notes while at the hospital :)

I tried playing my 3rd round when we got back, but it was a futile attempt.

I used to love Battletech so much in the 80&#039;s!  I spent a boatload of money on this game - buying all the expansions and technical readouts and source books and ....

I recall a mega campaign I setup which took me months to play through.  It started out in space with a dropship doing a blockade run on a planet, included a running battle over 3 boards stretched out lengthways and culminated in a 2 lance vs 2 lance mech combat (a fire lance and a recon lance each) in a city with tanks and infantry present as well.  

Even at the time, managing all the separate units in that final battle was overwhelming and not something I would have been looking to repeat.  Totally worth doing once though. :)

Every once in a while I stumble upon a computer game or app that gives me that old timey solitaire boardgame feel.

One such game is Darkest Dungeon, now on Steam for $19.99.  Quite unlike any computer game I&#039;ve played before, it has the real sense of a dungeon crawler with a persistent campaign mode.  You send a team of four adventurers on a quest each week, and when (if?) you return to town you spend your loot to upgrade town buildings and/or your adventurers&#039; skills and equipment.  The game is brutally tough, and it&#039;s expected that you will lose adventurers regularly; luckily the stagecoach brings in new recruits each week, ready to seek their fame and fortune.  The character types are varied and interesting, with very different abilities.  A key concept is stress: if it gets too high, your guys become useless and you have to send them to the abbey or tavern to recover.

Well worth taking a look, and if you do get it, I HIGHLY recommend you read this guide first: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385431020

I was actually going to post about Darkest Dungeon.

Playing it sort of reminds me of playing one of the Leader series games.  You manage a group of heroes who go on missions to explore various dungeons.  While they&#039;re on said missions they develop stress (from a scale of 0-100), and that affects their performance.  You can pick and outfit your team for your mission (which is always a mission of attrition).

it&#039;s a bit &quot;dark&quot; in terms of graphics (a bit bloody and whatnot), but I think it&#039;s done really well so far.  I&#039;m excited that there might be some time factor added into the game too.  Right now it seems I have as much time as I want, though I haven&#039;t progressed very far.

You bring up a good point - the game is still in Early Access.  But I ran across no bugs or other issues, other than the brutally tough game play and the lack of much explanatory documentation.  E.g., I just learned you can rename the characters.  Mayeb it&#039;s time for LaRue, Bittman, McKenzie and Grimley to venture forth...

Had not heard of Darkest Dungeon before. Potentially it might be right up my strasse. But there have been a lot of lightweight rogue-esque games on Steam and ios which have very little depth and I don&#039;t want another one of those.

Do tell more !

Actually Phil, if you go to the guide I linked in my above post, it should give you a sense of the game&#039;s depth.

I&#039;ve got a couple of hours of play logged in, and only three of my 12 chracters have even made it to level 2.  One of my only two healers left after I sent her to the abbey for rest and she became so inpired she went off on a pilgrimage.

I may restart using the tips that are in the guide.

There seems to be a lot of RNG in the game, but the sheer number of character traits that can develop is pretty deep.  The combat seems pretty deep as well.  Sort of like a Final Fantasy meets something were line position matters, as certain abilities can only be used when characters are standing in specific spots.  Also, you can level up abilities, or unlock other ones (I think) using what you find on your questing.  It really is a cool little game, and I think I&#039;ve already gotten my money&#039;s worth.  

I didn&#039;t read any guide and was confused for the first hour or so of gameplay, though.

Did you hear the Whoosh as RNG went straight over my head?

And I&#039;ve never been tempted to try a Final Fantasy game. Might &amp; Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic series&#039; and the Wizardry series were my preference. Morrowind was ok but a bit sprawly. I like the Dragon Age series and the Two Worlds series.

Ooh, I still love putzing around Wizardry 8.  The Avernum series is also really good!  I think it would be right up the alley of a lot of people who frequent this list.  The grid combat gives it a very tactical, boardgamey feel.  The world created in those games is captivating (dangerously so).  The second one was just remastered and is widely considered the best of the series!

The combat seems pretty deep as well.  Sort of like a Final Fantasy meets something were line position matters, as certain abilities can only be used when characters are standing in specific spots.  Also, you can level up abilities, or unlock other ones (I think) using what you find on your questing.  It really is a cool little game, and I think I&#039;ve already gotten my money&#039;s worth.  

I didn&#039;t read any guide and was confused for the first hour or so of gameplay, though.[/q]

Did you hear the Whoosh as RNG went straight over my head?

And I&#039;ve never been tempted to try a Final Fantasy game. Might &amp; Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic series&#039; and the Wizardry series were my preference. Morrowind was ok but a bit sprawly. I like the Dragon Age series.[/q]

Ooh, I still love putzing around Wizardry 8.  The Avernum series is also really good!  I think it would be right up the alley of a lot of people who frequent this list.  The world created in those games is captivating (dangerously so)[/q]

I think I started with Crusaders of the Dark Savant which I think was the 4th in the Wizardry series but ended up getting them all as far as Wizardry 8. Did a ninth one ever appear?

I started with Might &amp; Magic 3 but have all of them. Think I&#039;m close to finishing number 10. Have all the HOMM series too.

Never really enjoyed Baldur&#039;s Gate or it&#039;s sequels much, found them a bit dry. Avernum didn&#039;t hold my attention for the same reason, though I haven&#039;t checked out the latest version.

The Two worlds games are probably my favourites of the recent crop.

I understand.  I&#039;m not sure how much I&#039;d enjoy them if it weren&#039;t for the extreme nostalgia factor.  I started playing Avernum games when they were still called Exile and looked like this:

The Geneforge series by the same company moves along at a much quicker clip.  You might enjoy them!  (a nice thing about all of Spiderweb games is they come with huge free demos)

Avernum reminded me of the Magic Candle series I played in the eighties, nostalgic but a bit too retro for me.

The RPG that had the biggest Wow factor for me was Dungeon Master by FTL on the Atari ST. I still play the Java version ocasionally on my laptop for some nostalgia.

Wow, I hadn&#039;t thought of Magic Candle in years and years.  Very fond memories.

I just checked GoG.com and they don&#039;t have Magic Candle.  If you&#039;re not familiar with GoG, they update old PC games so they will work on modern versions of Windows.  The graphics are often improved, but not state of art, and the copies are legitimate, not pirated.

I&#039;ve recently played Master of Magic and Darklands with GoG-bought downloads.

Oh, I&#039;m on that train, Paul. Yeah, gonna be a great year, and I have both of those coming. 

I&#039;m more and more convinced the CoH AI is gonna knock the socks off. Speaking to Uwe about it (at the WBC) and hearing how excited he was to abandon the system they had ready to go because of how good this one was had me excited, and subsequent reports like that one just confirm it. EA: A is right up my alley for theme and the card-driven system. Just fantastic.

Now, I must get D-Day at Tarawa to the table before those arrive or else it&#039;ll get swallowed up. Taking rules with me to Florida to read by the pool!

Wha? Did you just say &quot;Master of Magic&quot;? Much time in the mid-90s was [-]wasted[/-] spent playing that masterpiece. I don&#039;t play video games much (if at all) anymore but MoM is one I still think about.

I hope you&#039;ve learned your lesson.

In a slightly more serious vein, the whole &#039;origin story&#039; plot line this month made me go back and revisit those long ago days of 2013-- Nov 2013 was -eight- pages long.  Jan 2015?  [b]TWENTY eight[/b] pages.

I find myself in a similar boat right now, though I&#039;m barely managing to keep up. Going back to only subscribing to entries and specific entries for comments has helped.

One of the problems with having a great list is that becomes difficult to find things again.

Somewhere in this months melange we were discussing Space operas and I bigged up Blake&#039;s 7.

I have just splashed out Â£31 with Amazon for the complete 4-season box set (17 discs), which apparently has, wait for it, 2600 mins of content (only 150 mins of which is extras).... WOW what a bargain, especially for a fan.

Lots of talk about Arts Cow in the comments (which made me make a GeekList). And then I saw this on Arts Cow news Section:

[b]Anticipated Production Delays due Chinese New Year[/b]
As Chinese New Year approaches, a majority of our production house team will be away on holiday from Feb 12 till Feb 27, 2015, which will lead to limited production capacity. In order to minimize the possibility of delays, we highly recommend you to place orders as soon as possible.

Operating times for our Customer Service department remains unchanged, please contact our team members if you have any questions or problems. 
[/q]

Makes sense why they have a Feb deal going on! ;)

Not a big deal to me, but if you want to see your order by March, butter get it in.... well, today. But it&#039;s probably too late now.

Looks like the Dutch release - all English language except for the menus. Would be interested in your thoughts about this after viewing. If all episodes are intact, this looks like much better value than the separate season box sets released in the UK.

Well, diving in Cozumel was simply amazing.

I missed gaming for the first couple of days, but it didn&#039;t take long to be engrossed in the land as well as the ocean. 

 A little over an hour and I/m all caught up on the new list, so very many new faces, nice to see. Set for a big weekend of solo and group gaming, but my mind and heart will keep drifting back to...

Glad you enjoyed your vacation.

from beautiful water to outer space: 

does anyone follow the kickstarter for Space Cadets - Away missions [thing=124827](bgg link)[/thing] ?
It seems to be an interesting space station crawler which might be more than just die rolls and alien killing that might be interesting to play solo.
For some reason the kickstarter seems to stall though. Any ideas why that might be?

I just beat the Star Realms App easy AI really bad.

I didn&#039;t realize how bad it was until I played the easy level just now.

213 to -123.

And I only ended the game because I finally got it so I could play my entire deck in one turn.  Though I think I left about 30 damage on the board with unused scrap effects.  When you play like 30 cards in one turn it&#039;s hard to keep track. :)

For me it was the cost, as it ends up being $130AUD after conversion and fees.

Also, there is just too much on Kickstarter ... and there is Ghostbusters, which is up to $450,000 (approx) in funding with 26 days.

Even with the contest here on BGG, which was posted 2.5 days ago, there hasn&#039;t been an increase in funding, it&#039;s just crawled along.

Also, I believe, there are a lot of games that are being sold as &quot;HUGE BOX WITH A LOT OF MINIS!!!!!!!!!!(and there&#039;s a game in there somewhere, too)&quot;

Honestly, people are getting tired of that, probably.  Our closets are getting filled with plastic and people are beginning to wonder if it&#039;s worth the expense.  I know I honestly gave up on kickstarter quite a while ago (well, firstly I was in on the Democracy kickstarter..so that didn&#039;t help), but every game my friend backed turned out to be just okay.  We played a few times, then it ended up on the shelf and we pulled out the tried and true games.  With all the added stuff that&#039;s getting attached to games because it can get big numbers by adding shineys, the closet space investment is too much for just &quot;okay.&quot;

I&#039;ll wait &#039;till it&#039;s out and see if it&#039;s any good, then buy it.  I&#039;m pretty sure paying extra for the Shadows of Brimstone expansions will make up for the money saved on all the mediocre kickstarters I DIDN&#039;T buy.

So far I haven&#039;t Kickstarted anything, I just wait for retail, and to see how the reaction is for the game from the community. I can&#039;t wait for the SoB expansions, trying desperately to save my pennies for when they finally emerge. Getting lots of value out of the one core box I own though.

I haven&#039;t kickstarted much, and it&#039;s mostly been stuff I know won&#039;t see a retail release and is cheap. Like The Agents. Or stuff I know needs my backing to get made, like Baseball Highlights. but I agree, most of the kickstarters are for games with gobs of minis in the hopes that gamers will jump onto them. 

In the past, thats been enough.  Zombicide has done it. 

But I think the frenzy is slowong down. Games are getting to be too much with too little actual examples of game play Ghostbusters doesn&#039;t have any good examples of play, and is way too expensive. Conan is just a bunch of plastic and costs like 180 bucks when shipping is included.

I have kickstarted too much and I&#039;ve been lucky. Most don&#039;t get on the table as much as I would like. I&#039;m more picky now.  The biggest disappointment was really one of my first backs -- [thing=126206][/thing] has great art but needed a bit of work.

But nothing with lots and lots of minis. Not my thing, I guess. I did read the Ghostbusters description and my thought was the same as others: &quot;Oh that sounds like Zombicide.&quot;

In other news -- I&#039;ll be out of touch for awhile. Vacation with the wife. My first month here has been fun.... talk to you in a few days!

What I really wish I&#039;d kickstarted was the bunch of miniatures NOT pretending to be a game: the Reaper BONES set.  SoB has wet my appetite for painting.

this sounds like an attitude i hope to be able to adopt soon...!:D
Sofar i actually enjoy buying games over kickstarter more than from the shelf - although youÂ´re surely right - would be better to just buy a good game in the first place or rather use the ones that are already bought - even better..

(but i guess thatÂ´s nothing new around here..!)

This is a really good question. Warfighter is one of the games I&#039;ve in my wishlist and I&#039;d like to know if I should remove it (or maybe give it a lower priority).

I just traded it away. The first few plays were good but then I lost interest.

However, maybe it just had &#039;new&#039; status in November.

On another note, I am just not keeping up with this month&#039;s list. I had to hit &#039;mark read&#039; on all the outstanding items (about 70 I think).

So many people having so much fun.  Keep it up people.

I got a serious case of the winter doldrums in December that led to my gaming enjoyment feel more like a hopeless chore than the incredible immersive experiences of prior. Warfighter was just one of many casualties. Recently i&#039;ve started feeling better so WF will be played. I&#039;ll let you know if it still holds up (I fully expect it to)

Maybe we&#039;re working through Christmas/sales pick-ups? Personally, I&#039;ve had several new things turn up, but I&#039;m still very sweet on Warfighter. 

I have a feeling I don&#039;t need many of the new expansions though - in the same way I don&#039;t buy different character skins for our horrifically monetised video games &quot;expansions&quot; these days. Might pick up a new conflict arena though (and I&#039;m still considering the mounted board).

One little tidbit for me-- everybody always goes on and on about &#039;the cult of the new,&#039; but DDaOB has more recent plays than DDay at Tarawa.  Last 4 months for DDaOB 2-4-1-4, for DDaT 1-1-2-1.  I&#039;m guessing that the installed base of gamers that owns DDaOB outweighs the newness factor of DDaT.

I&#039;m slowly making my way through the DDaT rules. I took the rulebook only with me on a brief getaway and read them by the pool. Thing is, I didn&#039;t have some of the other charts which meant I got hung up on the fire rules until I downloaded Koinskyz&#039;s PDF. But I spun my wheels for a good bit on that. Now that I&#039;m home, I&#039;ve been meaning to get back to them but have had a headache the past two days, presumably from weather shock, heh.

Point is, I -- like some others I see posting here -- are slowly making our way to Betio island.

This was the first item I ever posted to a SGOYT list, way back in 2013 on the very first SGOYT - before it was called SGOYT:  [listitem=2631358][/listitem]

The Robots were the main item, but it was actually a whole list of gaming goals for the month, most of which I did complete.   I still own and play every game listed there and several are still in heavy rotation, but of them Power Grid is the one that has seen the table the least since then.  As great as the Robots are for solo play, Power Grid remains a game that&#039;s best with other players.

What keeps me coming back is the gaming, and getting to see what others are doing with games that I enjoy.   I&#039;ve never tried to keep up on every item on every list, especially as they&#039;ve grown in size, but I still do keep an eye on certain games and certain other BGG users.

Speaking of certain other users, that&#039;s how I first found the list.  Every year when I&#039;ve done the big BGG Secret Santa, I&#039;ve made it a point to subscribe to my target to see what kinds of things they&#039;re doing on the site.  Honestly, some of them have been pretty boring and were barely active on the site at all, at least in areas that would set off subscription notices.   However, one was different, and would frequently post all sorts of interesting things, including on that solitaire gaming list.  Once there, the list itself looked pretty neat so I jumped in and have never left.  

Just who was that mystery user?   [b]That will remain a mystery.[/b] :p 


ADDED:   So far these lists haven&#039;t cost me much money, aside from paper, printer ink, and time spent cutting and laminating.   I&#039;ve tried out quite a few great PNP games since starting here, but so far have somehow resisted purchasing any new games based off what gets posted here.  However, quite a few games have been added to my wishlist...</body>

Well, you narrowed the field down for us at least.  :whistle:


I&#039;ve told my Origin Story before, but I&#039;ll drop into the list at some point this month.


And you&#039;re directly responsible, Kyle, for one or two of my purchases.


I like the &quot;Challenge&quot; this month.  Looking forward to the stories.

	<body>I recently acquired both [thing=144777]Heart of Glorm[/thing] and [thing=159458]Downwood Tales[/thing], so I&#039;ve been playing through those over the past few weeks.     Here&#039;s my ongoing list item where I&#039;ll be recording the play-through of each chapter.


:thumbsup:   Gorgeous artwork and exceptional components
:thumbsup:   Great story-driven narrative that pulls you into the game and makes you really care about what happens to the characters.

:thumbsdown:  Combat is fairly simplistic, with a lot of dice-rolling.
:thumbsdown:  If you [i]don&#039;t[/i] get into the story aspect of the game, it could quickly seem repetitive and unexciting.  [i](Although honestly, if you weren&#039;t going to at least attempt to enjoy the great story this game provides, I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d even bother with it in the first place.)[/i]




[COLOR=#FF0000][size=12]Below this point will be [b]spoilers[/b] for both expansions[/size][/COLOR], so read with caution if you haven&#039;t played through them but think you might.

[i](Not used this chapter)
Lily - Exploding Shot, Preemptive Shot - Badger Gloves[/i]

Maginos was required for this chapter, so Lily sat out.


A lurker grabbed Maginos moments after the mice began in the Sewers, but he was able to break free and with help from Nere picked it apart with magic.  Filch quickly took out a pair of roaches while Collin worked on a third, but with some difficulty because it took a big bite out of him before he chopped it apart.   Three more caustic roaches surged as they were crossing the water, but all were disposed of before they could cause any damage.  Meeps even managed to get one of them.

They went to the (blocked) Tunnel Entrance and found it crawling with roaches, but they were no match for Filch who raced ahead and cut through them effortlessly, gaining himself the Roachmaster achievement in the process (that&#039;s 3 chapters in a row!) and buying the team some valuable time.   Maginos found a nice bow that he tossed to Filch, then they were on to the Sewer Drain Pipe...

Another lurker attacked as soon as they entered the area, but Filch shrugged off the attack and sprinted over top of the drain pipe to pull the pack rat peddler out of the water before he was swept away.  It bought the team even more time, but none of the items the peddler offered were worth buying.
Nere sliced off several of the lurker&#039;s legs with her Mystic Blade, then Collin put it out of its misery with his own sword.  While waiting for the others to make their way around, Filch found a grape and Nere found a nice Needle Rapier, which she handed off to Collin as soon as he caught up.

Without a tinkerer in the group they couldn&#039;t head up into the Pipes, so they went through the Crystal Tunnels instead, and met up a whole pack of skulker rats.  Maginos disintegrated one with a mystic bolt as it approached, then Nere charged and decapitated another with her blade.  Collin and Filch moved in to go for the remaining two, but they managed to block the attacks and then struck back.  Collin took a hit, then Filch blocked and tore one apart with his bone knife, but they&#039;d made too much noise and attracted unwanted attention.  Skorch!  Filch ran out to head it off while Nere went for the last skulker.  She missed, but while it was distracted Meeps(!) bit it in the neck to put it down.  Rather than attempt to fight off Skorch in the tight confines of the tunnels, they all scrambled up the ladder to the Alchemist&#039;s Chamber.  

They came face-to-face with a trio of skulkers, but the real danger was Skorch who had followed them up.   The skulkers dropped quickly thanks to Filch and Collin, but Skorch set Maginos on fire so he had to fall back until the others could help out.  They chipped away at Skorch, but it managed to set Collin on fire too before Nere swept in and hacked it to pieces (5 damage hit!) with her trusty blade once again.

Safe for the time being, they all took turns searching as Maginos and Meep climbed up on the table to find a window.   A Lore Rune was found, which was used by Nere to gain Strangle Vines.

Meeps flew out the window, and another chapter ended in a success!

Lily - Exploding Shot, Preemptive Shot - Badger Gloves
Nez - Thundersqueak

[i](Not used this chapter)
Nere - Bark Fur, Summon Pet Slug, Strangle Vines - Mystic Blade
Maginos - Mystic Bolt - Lucky Skullcap[/i]


Nez was required for this chapter and Nere was required to remain behind, so that was an easy swap.  Lily hopped back into her spot that Maginos had occupied in the previous chapter.  (Setup didn&#039;t specifically restrict him, but the story text had him staying behind too.) 


The group was ambushed by skulkers and caustic roaches as soon as they began.   The rats were cut down before they could cause any harm, but there wasn&#039;t enough to time stop all of the roaches and three of the mice ended up wounded before the area was cleared.   Then they headed down into the Crystal Tunnels...

Grape Trap!   What a cool thematic twist to the game, and a pretty nasty obstacle too!  Stuff like this is what really makes the game shine.

Lily fired off a pair of shots the moment she hit the ground.  The preemptive shot sailed wide, but she followed it up with an exploding arrow that took out the pair of roaches waiting on the far side of the room.  The third tried to take a bite out of her leg, but Collin chopped it in half.   Then they had to deal with the trap.  Filch was completely unconcerned and raced ahead, while Lily and Collin could take their time and wait for the right moment, but big ol&#039; lumbering Nez was in for a world of hurt unless they could find another way through.  Filch found a leather breastplate that he handed to Nez, but then Lily found a Mystic Tome that would have been an amazing treasure if Maginos or Nere was along for the ride - they could have pulled a teleport scroll and jumped straight to the other end.  Instead, Collin used it for a Heal All scroll that was going to come in handy after Nez took a pounding from the grapes.   Collin and Nez continued searching while waiting for a gap between the grapes, but instead of finding something useful Collin found a [color=red]Mind Worm[/color].  Fortunately Nez was on him immediately to give a gentle tap on the head with his hammer.

When they found a gap, Filch ran ahead and took out a roach, while Lily quickly followed and killed a second one.  Collin was right behind her and stabbed the lurker spider that had scurried after Filch but couldn&#039;t quite reach him.  Collin and Lily prepared for the imminent attack, but it never came as a timely grape rolled through and crushed it into a gooey mess right before their eyes.  They didn&#039;t have time to relax, though, as a pair of skulkers arrived.  Lily blocked the first&#039;s attack and then tore it apart with her badger gloves.  The second took a swing at Filch and missed, then Collin and Filch used the trick of linking their tails to trip it up.   The immediate dangers passed, they spent some time searching before they found enough of a gap between the grapes to make it to the stairs to escape.  Even Nez managed to slip through without getting hit.

[floatright][imageid=2401322][size=8][i]Nez finds a nail for his hammer.[/i][/size][/floatright]Into the Kitchen and another cool thematic area, sneak-attacking zombies!  Nez and Filch teamed up to take out one that was right next to the exit tile.  Lily took a shot at one and missed, so instead of knocking one of the others over Collin did a quick search instead.  They held their breaths as the zombies wandered some more, then Nez smacked another to knock it down while Filch dropped another single-handedly with a tail sweep followed up immediately by his dagger.   Lily put an arrow through the one Nez had knocked over, but in its dying moments it let out a screech that raised the alarm, alerting the three on the table.  Collin scrambled up the broom handle to head them off and knocked down one that stayed down.  The other two started swinging, but neither could find their target.   Nez and Filch climbed up the broom handle to help and knocked down one each, which Collin followed up with a swing to make sure another stayed down.  Nez smashed the remaining one with his hammer and Collin again finished it off, then they took a breather for a turn to patch up their wounds before heading into the Queen&#039;s Chamber.   Filch found a Ring of Cat Strength that he hoped would serve him well in the battles ahead.

Fighting against the blaring music, Lily sent and explosive arrow into the swarm of roaches and blasted three at once, then Filch sprinted to the mortar and dropped its operator before it had the chance to fire.   Nez and Collin headed toward the vanity to destroy the music box, as Lily picked off another roach to claim the Roachmaster achievement.  Filch joined the other two to hammer away at the music box, while Lily did a great job picking off any new roaches that appeared.  A few turns later it was over, the room fell silent, and another chapter had been completed successfully.

Collin - Encourage, First Aid, Backslash - Needle Rapier
Filch - Energy Rush, Tail Sweep - Ring of Cat Strength
Lily - Exploding Shot, Preemptive Shot - Badger Gloves
Nez - Thundersqueak - Leather Breastplate
Nere - Bark Fur, Summon Pet Slug, Strangle Vines - Mystic Blade
Maginos - Mystic Bolt - Lucky Skullcap

All six got to take part in this chapter.  Nere and Maginos began in the Alchemist&#039;s Chamber where they spent the previous chapter, while Collin, Filch, Lily, and Nez had to work their way back from the Queen&#039;s Chamber.

Skulkers attacked both groups right away.  One managed to badly wound Nere, but she used the pain to her advantage and disintegrated it with her ginger root wand.   Then the two got to work gathering the ingredients needed for the Heartworm potion.  The other four had a much larger pack of skulkers to deal with, and Lily took a big hit, but it didn&#039;t take them long to clear out the room.   Lily did a quick search and found some throwing daggers that she gave to Collin in exchange for patching up her wounds, while Nez used the tinkerer&#039;s treasure he found in the clock to construct her a powerful new enchanted bow.

Their next stop was the Kitchen, where they met an old friend...  Brodie.  Necro-Brodie. Collin and Nez went out ahead to attack, but Brodie was quicker and swallowed Nez.  Lily to the rescue!   On her very first shot with her brand new bow she rolled three hits, earning the [b]Marksman[/b] achievement and freeing Nez.  In the blink of an eye she followed that up with a second shot [i](using the token she&#039;d just acquired)[/i] to knock out the beast.  They didn&#039;t know how much time they&#039;d have before it got back up again, so they quickly swept the room and headed down into the Dining Tunnels.

Meanwhile, back in the Alchemist&#039;s Chamber, Nere and Maginos had collected the last of the ingredients and Nere started mixing.   Some of Lily&#039;s luck on the other end of the board found its way to Nere, as the attempt was successful on the first try!

A trio of mindless rats were waiting in the Dining Tunnels, but they never stood a chance.   Nez dropped two in one mighty thundersqueak, then Collin swept in right behind him and made sure they stayed down with a quick swing and a backslash.   Lily double-tapped the third with her enchanted bow, then they all took a moment to make a search (Collin found a grape) before entering the Kitchen Tunnels, which they cleared just as quickly.

Yet another skulker went after Nere and Maginos, but they were able to fend it off from a distance.   Nere missed with her first attack, but finally rolled their first cheese which she handed that off to Maginos.  He sent out a mystic bolt that took out the Skulker and turned it into an explosion of cheese, making him the [b]Cheesemaster[/b] and leaving them well-prepared for whatever came next.

The Kitchen was swarming with roaches, but each did their part and cut through mess.  Collin, Nez, and Lily picked off the roaches, while Filch scurried up onto the table and effortlessly dispatched the mindless rat operating the mortar with his trademark tail sweep and dagger combo.  They burst back into the Alchemit&#039;s Chamber just in time to see Maginos disintegrate another skulker with a mystic bolt.   Reunited, and another chapter successful!

[i](Not used this chapter)

Only five could go along in this chapter, so Nez sat out.


[floatleft][imageid=2407727][size=8][i]Full setup, early on.[/i][/size][/floatleft]They cleared the Crystal Tunnels quickly and without incident, although a few lucky rolls by the last few rats to be defeated filled up most of the cheese wheel.  It was early and there was no immediate threat, so they all took a little time to search; Nere pulled a Determination card, which gave everyone a nice cheese boost moments later when the empty surge was triggered at the end of the round.

They moved on to the Kitchen Tunnels, where Lily immediately picked off a roach at long range.   The others ran out to take care of the rest and cut through the mindless rats quickly, although Filch got a face full of poison from a caustic roach.   Nere tried out her new Voodoo Doll, and used one roach to take out another, while Collin found the Fickle Amulet he&#039;d lost several chapters earlier.

They then climbed up into the Kitchen where they found themselves surrounded with greedy roaches that grabbed a few pieces of cheese, but then they started striking back.  Lily sent out an explosive arrow took out two at once, but that drew the attention of a centipede so instead of taking out the rest of the roaches they turned their focus to that.  Maginos and Filch each took a chunk out of it, then Collin charged out and sliced it in half with a mighty swing, plus he caught a nearby roach with the backswing.  Lily shot a fourth roach to claim [b]Roachmaster[/b] (making the remaining roaches less greedy), then Filch cleared out the last survivor.

They checked out the Dining room next where they were ambushed by Skulkers.  Lily fired off preemptive shot, but instead of scoring a hit she gained the [b]Cheesemaster[/b] achievement.   Lily and Nere both took big hits from the Skulkers, but they all struck back in turn to get rid of them.

On the way through the Dining tunnels, after facing a swarm of roaches, a frenzied crawler appeared but Lily almost single-handedly took it out with her enchanted bow (three hits in two shots).  Collin took a swing to finish it off, then they were on to the King&#039;s Tunnels.

Another swarm of roaches appeared, but they posed little threat, and then they entered the King&#039;s Chamber for the final showdown.  Skulkers were waiting for them as soon as they entered the room, and Lily took another hit.   Lily fired back to take out one of them, then Filch cut his way through to take out two more.  

[floatright][imageid=2407729][size=8][i]The final showdown.[/i][/size][/floatright]It was time to deal with Glorm.  Collin ran to meet him head on, while the others started lobbing shots at him.   Lily scored a hit, but then Glorm summoned Skorch.  Lily fired a few shots to chip away at Skorch, then Collin moved in to finish it off and even took a swing at Glorm but missed.  The group had Glorm pinned down and took turns wearing down his defenses while Nere called upon her slug buddies who moved into position.

Lily nocked the Arrow of Truth, let it fly, and it was over...

I have to give a special shout-out for game design -  Even though this is primary meant as a cooperative game, in Chapter 5 of [thing=144777]Heart of Glorm[/thing] there&#039;s an entire section that&#039;s written specifically for people playing this solo.  It&#039;s very cool that they took that into account, and better yet it&#039;s handled in a way that makes it difficult to cheat even if you play the chapter more than once.

	<body>Just setting [thing=111799][/thing] up on my table and will be playing it past midnight, so this will be for February.  After playing a face to face game today of [thing=144189][/thing] I am really anxious to pull out another COIN game and play it solo tonight.  I plan on trying out the Syndicate and botting the other players and seeing how it goes.

[COLOR=#FF0000]EDIT:[/COLOR] I did win as Syndicate.  The designer claimed to me, in person, that he thought all of the bots were pretty well balanced and that technically the game could be played by itself with all sides being botted (the rules specify solo games for just 26 July or Government).  Solo games, however, allow the Syndicate to last in a game, which is key to them winning. 

Anyways, back to the IMPORTANT STUFF:

I have a feeling, however, that COIN will take a back seat by Wednesday when [b][thing=39941][/thing][/b] is due to arrive by Fed Ex from Coolstuffinc.  This game, following the life of a simple grognard in the French Army during the Napoleonic years has some intriguing possibilities as a solo game.  It seems like a little part RPG, a little part of a narrative game like [thing=113873][/thing] as far as some random elements to it, and some room for decision making as well.  I will be updating my entry after playing it with some more thoughts on it.</body>

I&#039;m really interested in your thoughts on Legion of Honor.

A few other people have played it, and it&#039;s gotten some positive press (from SGoyT).  I think the theme is cool, but I&#039;m not sure if the game has a place in my collection or not.

Legion of Honor is definitely eye candy and the designers have put a lot of love into it, but the videos I have seen and what I have heard from solo play throughs of this from a friend, the play looks bland and boring.

I am worried about that, Gordon.  Still, I want to give it a chance.  It reminds me of a lot of an old PBEM game called En Garde!  Very much about making a few decisions and having everything play out in a similar French setting with military glory and the ladies and trying to ease your way into the nobility.

[q=&quot;kixdsky&quot;] It reminds me of a lot of an old PBEM game called En Garde!   [/q]

You know, I just found out about this game, and in doing some research on it, I too, was reminded of [thing=7771][/thing] (which was a rules book published by GDW in 1975, long before PBeM was a gleam in anybody&#039;s eye-- En Garde was meant to be played ftf).

Anyhow, this looks very interesting, and after reading [thread=1302411][/thread], bland and boring would be the LAST words I&#039;d use to describe it.  As always, YMMV.

Also interested to hear what you think of this. I&#039;ve just received this on order as the theme seemed very interesting. A perusal of the rules so far also reminds me of EnGarde which I used to play back on the 80&#039;s.

It was February, 2014... I wasn&#039;t happy at work or at home, and I was still amazed by my most recent BGG.CON, years after my previous one back when it was still hosted at the Westin. 

I picked this game up at BGG.CON, had it signed by the designer, and loved it, even though after BGG.CON I could find zero people who wanted to play it. 

So I started digging into the BattleQuest logs, and have loved it ever since.  I still have warm fuzzies from that BGG.CON whenever I play this game. 

[b]Continued because I left out the rest of this story goodness[/b] 

I had lurked before, I think, I don&#039;t remember when I found out about SGOYT. It was probably because the GeekList showed up on the front page and I just watched it, wondering. 

And then I just quietly delurked and that seemed to be the end of it. :) 

I hang out here because it&#039;s such a nice community. And I am content. </body>

There is a copy of this at my FLGS that has a dinged box, so it is on sale for a decent price. Is it worth it for solo play?

Oh, I&#039;d play it with you. Seems like a game you could probably get the girlfriend to do with you as well.

BattleQuest is quite alright solo, and I love it that way. There are three solo dungeons (two are called tag team dungeons, but they&#039;re really solo dungeons). The first is challenging as long as you don&#039;t use the Legendary Weapon with the Cannon base, and the other two are just plain challenging. You can add extra equipment that allows for play you would not get normally in the normal game. 

(Although this equipment can be used, on agreement, in the multiplayer game.)

If you have opponents as well, the value goes up dramatically. Even if you don&#039;t have opponents for the normal game, there is a BattleCon AI that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac (with a little tweak for the Mac). 

[thread=1138204][/thread]

It is an excellent opponent. 

Without at least a second player, the bosses are unusable thus far since no one has developed an AI for them. 

As for game play, it highly depends on if you like fighting games, which this emulates very well and elegantly so. If you always liked the idea of them, but didn&#039;t have the reflexes for the video game ones (like me), then this is a great buy. 

Conclusion: 

- If you really like the concept, maybe buy this game if you don&#039;t mind a computer AI and BattleQuest. 
- If you have an opponent as well, totally buy this game. 

BattleCon (as this is part of the BattleCon family) is entertaining and easy to get into, because game play is so simple and yet so deep. There are different tiers of fighters from the easy to the more complex, and moving your way up the tiers is fascinating. Even just playing all the fighters in the single tier is wonderful as well.

	<body>Playing through the scenarios in this expansion, which I just recently got.

Just finished Sacile, which the French won (which apparently is very uncommon, according to ccnapoleonics.net&#039;s statistics), and Teugen-Hausen, which was a complete blowout by the Austrians. The Grenzers just stood in the woods and rifled down the helpless French right wing.</body>

I just got this in, not looking forward to stickering it, but I&#039;m excited about playing the expansions, though I need to play the base game a bit more too.

Such a good system that I&#039;m sorry I overlooked for so long!

I have the Battlelore app and it hasn&#039;t grabbed my attention that much.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because it&#039;s digital, or I prefer the cleaner art of these.  I know the Battlelore games add some cool unit abilities, so that might be fun.  M44 is fun, but a bit too simple for me to buy into all the expansions, but the core game is great.  Played the first scenario twice and won it as both sides, and it&#039;s played completely differently each time.

M&#039;44 (and all C&amp;C games) definitely don&#039;t lack in replayability. 

The BL game is much better than the app. First of all, it has hills (units no longer block LoS). 2nd of all, it has the normal command cards you draw, not the (innovative) tableau that only gets refreshed by ordering one unit.  

If pre-game army building and the unique scenario setup of BL2E do nothing for you, then stick with what you&#039;ve got (particularly Nappy). For me, especially the army building (and the possibilities when combined with the imminent expansions), I have a hard time keeping drool in my mouth. 

In BL2E, you are able to deploy a terrain tile called a command tent. This tent gives you 5 more mustering points but it&#039;s also on the board and, amongst a few limitations, if the enemy occupies it they get 2 VPs. In my last game, I noticed that the Reverend had his unit placement at his left flank only on the hex row closest to him. This allowed me to place my command tent on my right flank, far from his units and it allowed me to place one or two more units down. Just one small example of the choices given to the player.

Finally, it&#039;s really difficult to learn the units&#039; special abilities through playing the app. When you play the boardgame, it all becomes clear and you really see how to parry and thrust. Unless you enjoy sitting and clicking through the help text in the app.....

Units don&#039;t block LOS? I thought we determined that they did.

I love the idea of the pregame army building and variable scenarios (though I think there are fewer combos than what&#039;s in the nappy core set (15 or 20, plus 20 in each expansion).

But I think the army building makes them even more replayable. 

I just don&#039;t know if I wanna send money on it. I need to sell off a lot of games I have but don&#039;t play, to make room on my shelf. Maybe if someone wants to trade? It doesn&#039;t have to be even.

There are 7 scenarios per side, so 49 possible combinations in the core game. The army packs about to be released offer 3 more for each side (100 possible combinations). 

I do think 20 in Napoleonics is plenty!

When playing Battlelore, though, one negative for solitaire play might be the Lore cards. They are excellent ways for entrapping your enemy, setting up some bait to get your enemy to move towards a certain location and ZAP. It&#039;s great!

Napoleonics has more of a parallel to Chess in terms of the bluffing and maneuvering, more subtle. 

Still, I think it&#039;s worth it :D

For Napoleonics, I do the &quot;play one card randomly for each side, and figure out the best thing to do with that card&quot; system of playing it solitaire. That works great for me.

The only caveat is that if sides have different hand sizes (Command), then the side with more cards will get to choose which of two cards to play, when both sides are about to redraw. So if the Austrians have 4 cards, and the French have 5, it goes like:
1. France 1st card                         1. Austrian 1st card
2. France 2nd card                         2. Austrian 2nd card
3. France 3rd card                         3. Austrian 3rd card
4. France chooses from 4th or 5th card     4. Austrian 4th card

This is different than how I like to solo C&amp;C Ancients, where I will do the normal &quot;look at the whole hand and plan out my plays for both sides separately.&quot; I just found that Napoleonics was too involved to make it enjoyable playing that way. The tactics in Ancients seem a lot more straightforward. Although now I&#039;m getting the hang of Napoleonics more, so maybe it&#039;s not so bad.

	<body>So it&#039;s Feb here in Florida, so I&#039;m posting this here.

Decided to try this game tonight, finally (well, I got it in the mail on Friday, so it&#039;s not really that long).  Set it up and played one best of 7 and got creamed by the &quot;AI&quot; (it&#039;s in quotes, because it&#039;s not really an AI at all).  Learned I was doing some things wrong (batters only hit what their card says regardless of what speed they are, so I was giving a one base advantage to the fast batters, and the AI deck had lots of those), so I decided to set it up again.

The game solos quite fast (a best of 3 took me about 25-30 minutes), and is actually pretty cool.  But I think it&#039;s the game mechanics that I think are really cool more than anything.

It&#039;s a baseball game in theme, but mechanically it&#039;s quite a bit abstracted.  You don&#039;t go through innings, but there are ways to play &quot;double play&quot; cards and your batters will hit singles, doubles, triples, or homers.

It&#039;s actually a bit of hand management coupled with trying to trump what your opponent is playing, a bit of bluffing with your &quot;on deck&quot; card (a card that gets set aside at the start of a contest that you can pinch hit in, or try to use to save the game at the end... and the more I think about that rule, the more thematic it is.....).

The solo game is played in a best of series against an AI deck.  This game is unlike other &quot;deckbuilders&quot; in a way.  On one hand, you&#039;re not trying to cycle through your deck really quickly, but on the other, you are trying to recruit new players between matches to improve your team (players are cards, that are displayed in a 6 card offer).  At the start of the game, you deal the AI 15 random cards from the buy deck (so it starts with a stacked team compared to yours), but this advantage is offset because the AI player plays every card randomly, so there&#039;s not a lot of strategy to its plays.  Sometimes it will play a card that&#039;s useless to its current situation, and other times it will play the card it needs to FOIL your plans.  Interestingly enough, the AI deck never changes, so you can sort of build yours to counter it.

During a round, one player plays a card and resolves its &quot;immediate&quot; effect.  This might be to remove 2 of your opponents base runners, or get an extra hit if you&#039;re behind (or have runners on second), or cancel hits your opponent is threatening.  Then your opponent resolves his/her threatened hits.  Then you place yours.

The pacing is a bit odd, but I think it&#039;d be quicker and less awkward if I wasn&#039;t resolving 2 boards at a time.

Each mini-game (think individual game in the best of series) is 6 rounds, with the home team getting the last card played (the visitor can attempt to &quot;save&quot; by either playing their on deck card, or blindly drawing from the top of their deck in an attempt to cancel whatever hits are played on the home team&#039;s last card played... this was NOT CLEAR in the rules at all), and the player with more runs scored than his/her opponent wins the game.

The player then gets to buy new players using the money icons on the 6 cards they played), which go on top of the deck (so they&#039;re used the next game).  They then have to send a number of cards to the &quot;minors&quot; (read: remove from the game) equal to the number of cards they bought, so their deck is always 15 cards (card scrapping built in?  cool!).  Then you draw 6 more cards and are ready to go again for a second game in your best of series.

The rulebook is short, and some of it isn&#039;t all that clear, but I found answers to my questions in various places on the game&#039;s page here (need to start an errata/clarification thread I think), so my second game went a lot smoother.

First game, BO/7, and I lost horribly.  4 games to 1.  But I was playing some runners wrong, so it gave an advantage to the AI (they had a lot of fast runners, and I was giving them free bases when I didn&#039;t need to).

Second game, BO/3, and I got lucky enough to take it in 3 (won 2/1).

The game plays fast, is decently light, but is fun.

As a solo deckbuilder, I think I like it more than Star Realms (which is a fantastic multiplayer game, but the solo game got a bit boring for me).  There&#039;s a ton of variability between games in what cards the AI has, what&#039;s available for me to buy (there&#039;s a 60 card buy deck, but in both of my games, I only saw like 12 cards of it).  Each of the four starting decks also has a bit of asynchronous abilities in the deck (didn&#039;t look at them too closely, but there are differences), which I think is pretty darn cool in any deck builder, and it&#039;ll keep the multiplayer game from getting stale during the early rounds.  

Based on these two quick plays here are my thoughts:
:thumbsup:  Solo game seems to offer some cool choices, and the game is light enough for me to want to play two in a row
:thumbsup:  The baseball theme is a winner for me (it&#039;s the reason I backed it on Kickstarter... well that and a promised solo variant in the rules).
:thumbsdown: Rulebook is kind of meh.
:thumbsdown: The box is about 50% bigger than it needed to be.  I know there will be some expansions for the game (got 2 with the kickstarter, and I ordered the 3 that I didn&#039;t buy, for whatever reason), but those are kind of small.  It could have done with a box the size of Run, Fight, or Die, or Lagoon, but it&#039;s in something that has about the same area as a slightly skinnier COIN box!  Way too big for 120 cards, some pawns, and 3 smallish boards.</body>

Agreed on pretty much everything. Initially, I thought the rules were pretty good, but a perusal of the forums showed me quite a bit of stuff I was mistaken on.

Hmmmm.... Baseball has absolutely zero interest for me, and as I&#039;m theme-driven I don&#039;t suppose this one has much potential for me. But I do wonder whether to try it as an experiment in gaming, can the game capture my attention even though I would never watch an actual game?

BTW, I keep seeing COIN mentioned so it&#039;s about time I asked what that stands for?

No, actually Labyrinth is not.  The COIN games have a certain mechanic with the cards that is much different than other games.  With Labyrinth you hold a hand of cards and decide when to play.  With COIN you play the cards 1 up and 1 future card and decide on which card you want to play - do you use the card power, or use the card for an Operation (which there are several things you can do).

IMO, both hold a place in a collection (and each COIN game plays slightly different even though they are based on the same mechanics).  That said, the only one out of the series I didn&#039;t care for was A Distant Plain - and prefer to play Labyrinth over that game.  I know most people recommend starting with Cuba Libre, but I actually prefer Andean Abyss for introducing people - it&#039;s more forgiving than Cuba Libre which is a very tight game.

Glad to hear you are enjoying [b]Baseball Highlights 2045[/b]!

To answer one question, the box had to be big enough to hold the cards in slots and also had to be big enough to hold the 4 Player Stadium Mats, so there was not that much choice in size.

Instead of wasting all that space, we designed the insert to make sure you could sleeve all your cards without a problem. In addition, because we think [b]Baseball Highlights 2045[/b] will be a great tournament game, we made enough room in the insert to make sure you can fit in two sets of cards, wood pawns and other bits and still have room for expansions for both.

In essence you can easily combine two games of [b]Baseball Highlights 2045[/b] into one box with all of the cards sleeved for easy transport. That&#039;s enough for up to eight people to all play in a tournament format.

Or, given the forum here, enough for eight of you to get together and play solitaire! :devil:

We have been getting some great feedback about how much fun the game is even if you are not that interested in baseball. As an example, we recently published [b]Rococo[/b], which is about dress making. Since it is a great game, I haven&#039;t read about anyone not liking it because it is about a fancy dress ball where you are trying to make dresses. [b]Baseball Highlights 2045[/b] is fun because it works well as a game.

Thanks for your comments!

I understand your comments about box size.  I know most places only have 1 or 2 sizes to choose from when putting games together, and it&#039;s really not a big complaint.

I don&#039;t sleeve, but the fact that you guys took advantage of the size you had and made it so it&#039;ll fit sleeves cards is a big plus!  Thinking of the customers.

Really am glad I kickstarted it.  In fact, after playing a few times I nabbed the expansions I hadn&#039;t purchased through the kickstarter through the website.  Just so I could have more cards!

Fun game; I got to try it at a convention last year. I just wasn&#039;t sure when it would get played as I don&#039;t do much 2P gaming, and I wasn&#039;t soloing at the time. Think I convinced a friend to pick it up though; need to go check on [-]my schemes[/-] that.

One thing that helps me get past the yellow stage: make sure you get at least a 3 and a 4 value card into your deck before you start the yellow round. When I started doing this, I started winning games consistently.

Yes - a common mistake is to go after the low point cards in the green phase.  The high point cards give you the chance to either dump a lot of zero/-1 cards or get the high value cards into your hand.

I had this revelation the last time I played the game (which was the first time i had played it in like 2 years) and the game went MUCH more smoothly.  I took like 5 damage of HP one turn, but was able to ditch out a TON of bad cards, which left my deck thinish and full of good cards.  It&#039;s really a good strategic point.

Both of the points made above make a HUGE difference. Taking the hit early on(without going overboard) against the bigger cards really helps get the junk out.

You can almost, but not quite, play on auto-pilot for the green and yellow rounds by (a) always fighting against the higher draw card; (b) unless it is only the lower draw card that has the Destroy ability; (c) remembering to use your powers like Copy (and One Below the Pile) on +Life cards, and the ability to see and select the top three cards of the Robinson deck; and (d) using (almost) every opportunity to get rid of ageing cards. Your life points will dwindle spectacularly very quickly, but you should slowly build back up again for facing the red round, and it is surprising how, for most Pirates, only a few live points are necessary.

But I&#039;ve only managed to beat Level 3 twice, so take my advice with a cup of seawater :p

You have to pace yourself in the green round, you want to lose fights so you can cull out the garbage but you need to win some also or you end up to weak.
In yellow, do the same but you go for more wins, getting the phase card in yellow is very powerful.
Once in red I go for as many wins as possible.
And of course, if an aging card is out you want to lose that fight. 


It&#039;s a strange little dance but that&#039;s what makes it so fun. :)

	<body>I literally checked for victory, turned and looked at the clock and it was 12:00, so I suppose this game happened in February. :what:

I feel like it&#039;s been forever since I played this, though it was just November I think. I did pull of a win on the easier 1-player card which I think means I&#039;ve won it 2 or 3 times so I may go ahead and bump it up.

The win did not come easy. Had I not been able to purchase the last support token by grabbing a card in the abolitionist offer on the last turn, I was probably doomed. I played as the conductor, gaining an extra couple movement most of the game which is invaluable. For some reason, tonight&#039;s play really showed me that this game is all about the maneuvering of your slaves through the ever pressing gauntlet of slave catchers. Some of you are probably thinking, &quot;no duh moron... it&#039;s the Underground Railroad,&quot; and you&#039;re right to do so. I knew this before, but something about tonight&#039;s game just really sucked me in and showed me just how difficult the job was and how clever the UG participants had to be to dodge the potential captors. Awesome game. If you&#039;ve never experienced it, you need to try.

:thumbsup: Theme. As I said above, the more I play, the more the feeling of tension moving your slaves south to north is palpable.

:thumbsdown: Some randomness might frustrate people. Whether it&#039;s the slave catcher dice, the abolition card draw, or the slave market draw. Sometimes, if all three of those things unite against you, there really is no hope.

:thumbsdown: A couple of my cards have a small dot of some glue-like substance on them. It doesn&#039;t affect anything, but it&#039;s annoying. I think I have this in my copy of 1775, too. Maybe Academy needs to explore a different card printer. Otherwise...

:thumbsup: The production is stellar.</body>

What was your strategy for movement? In my game on Fri night, I played with the Preacher (-$1 to all conductor token costs at any point in the game). Saving $2 a turn, most turns, really helps so combine that with smart card purchasing (even a $3 card isn&#039;t too pricey!) and you can succeed.

What&#039;s hard is the need to always empty out the plantations and not exactly move the ones already on the UGRR, thereby doing what any city planner will tell you exactly not to. What&#039;s key is finding the time to move slaves to the East and using them to move the slave catchers in that direction. 

And that damned orange slave catcher is near impossible to position effectively. He&#039;s always in the way.

Good question. I think that ties to my epiphany. Movement is everything. Knowing when to push and pull and advance is the key to winning. If I figure out a solid strategy I&#039;ll let you know. :whistle:

I played this last month right after MLK day.  My order came the day after the holiday. 

I also purchased this game based on Radho&#039;s video.  However, I did not cry when I played the game.

I like the theme of this game because it is instructional. The idea that it isn&#039;t politically correct to discuss slavery and is something shameful is sad. The game does a good job of highlighting many people that were heroic in fighting slavery.  Many of those people were not directly affected but still worked to help those that were oppressed.  And then there were those who refused to give up and struggled to gain freedom for themselves and others.  Overall, pretty phenomenal.

As for the game play, it is easy.  But winning is hard.  I played two times.  I won the second play but I might have skipped a couple of steps. So I am calling this a &quot;qualified&quot; win.

	<body>After spending most of last year preparing for an exam in November I&#039;ve fallen behind on my reading.  Just last week I got back to Bernard Cornwell&#039;s Saxon Tales/ Warrior Chronicles.  They follow the story of  Uhtred of Bebbanburg as he attempts to recapture his family&#039;s ancestral Castle and lands from his uncle who userped him as a young child.

Which loosely reminds me of the plot behind Barbarian Prince, meaning I&#039;ve been looking to get this to the table for the last couple of days.

Starting at 1901 I&#039;m able to cross the river on my first attempt meaning I avoid the Royal Guards (that&#039;s never happened, I&#039;m already into uncharted territory here) and discover a town that doesn&#039;t appear on any of the regions maps.  A chance encounter with the Mayor&#039;s daughter leads no where, but the next day I manage to get an audience with the Mayor who, moved by my plight, writes me a letter of recommendation to the Lord of the nearest Castle.

Crossing the mountains I find a road which I follow south to the Temple of Zhur where a riddle is revealed to me that I believe refers to the location of hidden treasures.  Following the coded instructions leads me back north to the same region of the mountains I had previously crossed where I quickly discover a locked and trapped chest.  Keeping my wits I&#039;m able to disarm the trap and am rewarded with 48 gold pieces.

Following the mountains round the Kabir Desert I bypass a Portal of Darkness and come to Donat&#039;s Temple where I fall in love with the Priestess.  I convince her to elope with me and she goes one further, stealing 100 gold pieces worth of temple treasures before we make good our escape.  Needless to say, we am no longer welcome at the Temple.  

From here we follow the road south; the hunting and the weather are good and we&#039;re very much enjoying each others company.  It&#039;s been a little over 4 weeks since loyal Ogab smuggled me out of the castle following my fathers assassination, and for the first time since those days I feel that the fates are smiling upon me.  The great wheel of fortune that bears us all, and sometimes drags us down, is now starting to raise me up again.  

The road leads to Huldra Castle where I attempt to see an audience with the Baron.  He&#039;s a busy man and time and time again we get refused.  Feeling that he could be important to my quest I persevere, paying bribes were necessary to ensure I will be received before the Baron.  The I get a luck break and bribe the Seneschal who arranges an audience with the Baron.

[i]Now I hit a slight rules snag.  The Seneschal entry (E148) says &#039;If you pay this bribe, add ten (+10) and roll for seeking an audience(R211) once more.  Do I add 10 gold to the bribe, or add 10 the dice roll?  If it&#039;s the dice roll then why doesn&#039;t it instruct you to do this after you roll the dice?  Does anyone know what I should have done here?[/i]  

As it is, I roll 11.  A good roll, but only enough to let me pay my respects.  Then I remember, the letter of recommendation!  I look back through my notes, yes there it is; +2 to your roll when seeking an audience, and that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m doing!  My 11 becomes a 13 meaning the Baron becomes my Noble ally and he gives the order to prepare his army to march north and help me regain my throne.  

With my future Queen by my side I vow that, if any harm has come to loyal Ogab, I will seek those responsible and hold them to justice.  Then treaties will be drawn between my Kingdom and the lands of Baron Huldra and reparations made to Donat&#039;s Temple.  I will honour my fathers memory by honouring my debts and owning my actions.

But first, I&#039;m coming home!


:thumbsup:  It&#039;s refreshingly different from modern games.  If you&#039;ve enjoyed Fighting Fantasy etc. then you should give this a try.
:thumbsup:  It gives a really sense of adventure, crafting a different story everytime you play it.

:thumbsup:/:thumbsdown:  When you combine the unforgiving enviroment with the randomness of rolling dice it can seem very unfair at times.  I like this, but I understand that others might not.

:thumbsdown:  I seem to get lost, a lot.

Without any more information than that I&#039;d say add 10 to the die roll. Does the context give any clue? I mean, it seems to me, just from what you wrote, that the bribe gives you a bonus to the die roll, but who knows.

I had this game way back in the day when it was first published, and even had a little miniature of the Barbarian Prince at the time (around 15mm?). I did enjoy the game back then. Not sure why I don&#039;t still have it, except I had to weed out a LOT of stuff over the course of various moves. I know there&#039;s the PNP version around now. I think I&#039;ve downloaded it somewhere. The trick is finding time to do stuff!

Debrief:

After taking off from the 8th Air Force Base, on B-17 Provenceâs maiden journey, we headed east towards Germany. As soon as we left the coast of England we encountered three 190s coming straight at US. After trading fire with them, we were fortunate enough that they missed us and allowed us to continue on our way.

The journey to the objective continued relatively easily until we got over the objective. Thatâs when things got really hairy! Right before the objective we hit two waves of German fighters. We fought back valiantly but couldn&#039;t prevent being hit. There were just too many of them! The fuel tank on the port wing got hit and started leaking. The holes looked pretty small and we were losing fuel slowly. Will we make it home? We also got hit on the wing flap but to no negative effect.

Over the target we encountered light flak that did not hit us. 2nd Lieutenant Beaufort, our Bombardier, dropped our bombs on the objective. It looks like we hit our target!

Unfortunately, as we turned around, we hit another two waves of German planes. Our bombardier suffered light wounds and our Navigator, 2nd Lieutenant Nicholas, suffered serious wounds and our plane suffered some more superficial damage. Our engine #2âs oil tank was also hit forcing us to shut that engine down. Thank goodness that we had just dropped our bombs as this allowed us to keep up with the rest of our B-17 friends. We would never have made it home otherwise!

It took us a while and a lot of ammunition to finally shoot down and escape the German fighters over the objective. Our Engineer in the top turret had a deadly aim today as he shot down two enemy planes while the rest of the crew did a good job damaging some planes and scaring them away.

Leaking fuel over the Atlantic we continued our westward journey. We encountered ten more enemy planes on our return trip. Our radio operator replaced our seriously wounded navigator in order to man the guns near the front of the plane. For some reason most of the Germans were coming straight at us. And just when we thought we might get overwhelmed and never reach England, air cover rescued us by chasing away the last enemy planes in sight of the English coast.

Just as we saw England, fuel was running really low. An emergency airfield was identified and we successfully landed on friendly territory!

Inspecting the crew and the plane, it feels like the plane can be relatively easily repaired. However, weâll have to say goodbye to our Navigator who survived his serious wounds but will unfortunately remain an invalid for the rest of his life. He was sad to leave us but proud he had played his role on B-17 Provenceâs first mission!

Pilot: 1st Lieutenant St Exupery
B-17: âProvenceâ (B-17F-70-B0 42-29754)</body>

Glad to report that &#039;The Downtown&#039; managed to land safely back in Blighty after our trip to Germany. Our aim over the tatget was poor to say the least! However on the way home,our gallant Radio Operator did manage to shoot down an ME-019.

Wonder where we will be headed next?

Your detailed comments have me pondering looking more closely at this game.  Sounds detailed, and I like that.

	<body>[b][size=18]ORIGIN STORY[/size][/b]

This was [username=fractaloon] hosting month and he was celebrating &quot;Firsts&quot;, for the first anniversary. 

I was reading SGOYT monthly geeklist for a long time but never posted anything. However, it was the first geeklist, I ever subscribed to. 

Just can&#039;t remember how I found it, though. But the day I found it, I knew :
:star: I would never be alone in solo gaming anymore
:star: I would have to suffer temptation and resist the more I could. Sometimes, it&#039;s unsuccessful :D

About my first post, I do remember, accurately, this very moment  :  I was on holiday, seated on the sunny terrace of the Alps family&#039;s house, my favorite place on earth. 
It was such a perfect moment! 
I felt it was the perfect time to jump in and post my [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/172996/item/3198894#item3198894][b]first contribution[/url][/b] ever.

I chose DotZ as I was reading the rules and it was also my first Zombies game. 
It still own it, I still play it (more than ever, I&#039;ve so much fun with that game). 

Since that first post, I have met - virtually - some wonderful people. 

This and the first player guild are THE PLACES where I feel at ease and the only places I&#039;m acting in on the Internet.</body>

In addition to Kyle&#039;s Origin story challenge, I think this one is needed.

Still feel the same about the game now?

i love this wonderful yet little-known game. I have never used the era IV expansion, so I guess I&#039;m going to have to try and get it to the table this month. Good call.

I can&#039;t remember how I got to SGoYT (maybe I found the 1P Guild first?), but I also can&#039;t remember why I just came upstairs so yeah.  I&#039;m just glad I&#039;m here!  

The first game I posted was Roll Through the Ages.  I had just gotten it and was excited to see that there were official solo rules.  I remember Reverend Uncle Bastard asking me about it, and I was like &quot;aawww, people are talking to me, how nice!&quot;  Because that&#039;s what really impressed me about SGoYT and the 1P Guild - the people are really great and that&#039;s what keeps me coming back.  I read comments more than I post/interact, but there are good people with posts worth reading and that&#039;s valuable.  And the interactions are pleasant and often hilarious.

Yeah, so the lists hadn&#039;t cost me much (I had only bought Friday, $12) up until a few weeks ago when I bought the core set of Lord of the Rings The Card Game....and I instantly became very addicted to playing this game and collecting ALL the cards. So, now I am poor here in the real world, but oh so rich in Middle-Earth.

Played it at BGG.Con, but not solo.  Adds some very interesting aspects to the game. I&#039;d buy it if I weren&#039;t broke, I think.

Note that a lot of what it adds is interaction, so I don&#039;t know how it would play solo.

	<body>I picked the core set up a few weeks ago and was immediately hooked.  Man, this is a great game!  I&#039;ve bought most of the expansions and have been having a blast with deck building.  I read through some articles at Hall of Beorn and Tales of the Cards to get some tips on deck building - both blogs are tremendously helpful and full of SO much information. 

:thumbsup: I can play for hours and literally have no idea where the time went. So fantastically engrossing. Epic in every way.

:thumbsdown: As a living card game, this game can get expensive fast.
:thumbsdown: Deck building with all those cards can be overwhelming.</body>

Reading some of the posts in SGOYT has got me back into LotR LCG with consequent damage to my wallet :D

I&#039;m still at the stage of trying to get through &#039;Passage to Mirkwood&#039; :(
However I&#039;m having a lot fun losing and I&#039;m just going to try out a multi-sphere deck for the first time!

Reading through the blogs I mentioned above really helped me get my first wins under my belt. If you&#039;re playing true (one hand) solo, then it can be hard to win mono-sphere. Putting together a solid but basic tri-sphere deck made all the difference for me. And the card combos are so fun when they work out like their supposed too!

The saga expansions are designed to work with only the core. Though some of the quests are a bit tough, if you get them it&#039;s possible.

I&#039;ve only played the first Hobbit one and that first quest is really tough for a solo player (stupid trolls).

I think I&#039;ve read the LotR ones are a bit easier, but I don&#039;t know.  Bought them but haven&#039;t played them yet!

Check out &quot;Easy Mode&quot; perhaps? I think it&#039;s the way the game should have been released, actually, so I called it &quot;Story Mode&quot;. 

Here is my blog post with the video rant and a list of links:

There&#039;s no need to buy expansions before you&#039;ve beaten the core set&#039;s challenges.

It&#039;s possible to build a deck from the core set that will beat all three of those challenges (although it&#039;ll only beat Dol Guldur infrequently)  I used this one: [url]http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108855/back-basics-killer-deck-using-only-cards-single-co[/url].  

I felt a lot better about buying the Hunt for Gollum after that.  (That deck, unmodified, can beat all six of those challenges too.)

It&#039;s possible to build a deck from the core set that will beat all three of those challenges (although it&#039;ll only beat Dol Guldur infrequently)  I used this one: [url]http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108855/back-basics-killer-deck-using-only-cards-single-co[/url].[/q]
Yup, I used this deck (after trying out the recommended mono-sphere decks listed in the rule book) and had a lot of success.  I wasn&#039;t able to beat Dol Guldur, so I played two-handed with the two decks recommended at Beorn&#039;s Path (which only uses core set cards). https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/ 

Also, I highly recommend The Black Riders expansion.  You really only need your core set, plus the new player cards that come with the expansion.  If you would enjoy re-living the first part of Fellowship of the Ring, then this is expansion is for you.  Granted, it&#039;s challenging, but it&#039;s no Dol Guldur.

[q=&quot;BilboAtBagEnd&quot;]Check out &quot;Easy Mode&quot; perhaps? I think it&#039;s the way the game should have been released, actually, so I called it &quot;Story Mode&quot;.[/q]
I totally agree.

[q=&quot;Jude&quot;][q=&quot;suzyvitale&quot;]Reading through the blogs I mentioned above really helped me get my first wins under my belt. If you&#039;re playing true (one hand) solo, then it can be hard to win mono-sphere. Putting together a solid but basic tri-sphere deck made all the difference for me. And the card combos are so fun when they work out like their supposed too! 

Keep at it, and give those spiders what for! [/q]

I have only the base game, and as a solo game, I thought it was unbalanced and that a couple of the scenarios were pretty much impossible solo.  I can&#039;t afford to buy a bunch of expansions.  Is there one particular expansion that will work with just the base set and plays very well solo (and has replayability)?[/q]

Thank you for all the great links.  Just purchased this a few days ago to play solo and should arrive in the mail tomorrow. I can&#039;t wait to dig into it but it looks like I have a lot of reading to do first. Was there any good gameplay videos that you watched that helped you out?

I&#039;m not a huge deck building fan either but the good news is there are lots of advice and lists of decks that others have already put together.  The game play is what brings me back to this one and all the extra content that is available is just a bonus.

Rahdo&#039;s video is good for the overall &quot;how to play&quot; but not how to build a deck.

Reading some of the posts in SGOYT has got me back into LotR LCG with consequent damage to my wallet :D

I&#039;m still at the stage of trying to get through &#039;Passage to Mirkwood&#039; :(
However I&#039;m having a lot fun losing and I&#039;m just going to try out a multi-sphere deck for the first time!

My 10x10 challenge geeklist contains all of my defeats, maybe soon it might show a victory :p

I bought this in December and I still haven&#039;t tried it. I played CCGs through &#039;90s so the aspect of deck building seemed nostalgically fun, but sitting down to do it now seems overwhelming and tiring.I&#039;m sure once I actually get past that I will enjoy the game, but until then it is gaining a nice blanket of dust.

I just played this on Saturday for the first time.  I watched Radho&#039;s video which was enough to get me to buy the game.  I made quite a few mistakes the first go round and was dead in the water after turn 1.  LOL.  So I went back and watched a video series called &quot;Bumbling through Mirkwood&quot;.  It seemed appropriate because I had made a ton of mistakes.  After watching the series, I realized I had made even more than I thought.  Still think I need to watch a different video as well to see if others play differently.

Second play I won but I did not have to fight the big spider.  But I am not positive I played 100% correctly.  So easy to miss a step when you are thinking about strategy.

I found the game to be intriguing and fun.  And definitely a good addition to my collection.  I plan on getting the saga expansions for this game.  I bought the Black Riders and the 2nd Hobbit.

Yeah, i had this one for awhile, but gave up on it. I love the theme, i&#039;m an avid Tolkien fan, but i just couldn&#039;t get past the feeling that i was slogging through each scenario only to end up in defeat. I would then spend time ( and money) tweaking the deck, which has become tiresome in my 30&#039;s for some reason, and it just felt like work. Oh well...

There are quite a lot of fanmade expansions, which can be printed and used that way.

Maybe that would be a way to increase your fun with this great game! :)

	<body>My first game this month was going to be [thing=2324][/thing] but I had some problems with the counters. New ones are on the way (thanks Andrew). Next in line was [thing=60029][/thing]. I have the most recent (2014) printing (not the magazine edition).

[ImageID=2398280medium]
[i]Conducting my operations with surgical precision[/i]


First off, In order to be able to start moving in forces you need to take control of three zones: A, B, C. After trying to take the C objective several times I got the feeling something wasn&#039;t right. And sure enough. The new map has an errata where the order of the zone values has chaged from 4 3 2 1 to 1 2 3 4. Very low chances To snuff the NVA in the 1 valued C Zone with a MACV platoon sporting a combat value of 1. Rolling sixes was pretty difficult to say the least.

[ImageID=2399882medium]
[i]New US CRT[/i]


[ImageID=2399873medium]
[i]Old US CRT[/i][clear]


The game has a great narrative and I love the whole urban combat theme. It has great components and the counters are some of the best quality ones I&#039;ve seen. The rules are ok, but some areas was a bit unclear and I had to read them a couple of times before I got them right. Once you&#039;ve learned the rules [user=scrub]scrub&#039;s[/user] excellent [filepage=53977][/filepage] comes in handy. This is probably not a game you would play fifty times, but it should hold up to quite a few plays. 

:thumbsup: Great quality components.
:thumbsup: I think this is a better game than [thing=91010][/thing] (also from [company=15906][/company])
:thumbsdown: Errata on the new map. You guys had it correct the first time.

[b]The Bottom line: I&#039;m enjoying this game so far. [/b]

Pleased to read your thoughts on that game. I knew it by reputation and ordered it as soon as I read your comment in December SGOYT about availability. Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t had time to play it... yet.

	<body>Don&#039;t panic ! I haven&#039;t just played this ! It&#039;s my Genesis of solo gaming.

Come with me, if you will, to 1964 (whoosh). I&#039;m 9 and have asked for Monopoly as a Christmas present for a couple of years but haven&#039;t received it.

My Father was stores manager for a bus company and has brought home some advertising posters that were pasted on the side of buses for me to draw on the reverse blank side.

I borrowed the monopoly set belonging to the kids next door and proceed to make a full sized replica, including colouring and all the text on board and cards. OK it&#039;s fairly flimsy, but those posters were quite thick so it was perfectly usable. I played the heck out of it during the school summer holiday of 1964, with the Beatles dominating the air waves of the kitchen radio. Solo gaming was born for me.

I first found the SGOYT list about 4 months ago... I think I found it via the BGG main page summary.

The thing that keeps me coming back is undoubtedly the friendly nature of the list and the absence of angst and hissy-fits.

It would be really nostalgic for me if I did, but it was 51 years ago and at the age of 9 you don&#039;t do too much planning for the future :D

I remember enjoying making it at least as much as playing it though.

When I was a youngster I remember making a Shogi (Japanese Chess) set from cardboard. I don&#039;t think I found anyone to play it with, but I enjoyed making it and playing around with it.

Way back in the mid 70s when I was 9 or 10, my friend John always had the best things you could image. All the cool stuff. Eagle Transporter, he both type.

He had that game everyone was talking about at school, Monopoly. I think he set fire to to say he had burned money. Both Eagle transporters went the same way (to my horror) to recreate a scene from the show (Space 1999).

The pride of his toy collection Escape from Colditz, try as I might I couldn&#039;t pry it from his fingers despite begging, bribing, threats, blackmail or swaps. Another game was a pirate treasure game. You had this &#039;3D&#039; board, small men and a ship. You have to race to the top of the ?volcano?mountain? pick up the gold and race down. I loved it but he would never play it.

Any how, I found a copy of Monopoly in my neighbour&#039;s bin, and after asking if it was OK to take it, I was the proud owner of a near perfect copy of the game (one corner had split). We never had a lot of money so it was something of a luxury to me. It must have been my earliest intro to solitaire gaming as no one wanted in our house wanted to play it.

I kept it safe (at least I thought it was) in the top cupboard in my bedroom, but my 3 year old brother still managed to open the lower cupboards, climb the shelves, get it and destroy it. Mum didn&#039;t believe me when I said that he must climbed up and pulled it down. She said that I must have left it out. That changed when she went into my room a few months later to put ironing away and caught him five foot up the cupboard after a model kit I was building.  

Must be why I dislike the game today. Too may memories of sibling-destroyed games and toys.

PS: I eventually got my pre-teen hand on an Eagle Transporter but not the cool Eagle Freighter with the winding cargo winch and radioactive pods. Oh well such is life.

Some great Monopoly memories.  I could never get my family to play with me, &#039;it&#039;s too long&#039; they would moan - I now realise they were right!  I didn&#039;t have the imagination to think about playing it solo.

Anyway, did you see this story from yesterday (it&#039;s the 80th anniversary for Monopoly)?

PS - David, I still have my Eagle Transporter proudly displayed on my chest of drawers.  It&#039;s just about the only thing that survived my many many many moves.

I remember having one of those. Parents probably sold it at a car boot..... along with all my transformers and star wars toys. :angry:

Oh for the days when toys were made out of metal.....

Ho-lee crap. You just unlocked a whole memory closet. Space 1999. Yes, I vaguely remember that now, and I certainly remember having that transporter  (in white, I think though).

It did get there but some what limited pick up by networks. The second series run into the ground by the same guy that did the third series of Star Trek, Fred Freiberger.

Been drooling over the some of the newish production scale model kits, but they cost the same as a small second-hand car.

I have the season one bluray and I&#039;m attempting to watch it in &#039;chronological order&#039;, if such a thing is possible. The clarity of the picture real shows the woods grain in some of the acting. Fun stuff. Blake&#039;s 7 is next, although I only have season one.

Talking Anderson TV shows, the reworked Thunderbirds series SFX team (Weta) have posted a video of the new model work they&#039;ve build for the series. If they are CGI then they&#039;ve done good job of emulating the old model look although if they they are RW models they do look like they&#039;ve been built using modern model landscape techniques. The initial press release said &#039;real&#039; sets.

If you can get your hands on a a copy of the Thunderbirds board game released in 1966 you will find that Pandemic&#039;s game play is a pastiche of it and that was a co-op game too.... In 1966 !!

My firsy post was on the June 2014 SGOYT geeklist, on the same day I had picked up a second hand copy of this little gem.  I still own it, but I&#039;ve not taken it off the shelf since (checks)... early December!  Right, that will need addressing.

The group I had at the time prefered &#039;lighter&#039; games while I wanted something a bit more involved.  What impressed me was the number of solitaire games available, what kept bringing me back was how friendly and helpful everyone is.  I mean seriously Helpful (with a capital H), with you guys I never need to worry about having nothing to spend my hard earned on, or piles of money making the place look untidy and/or attractive to thieves.

I&#039;ve lost track of what was impulse buying and what was directly related to these lists, but as they haven&#039;t cost me my home or marriage I&#039;ll go ahead and say they have cost me a &#039;reasonable&#039; sum of money.  It&#039;s been worth every penny though, except for [thing=102652][/thing] (but that was my own fault). </body>

	<body>[size=18][b]Origin Story[/b][/size]

Way back in the ancient times (also known as May 2014), I was on a spree of solitaire PnP games. I believe it was a comment on one of the entries for the Solitaire PnP Competition that led me to SGOYT and I have never looked back. I posted my first post to SGOYT and it was this fun/thematic but tough to win PnP game. 

[user=davekuhns][/user] jumped right in with advice on making the game a little more balanced. 

Later that month I posted about [thing=148729][/thing] and [user=often][/user] generously gave me enough GG to finally get an avatar!

Since that fateful time I rarely miss a day on SGOYT, it has become my favourite part of the interwebs. I have even made a friend and gaming partner in real life from this list, the one and only (or one of two actually) [user=moe45673][/user]

============================================

[b][size=18]Origin Story Part Two[/size][/b]

My very first introduction to solitaire hobby gaming was at the age of 11. As a smart, wise-ass kid (nothing&#039;s changed), my teachers would try to find ways to keep me busy when I finished my work early to keep me from disrupting other kids in the class. One day my grade 5 science teacher, who also ran the schools gaming club, sat me down in the back of the class room and handed me an Ares magazine, told me to read it. It contained [thing=4516][/thing], a two-player game about battles of the Norse gods. I set it up on the table in the back and proceeded to learn the game, playing both sides. Since that day I have loved gaming. In the heady social days of school there was much D&amp;D, Car Wars, Battletech and Stratomatic Baseball. Lots of folks around to play games with then.

I fell out of the hobby for most of my adult life. I began to get the itch to return in the last few years, but I didn&#039;t have a group of gamers to play with. However, exploring at my FLGS I noticed some co-op and solitaire suitable games. Picked up Legend of Drizzt and Zombie Survival. The games turned out to be just ok, but I was hooked on gaming again.

In an effort to buy better games, I found (and joined) BGG. This led me to a vast array of fantastic solo and co-op games, starting with Arkham Horror and a bunch of great PnPs. Then on to SGOYT which has cost me easily in the range of $800 in the last 9 months.

Right now is a renaissance of solitaire gaming, and I am happy to be in the midst of it. Having this place to come and discuss solitaire games, celebrate wins and commiserate over losses, and lure each other into spending all of our money, has been an amazing addition to my life.

Thanks to everyone here for the motivation and support! Game on!</body>

[thing=148729][b]Maquis[/b][/thing] - a fantastic worker placement game about the French resistance that is fairly easy to print. It was actually my second post to SGOYT. I printed the [user=Ilya 77]Ilya 77[/user] redesign that has these great standees:

[thing=140060][b]Shadows Upon Lassadar: Siege at Kurth[/b][/thing] - a great [user=dumarest123]Todd Sanders[/user] game. Quick (10-15 min) rondell siege game where you run around the track fighting off invaders. Added a pathfinder figure as the player marker to make it pretty!

I second the Lord of the Rings: The Adventure Deck game as well as Supermarche.

I will also add that [thing=19212][/thing] and [thing=34639][/thing]

This was my first posting to the SGoYT Geeklist back in April 2014.  I can&#039;t strictly remember how I stumbled across SGoYT.  I got Zombicide for my birthday the previous November and that re-lit my gaming hobby fire, as did the discovery of the whole world of BGG making gaming seem mainstream and helping with all those pre-internet &quot;I don&#039;t understand this bit but no-one else I know has heard of let alone owns the game&quot; questions.

Anyway, I do recall I got addicted to Ricky Royal playthroughs and in particular Robinson Crusoe stood out as a type of euro adventure game with narrative I was keen on - I was sold!  It was expensive but a &#039;local&#039; (well, Dublin - 4 hours drive away) OGS eventually got it in stock and once it arrived and I had played my first game I was so pumped I just had to tell someone about it and the first and only people I thought may be interested were you lot.

This list and associated Guild have made solitaire gaming that much more fun for me.  Gaming is great but chatting to someone about your gaming just adds chrome to the whole experience so thank you all for that.  Of course this means you shall be regularly hearing occasionally from me for many moons to come!

Sorry about that! :yuk:</body>

I had seen a few posts mentioning SGoYT but had no idea what it stood for so assumed that it was some geek thing that people just pick up on after being on BGG for long enough (like FLGS). Late last year I found the 1 Player Guild and saw the Solitaire Games on Your Table geeklists but still didn&#039;t put two and two together. Until I saw the microbadge, the name with the mouse over text made it clear what the acronym stood for.

So, I decided to look through Decembers list and remember thinking that this was something I could do with my plays. Part of my new years resolution was to be more active on the site so starting in January of this year I began logging all my plays and adding my solitaire plays to the January list. The first thing that stood out for me was the variety of solitaire games being played (the first 31 items in December were unique and there were 327 different games played over the course of the month). I also noticed how supportive every one was of other peoples plays.

My first game was Dominion (it was a Christmas present for myself). As it has only been 1 month I still own it and do not see me selling it off anytime soon.

I keep coming back (if you can say &quot;keep&quot; after 1 month) as the lists are a great way to get an idea of how a game plays and if I will like it. I&#039;ve already bought [thing=121921][/thing] as a result of Januarys list. So far I have only spent Â£55 (~$85) on games because of the list but I also Kickstarted 5 games last month so I have deliberately held off buying more games (other than [thing=156501][/thing] which I had to buy before it goes out of stock everywhere again).</body>

My first appearance was back in [listitem=2675590]June 2013[/listitem] with trying to get [thing=123955][/thing] to the table as well as actually playing [thing=134172][/thing] a couple of times.

If I remember correctly, I discovered the list through BGG&#039;s front page and was probably made curious by Ryan&#039;s sympathetic Avatar. :)
[user=ryanmobile][/user]

I still own [thing=134172][/thing] but have not played it since. Maybe time to get it back to the table. 

I did not return to the list until February 2014 as an active poster. Mainly because I did not find time to post and/or play solitaire games in the 2nd half of 2013 (moving house and all such stuff).

However, the seed was planted and since discovering this super friendly community of solitaire gamers, my focus on solitaire gaming has been sharpened quite a bit and I did discover (and buy - yes, buy) more solitaire games than I would have thought about back in 2013. Did not count how much money this list did cost me and probably do not want to tell anyone, anyway. :cool:

	<body>[size=18][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

Where to start? I have always played board games, all the way back to my childhood. Always had good to awesome groups and always played solo but only for the learining process.

The first solitaire board game I played for the fun of it and not just for getting into it faster was [thing=15987][/thing]. So this is some kind of gateway game to solitaire board games for me. And it spread the virus to look for more.

I was lurking on BGG for months until I finally signed up. Too many bad experiences on other boards made me go this way. I signed up in march last year. And it&#039;s like an addiction. You click one game and end up in 10 others. Which is a good thing!

When I found out about Guilds, I subscribed to a few and one of them was the 1 Player Guild. I found it the most active and inspiring Guilds of them all. So much information and such a good motivator! It&#039;s like an engine that keeps my solitaire gaming running.

I just started posting in the SGOYT list in january. Again... lurking first, posting later. First I wasn&#039;t sure what to post, what can I write etc. I came here because I wanted to find out more about the most active community within the BGG community. Sounds like a secret agency within an agency. :D

Got myself the member badge, and started posting in january. [thing=22][/thing] that was. And I posted it a few times during my journey of learning. And I am still over it.

My first visit here was a marathon of clicking through threads of interesting games. My wishlist grew bigger and bigger. I like that! The cult of the new is not a bad thing! I actually play my games, not only store them...
Anyway the amount of good, friendly and helpful people and the mass of information here in this guild is why I am coming back, every day! It is an addiction.

I don&#039;t know how much money I spent because of this list but my wantlist is a big monster now. I can for sure say that my focus on games has changed since my first visit here. I have an awesome group with a weekly meeting but we have tons of games already for it. Board games and RPGs. So my focus is more on solitaire games now than on a 2-5 player game. I play more solo than with my group.

Keep this engine running guys. Maybe I am part of it and can inspire someone else like you did with me. :thumbsup:</body>

	<body>This month, I am continuing the Campaign with Garkhaan and Fenn.
You can follow my progress on my blog: [blog=3847][/blog] and, more specifically, the mission phase by phase, using Redjack&#039;s automated Imperial player cards: 
[o][b]ROUND 3[/b]

Time for the rebels to activate.

[b]Garkhaan&#039;s 1st ACTIVATION[/b] strikes the Elite Nexu, and kills it.

The probe droid closest to Fenn activates: it is going to attack, inflicting 3 more wounds on the rebel, bringing him at 13 wounds (of the 22 of his current state).

then, for its second action, it engages Fenn and moves in front of him, blocking his way.

[b]Fenn&#039;s 1st ACTIVATION[/b]
Fenn doesn&#039;t bother with the probe droid, and moves close to the terminal, and interacts with it (its color is [COLOR=#0066CC]BLUE[/COLOR]) so he has to take am INSIGHT attribute tests, and he makes it!!!!
1 down, 2 to go.

[imageid=2398310medium]

The second Probe Droid activates, and engages Fenn, and then attacks him and inflicts him 5 more WOUNDS!!!!

[b]Garkhaan&#039;s 2nd ACTIVATION[/b]: the Wookie attacks twice the blocked door, and BLASTS it!

this initiates the DEFENSE protocols sequence, and he finds another NEXU inside the bunker.

The Nexu, then activates, and he pounces on the Wookie, and deals him 4 wounds!

[b]Fenns&#039;s 2nd activation[/b]: he attacks the closest probe droid, using 1 strain to perform a BLAST attack: inflicting 2 damage to one, and 1 damage to the other.
Then Fenn attacks again, and inflicts more wounds to the droidsâ¦ things are note looking goodâ¦ 

[imageid=2398332medium]

[b]
END of the third ACTIVATION PHASE.
[/b]

[b] STATUS PHASE[/b] 
1) Threat increases to 6 !!!!!
2) everyone readies (garkhaan has 13 wounds, and 4 strain; Fenn has 18 wounds and no strain)
3) will the Imperial deploy? YES! An ELITE NEXU appears, and it appears right behind GARKHAAN!!!

I love the homemade trees!   

Are those filling in for something that comes with the game, or is this some sort of custom scenario that needs more than what&#039;s included with the game?

Yea, the trees, unlike the walls, for which I took time to find textures, print, build, cut, etc, were drawn and cut on cardboard in 5 minutes... Chubby, but funny thing, they work quite well.

I just placed the trees where black lines are on the map: they serve the purpose of making clear, at a glance, what blocks movement and LOS.

Initially I made only walls (base/bunker and and hut_like walls), but then I realized that scenarios like this don&#039;t have msny walls but take place in a forest-jungle setting, where trees would be be more fitting.

Edit: I didn&#039;t realize the auto correct on my iPad messed the post so much :modest:

Cool.   I assumed the walls came with the game because the look of them fit so well.


Regardless, this game has now &quot;officially&quot; earned a spot on my wishlist.  

It&#039;s all (or at least mostly) your fault.

	<body>This was my first ever play of this game. I have played [thing=133437][/thing] a few times on my lunch break with colleagues but that plays completely differently to this.

I played with the [thing=104590]Wizard&#039;s Tower[/thing] expansion.

The game lasted about 2 hours (mainly because I had to keep referring to the rules) and came down to the final possible move of the game. All the walls were destroyed and 5 of the six towers were destroyed. The only one left was the wizard&#039;s tower. There was one enemy left on the board and he was in the castle and one space away from the tower.

I drew my cards and had nothing useful so discarded one of them and picked up a wizard card. This card allowed me to deal one damage to one enemy even inside the castle. So with my last attack I killed the enemy and won the game. I&#039;m not sure in real life it would be classed as a victory if you only have a 6th (or 12th if you include the walls) of your castle left standing.

The three additional mega boss monsters didn&#039;t really pose too many problems. The Dragon was killed off with one card. The Chimera moved into an area that I had plenty of cards for so only lasted 2 turns. The Necromancer was also killed on 1 turn with the use of a couple of cards. The biggest problem actually came from the original boss monsters. I hadn&#039;t seen any of them for the first three quarters of the game so when I drew the Goblin King I knew something bad was about to happen. The first additional card drawn was Orc Warlord, the second was a general monster, and the third was the Healer. Having these on the board at the same time made things much harder and caused most of the damage to my castle.

:thumbsup: - It is a challenging game and with different combinations of cards in my hand with monsters drawn it could have been a different result.
:thumbsdown: - I prefer the mechanics of Dead Panic. I like that the players only get cards when they are in the middle but that they can go out to attack zombies that are too far away to hit otherwise. The only thing that game is missing are bosses.
:thumbsdown: - Archers and knights should be able to attack in all rings leading out to their ring. What kind of knight runs past a monster that poses an immediate threat to the castle just to hit one that cannot do any damage to the castle.</body>

A charging one with restricted vision due to the narrow slit in his helmet?  :D

I am hoping to get some plays of this game in this year, too.  I have the Wizard&#039;s Tower expansion, and the &quot;any color&quot; promo card, but have only played the base game so far, and only co-op.  It is on my tentative list for the Normal (non-hardcore) 10 x 10 challenge.

The any colour cards are very useful and I can only imagine how beneficial an any colour hero card would be.

Don&#039;t forget if playing solo you can discard and draw 2 cards instead of 1. On a few of my turns the second card was more useful than the first and saved my walls from taking damage.

	<body>The [thing=159503]Captain is Dead[/thing] is a co-op game, but it can be played solo if using 3 or more characters.  The theme is that the ship is surrounded by hostile aliens, is badly damaged, and only a few of the crew members have survived (not the captain). They must try to repair the jump drive and escape before the ship is destroyed.  Unfortunately, the ship continues to take damage...

There are a lot of options in this game: having many different characters with different skills and abilities to choose from (or randomly select); deciding which ship systems to use with the limited actions available; deciding which repairs are more imperative; and whether to spend skills and actions on gaining tools, more skills, and/or upgrades or to try to make do with what you have and concentrate on fixing the jump drive and shields.  With the randomness of the Alert cards causing more problems for the ship and crew, I suspect that this game will have a lot of replayability!


[COLOR=#FF0000]February 1, 2015[/COLOR]

:d10-1:  I played [b][thing=159503]The Captain Is Dead[/thing][/b] for the first time, using three characters (Chief Engineer, Tactical Officer, Scholar) while playing solo.  I lost horribly, losing my shields and then taking another hit to them.  Boom. 

It didn&#039;t help that the 5 initial Alert cards (not defendable) disabled my teleporter, computer, and external sensors, injured two of my crew members, plus damaged the shields.  Shortly afterwards, my torpedo tubes were disabled plus aliens were crawling all over my ship!

Planning to try again soon.


:d10-2: For my second solo game of [thing=159503]The Captain Is Dead[/thing], I decided to play with 4 crew members.  I chose the Chief Engineer and Tactical Officer again, plus the Soldier and the Janitor.  I found that the Soldier was surprisingly useful for many things, like getting Battle Plan cards, launching torpedos, and also using the security station, while the Janitor came in handy for fixing systems, especially after I got him a tool so that he got an extra action.  

I think I got lucky this game because the 5 initial Alerts didn&#039;t damage the Comm, Teleporter, or Computer (that came later ;) ).  Life on a spaceship is so much easier when those systems are functioning! I never did manage to get any upgrades, but the Battle Plan cards really came in handy.  

[b]I managed to win, barely fixing the Jump Core with my shields completely down.[/b]  One more shield hit and that would have been the destruction of my ship. 
 


========

:thumbsup:  I like the theme.  The game is hard to win, but it is suspenseful rather than frustrating.

:thumbsup:  There are many strategies to consider and try.  Also, there are many different characters to try so it should have a lot of replayability.

:thumbsdown:  The rules, especially for the Kickstarter edition I got needed some clarification.  But there is an errata sheet on the company website, and a PDF of the updated rules.  And the designer is very quick to answer all questions here on BGG. :thumbsup:

:thumbsdown:  This is a minor quibble, but the small cards are just a bit too wide.  They almost didn&#039;t fit in the FFG mini-sleeves.</body>

I&#039;m really enjoying this one.  So quick to learn, set up and play (especially if you keep losing as I do).

I&#039;m also seeing my plays getting better - I used to lose as soon as I hit Orange Alert, in my last game I was one Jump Core repair away from victory (on Novice level).

Good game.  And I&#039;ve only played with the same three characters so far...

Admiral, Janitor and Teleporter Officer.

It feels like the Janitor is almost essential but I should try others before concluding that!

Maybe I&#039;ll try the janitor.  The scholar and (and to some extent, the tactical officer) wasn&#039;t very useful with the computer inactive most of the time.

The boards colors actually make it easier to play, because the room colors match the token color of the crew member that starts there and usually is most effective there.

I am a longtime solo gamer, not only playing wargames and sports replay games solitaire by playing both sides, but also playing such solo games as [thing=1608]Ambush[/thing], [thing=1681]Tokyo Express[/thing], [thing=1032]B-17[/thing], [thing=4556]Patton&#039;s Best[/thing], [family=2246]Tunnels and Trolls[/family], [thing=2678]Voyage of the B.S.M. Pandora[/thing], [thing=6927]Hornet Leader[/thing] (the GMT version), and and other (and newer) solo and co-op games.  

I had seen [user=ryanmobile][/user]
around the Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations forums pretty often, and had geekbuddied him.  One day in September of 2013, I noticed that he was posting in a geeklist called &quot;Solitaire Games on Your Table&quot; and that&#039;s how I discovered SGoYT!

My first post was a friendly chastisement of Ryan for not telling me about the geeklists :D :
http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/161764?commentid=4044830#comment4044830

and then I posted about my plays of [thing=65564]Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations[/thing] and [thing=141067]History Maker Baseball[/thing] that month.  I still play both games and they are two of my favorites. In fact, they were two of my entries in last month&#039;s SGoYT, and are part of my Hardcore 10 x 10 list:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/182184/judes-10-games-10-times-challenge-2015-and-other-g

Having had a really terrible time (in almost every aspect of my life) for the previous year and a half up to then, I really appreciated finding a place to share my solo gaming and hang out with a good community. :)

Jude, keep your chin up if you can.

Both my parents have passed on, I had a near-fatal car crash 20 years ago, I had a VERY stressful career and my marriage of over 35 years is over. Very few people have stressless lives, even though it&#039;s hard to see that when you hit bottom.

Boardgaming and to a large extent solo gaming is one of the chinks of daylight for me.

I took early retirement with my company pension last July and now I want to have some ME time.... oh and travel  :)

Keep shuffling that cardboard :D

My favourite games are ones that aren&#039;t made-for-solo, playing both (or all) sides. I get much more thematic enjoyment from those.

	<body>Got it to the table and played the Viral side again. 

I was progressing really well, managing to find cures for multiple viruses on the board. This made for a good level of funding throughout the whole game. Death Toll marker was getting close to the end and only 1 virus left on the board - however needing 4 molecules still. All randomness regarding the needed 14th round was taken when I drew a card with an automatic advancement of the death toll marker.

Famous last words: &quot;So close, so close ...&quot;

Keeping to my usual remarks for the game:
:thumbsup: Still a fun puzzle game with sufficient randomness to create tension.
:thumbsdown: Some turn order info on the board would be really helpful.
:thumbsdown: Would like to see a different randomizer for the advancement of the death toll marker.

----------------------------------------
Update 8-2-15:

Played another game on viral mode, still with the die-roll for the death toll. This time mankind was saved! Dr. Foster and Marvin to the rescue! Game went rather smoothly, even though Dr. Monroe left employ the round right after I hired her. The die was kind enough to lead me into Pandemic right when I needed it to put Marvin to good use. :whistle:

:thumbsup: This is currently the game I turn to when I just want to play and not work my brain too much.</body>

Hello!

I am wondering what you mean with &quot;Would like to see a different randomizer for the advancement of the death toll marker.&quot;.

Do you have anything specific in mind or what do you hope to see changed?

Yours,
Deathworks

Good question. I do not have anything specific in mind right now.

However, the single die roll (modified by the card and by an occupied C-space) feels totally unthematical and too random to me. This leads to frustration rather than any tension at all. Roll badly and the game is over after 9 rounds without anything you could do against it. 

I like the randomness in the way the virus behaves, the random draw for the molecules in the incubator, the random offer of equipment and personnel as well as the lab events. Only the random die throw on the death toll track feels out of place to me.

Have you tried the Overtime Without Pay Viral Variant? It can help mitigate bad die rolls. :meeple:

	<body>Playing this one two handed with the preset decks to get the rules down.

Then I&#039;ll move onto the AI from [thing=34499][/thing].

So many different symbols to know.  Starting to get the hang of them.

What other expansions for the game are good to have for playing solo?  I expect I will get them all but if there is a real stinker I&#039;d like to avoid it if possible.  Even if it kills a little of the completionist inside me.

[b]EDIT 2/3[/b]

Finished a two handed solo game last night.  Blue beat Red 39-29.  Blue&#039;s start world was Epsilon Eridani (world #2) while Red started with Alpha Centauri (world #1).  Red just couldn&#039;t get any good consume powers out there.  And the ones Red did get out gave cards and not VP&#039;s.

I&#039;m starting to see that there are many different ways to get VP&#039;s.  Seems that it would be hard to predetermine a strategy since it would depend on the cards you get during the game.</body>

From what I understand none of the other expansions work well for solo.

But you can play on BoardGameArena against live players (or turn based) to improved your play... or in my case reveal how dreadful you are. :)

Lol, thank you for saying so. Now I know I&#039;m not the only one who is bad at this game on BGA. My first game on the site, where I thought I had a clue how to string some combos together, ended suddenly with me in last place with 18 points and the next guy having something like 50 points.

However I will mention that my ability to play this game against other people doesn&#039;t change the fact that Race is my favorite game right now.

Actually the entire first arc (gathering storm, rebel vs. imperium, and brink of war) all work well solo. They all include chits for the AI for the new start worlds. The only thing is they introduce some new mechanisms (military takeovers etc.) which are optional for multiplayer and not used for solo. They are worth getting for all the new cards even if the new (optional) mechanics are not used solo.

It is important to note that the expansions are part of an &quot;arc&quot; so each previous one is necessary for the next one. If you have gathering storm, get RvI next, then Brink of War. The Alien Artifact expansion is part of a second story arc and is not compatible with the first three expansions.

If you get Gathering Storm then get at least RvI. The variety in home worlds is worth it, and I never used military takeovers even in multiplayer.

I got all the first arc expansions which are good for multiplayer and solo, although you can&#039;t use everything solo.

I like prestige both in solo and multiplayer games. Takeovers I never use (not possible in solo).

I think so - I learnt the game two handed, playing the sample decks myself as suggested in the rulebook. I then played a few games multiplayer (with other humans) before playing solo against the robot.

I didn&#039;t think of using the robot to learn, so not sure if this is possible. I think its useful to learn the main game first as the robot solo game is an adaptation of this.

Yup. Never, ever get attached to the first cards you are dealt, by the way. Your strategy will likely have to change, and getting attached to one particular strategy at the beginning usually doesn&#039;t end well.

I went straight to the robot to learn how to play. Got the hang of it pretty quickly, but that doesn&#039;t mean I beat the robot. Well, once so far, but I am starting to get closer and closer. The robot was designed to emulate the outcomes achieved by top players, so it actually makes an excellent way to get better at the game (Moe still beat me in my only two-player play of it though).

I was looking at the Robot rules and it doesn&#039;t seem so bad so I plan on using it from here on out.

I also tried the Keldon computer version of this but I don&#039;t think I understand the game enough yet to use it.

I picked up RftG from a game shop in Taunton while travelling to Cornwall two years ago. We got a parking ticket as I forgot to set the time dial properly on the wife&#039;s blue disability badge when she took a tumble getting out of the car. Tried the Keldon computer version and had the same problem. I&#039;ve several tutorial and play example videos tagged to watch and one day I when skies are blue . . . usual problem, can&#039;t get my head around rules these days.

GAME STATUS: Still in the cupboard along with the robot too.

I played a single two handed game to get the gist of the mechanics of the game and then switched to the Robot AI from [thing=34499][/thing].  The Robot is really well done.  You can learn the game playing against it.  It&#039;s actions are described very well in the rules.  You can just focus on how to play your cards.

I&#039;ve played against the Robot now 4 times and am 2-2 versus it (in easy mode).

You should give it a whirl, the player aid cards in the box pretty much layout how a turn should go.  After a couple games the symbology all starts to make sense.

I prefer to ai to Keldon for solo too, though the Keldon program is really well done. 

After two or three games you&#039;ll wonder why you thought the symbols were confusing in the first place. They&#039;re really straightforward and make a ton of sense.

2-2? That&#039;s impressive!

The only mistake I made playing my first few robot games was with scoring. Instead of scoring 6 point developments as just 6 VPs, I was tallying up their value as if they were a regular player. Once I changed this I ended up losing more often.

Both wins occurred because of bad draw luck by the robot.  It would draw to find a Dev and turn up only worlds, exhausting it&#039;s draw pile.  Or for Settle it would only turn up Dev&#039;s or the opposite type world it was looking for.  If the robot has no cards to play with then it isn&#039;t pushing the 12 card end of game condition so hard.

The other two times it has smoked me.  One game it seemed to roll nothing but Consume and Produce.

I may have been doing this wrong also but I don&#039;t really remember the robot getting many 6 Dev cards played.  I&#039;ll try to remember this.

It took me a few games to realize that the special 6vp token AND the 6 cost developments both get scored as 6 points. The couple of games before that where I scored the robots 6 cost developments as per normal it generally only got 1 or 2 points for them.

Thanks for making me go through the rules to find this.  The 6 Dev counters and cards are actually scored the same depending on the difficulty level you selected (6 or 9 VP each).

I was also misplaying by not counting the 6 Dev counters as cards and keeping them separate.

	<body>[size=18][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

Long time lurker, first time poster.

I got interested in solitaire games simply because there isn&#039;t always someone to play with. My wife isn&#039;t into many games, and there is only so much you can do in the evenings with an 11 yr old daughter (who loves games) and a squirrelly 5 yr old that always feels he needs to be included.

Also -- I started a new gig as a contractor and my first assignment was at a place... well, not to friendly. Since I had no one to play games with at lunch (which I had before) I started PnPing some 1-player games. It was the PnP list that grew me here -- I think someone mentioned this list or the Guild in the comments. I&#039;m fairly sure that someone was [user=reverendunclebastard][/user]. Of course, since then I traded for a copy of [thing=43570][/thing], which I&#039;ve only played once and found both frustrating and fun at the same time.

I think my first was [thing=90730][/thing] (that&#039;s my build on the photo) and then [thing=94476][/thing]. I looked back and haven&#039;t posted on this list before which is a bit surprising.

This is such friendly list! I enjoy it here.</body>

Welcome! Hope to see more posts from you, especially PnP games. I am always on the lookout for games to print up.

A quick suggestion then. ;)

If you haven&#039;t printed up [thing=96703][/thing] then you really should. It&#039;s an easy build (or, like me, get from ArtsCow). I&#039;ve had quite a bit of fun with it. The end game is a bit yadda-yadda but it&#039;s a quite a ride (or, er walk) to get there.

	<body>[size=18][b]Preamble
[/b][/size]
Part 2 of my exploration of the Battletech Introductory Box Set where I dive into the basics of ranged combat!  In Part 1 I explored melee combat.  You can find it here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1301981/solo-play-and-preliminary-review.  

For the purposes of learning the rules, the 4 mechs I picked to run this mission represent every class of weapon in the Introductory Box.  

[i][u][b]IMPORTANT NOTE:[/b][/u][/i] Throughout this report, I reference a song called &quot;Everything Is Awesome&quot;.  A link has been provided at the bottom of the post.  For maximum immersion, it is highly reccomended you listen to this song on repeat as you read this play-through.

[ImageID=2382978 large inline]
This mech is not included in the introductory box, but the cool map is! (Notice the cardboard arm cannon :) )

[size=18][b]The Game
[/b][/size]

Fresh off his last victory, Commando strides cockily onto the field with another much larger friend, Awesome.  Awesome pipes out a never ending loop of the Lego Movie theme song over his mechâs external speaker (seen mounted above his head).  

[i][b]The volume is set to [size=12]11[/size].[/b][/i]

[ImageID=2382980 large inline]

And in this corner; Hermes and Catapult!  Herm and Cat hate childrenâs movies.  Thus Awesomeâs musical tastes disgust them to no end.  âItâs time to hit the mute,â mutters Cat.

[ImageID=2382981 large inline]


[size=18][b]DEPLOYMENT
[/b][/size]
From above we can see Herm and Cat to the north.  Cat intends to stay put, gaining a defensive bonus from the woods heâs in while launching devastating long range missile attacks against any mech that tries to cross the open ground.  Herm will run interference.

[ImageID=2382979 large inline]

Awesome and Commando have wisely placed the woods between themselves and Cat.  Awesome will post up in the woods to provide covering fire for Commando, who will try to flank around the east end of the board.


[u][b][size=14]TURN 1
[/size][/b][/u]
Commando goes sprinting to the eastern grove of trees while Awesome slowly advances towards the southern woods. 

Line of Sight can be blocked by 2 heavy woods hexes, 3 light woods, or 1 heavy and 1 light.  Commando and Awesome are careful to remain out of Cat&#039;s LOS.

Herm runs to cut off Commando and Cat sits and waits. His time will come.

[ImageID=2382982 large inline]

The first attack of the game!   Much like melee, to hit with a ranged attack you factor in a pilot&#039;s base gunnery skill + his movement + the targets movement + terrain modifiers:  Commando finds he needs to roll an 11 for his weapons to hit Hermes.  Not a likely roll.  But screw it, fire all weapons!  

Commando has two sets of Short Range Missiles (SRMs) and a Medium Laser (ML) and will need to make a hit roll for each weapon.  SRM4... miss.  SRM6... miss.  ML... hit!   Laser weapons have fixed damage.  This particular Medium Laser causes 5.  Roll to determine where it hits... Center Torso!

[ImageID=2382983 large inline]

Herm is feeling a bit chagrined at Commandoâs good luck and makes a pot shot of his own, also needing an 11.  Miss.  Naturally.


âEverything is Awesome!!!â booms over the field.  Cat squirms with distaste. &quot;Childish rubbish...&quot;

[ImageID=2382984 large inline]


[size=14][u][b]TURN 2[/b][/u][/size]

Commandoâs team lost initiative, which means he has to move first.  Commando advances into the woods, preparing to flank Cat.  Herm, taking advantage of moving second, is able to circle around Commandoâs back.

[ImageID=2397753 large inline]

Because Hermes is directly behind him, Commando won&#039;t be able to shoot at Herm with all his weapons.  Commando has to make a choice: He may torso twist left to blast Herm with his Medium Laser (mounted on his left arm) or my twist right to let off a volley from his SRM4 (the 4 means this launcher looses 4 missiles per volley).  The SRM has the higher damage potential, so he chooses that option.  *bing-bang-boom!*  Three of the 4 missiles hit!  Torso, Right Arm, and Head!  Herm takes 1 pilot damage for the head-shot, though he manages to remain conscious.

[i][b]âSAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!â[/b][/i] Hermes cackles with evil glee as he unleashes his [COLOR=#FF3300][b][size=12][u]FLAMETHROWER[/u][/size][/b][/COLOR] at Commandoâs vulnerable backside!  [i][b]âBURN IN HEEEEEEEEEELL!â[/b][/i] Herm screams, as he quickly checks his rules to find what sort of horrific fate awaits Commando....... 

.....

.....

.....

[size=8]*ping*[/size]

..... 

â¨2 damage and absolutely nothing else.  

Turns out flamers donât do anything special.  All of Hermâs actually useful weapons miss.  

Naturally.

[ImageID=2397755 large inline]

Awesome has a shot at Hermes.  He fires his 3 PPCs (Pow-Pow Cannons?) and one hits, nearly blowing through Hermâs left leg armor.  These things cause 10 flat damage.

Cat launches a round of LRMs at Awesome for a big olâ miss.


[size=14][u][b]TURN 3[/b][/u][/size]

Herm attempts to block Commando, who sidesteps and dashes madly towards Cat.  Doh.  

âFollow me, Awesome!  Chaaaaarge!â  

Awesome makes no moves.  

What a jerk.

[ImageID=2397756 large inline]

This is Cat&#039;s moment!  Commando is in the open!  Cat fires all heâs got!  

*WHOOOOOooooooosh*

Cat misses with all heâs got!

Commando returns the favor by missing all of his shots!  Oh the thrills!

Awesome, on the other hand lands 3 PPC hits against Cat, causing a massive 30 damage spread over Cat&#039;s Left, Right, and Center Torso.  Because he has taken over 20 damage in a turn, Cat must struggle to keep his Mech from toppling over.........  

Success!

HEAT ROUND:  Those 3 PPC shots generate a ton of heat, more than Awesome is able to shed, and the buildup has inhibited his movement.  He suffers -1 movement until he can cool off.


[size=14][u][b]TURN 4 - 7[/b][/u][/size]

Commando walks behind Cat, Herm runs after Commando, Cat turns right to get a better firing angle at Commando, Awesome slowly plods through the woods, rocking his tunes.

*zappy-boom-pow* various shots are exchanged.

[ImageID=2397757 large inline]


Awesome begins his charge (ponderous walk) towards Cat.  He needs to close the distance fast, before Cat blows him to pieces with LRMs.  But Long Range Missiles have a minimum range requirement that make them almost useless at close combat.  If Awesome can just close the gap, he&#039;ll gain a significant advantage!

[ImageID=2397758 large inline]

BOOMY-BOOM!  Awesomeâs greatest fears are confirmed as he takes major LRM hits!  Fortunately his exterior speakers survive the barrage: âEvery thing is cool when youâre part of a team!â

Awesome answers with 2 PPCs (he holds back the third to avoid building heat so he can regain his move point).  2 Crits!  Cat loses a Medium Laser and a jump jet.


Herm points his impotent flamer at Awesome.  âHalt, you musical philistine!â

[ImageID=2397759 large inline]

Herm recieves 2 PPC hits to the face.  Fatality!

[ImageID=2397761 large inline]

Commando has been quietly chewing away at Cat, who has lost his Center Torso armor.  Cat&#039;s gyro and engine have taken hits, and most of his weapons are offline.  Heâs remained standing, but itâs looking grim.

[ImageID=2397762 large inline]

Cat has realized heâs been wasting his time swatting at Commando when he should have been focusing on Awesome.  That crappy music must be stopped!  Cat breaks the sacred oath of âno meleeâ and desperately kicks at Awesomeâs Right Leg, simultaneously firing with his last operational Medium Laser.

[ImageID=2397763 large inline]

Now that the gloves are off, Awesome delivers a punch that neatly removes Catâs right arm!  

Commando follows up with an SRM volley that ignites Catâs remaining Long Range Missile ammo!  Catapultâs last moments of life are spent in bliss, as the roar of a massive internal ammo explosion finally drowns out that accursed song!

[ImageID=2397764 large inline]

âEverything is awesome when weâre living our dream.â

[ImageID=2397765 large inline]


[size=18][b]THOUGHTS[/b][/size]

The battle started with some interesting tactical situations; trying to keep in cover and going for a flanking maneuver.  Unfortunately, the actual ranged combat wound up feeling a little bland.  Part of this is due to the fact that I&#039;m only using 2 mechs on each side.  I can see where more mechs and more varied terrain would add some spice, and I&#039;m looking forward to trying out a bigger, terrain heavy battle next!  

The weapons provided in the base set are also very straight forward.  For the most part it was point at your target and fire all weapons.  Damage is mostly fixed, and it&#039;s just a question of if and where you hit.  There is the choice of splitting fire, though I never found myself in a situation where I could try that out.

Missiles were the most interesting weapon from my point of view, as you never could tell how many would actually hit, and they tended to sprinkle damage all over the target instead of a single location.  

I loved how ranged weapons introduced a need to manage heat!  The more powerful weapons can build up heat that will quickly gimp your mech.  There are a lot of interesting choices to balance between maximum firepower, maneuvrability, and maintaining low heat levels.

The box comes with two advanced mechs that are loaded with new, more complex weapons systems.  My third and final exploratory scenario will include those two mechs and some more complicated terrain.  But as for this battle, overall I felt a bit underwhelmed with the ranged combat.

[i][b]SPECIAL NOTE ON THE FLAMER
[/b][/i]
I expected the flamer would have some interesting heat mechanics to make up for its minuscule damage, but when I went to look up the rules for it (mid game) I couldn&#039;t find anything in the introductory rule book.  I had to go online to find out that officially, flamers don&#039;t do anything special in mech-vs-mech combat.  They&#039;re just a crappy weapon.  Perhaps the crappiest of weapons?  Now a lot of people suggest a house rule variant where instead of damage, flamers add heat, and I shall play that way from now on.  It was just odd that the base box would include a mech with a flamer, but didn&#039;t provide any rules for it, one way or the other.


[size=18][b]SOME MORE PREMATURE THUMBS[/b][/size]

:thumbsup: A nice array of weapons to try.
:thumbsup: Tons of potential for interesting tactical situations!
:thumbsup: A few advanced mechs and weapons included (untested).
:thumbsup: Missiles are awesome!
:thumbsup: Heat management is an interesting side task.

:thumbsdown: Some fixed damage weapons felt a little dry to me.
:thumbsdown: Difficult to manage a lot of mechs during solo.
:thumbsdown: The Flamethrower does not have rules in the Introductory Rule Book.

Great report and nice supporting pictures.

Brings back old time memories (20+ years ago) of fun Battletech sessions with friends during my senior years in High School and the first years of University. I always loved equipping my mech(s) and have them stand their test in the skirmishes against friends.

Now, where is that rulebook again... (goes searching)

This report was...wait for it....Awesome! (I just watched the LEGO movie the other night!)

Flamers are explained a little better in [thing=31760][/thing]. They can deal their damage as either heat OR damage. Flamers are primarily used as anti-infantry weapons.

I always played that the flamer did both heat AND damage.

Always felt that the anti-infantry weapons in this game were pretty cack - even when used against infantry.  :)


@Josh Murphy - awww, you didn&#039;t use the AC20?  Shame...

In terms of tactics, I would have charged the Catapult forward in this matchup.  The problem is that his 2x LRM 15s just don&#039;t compare against the 3 x PPCs that the Awesome has.  The Awesome can output amazing damage at medium to long range but at close range, his small laser is worthless (although he can still do nasty melee damage).

While I&#039;m on the topic, while I loved the idea of missiles, I always felt they were pretty ineffective (at least until you get some clan gear - but lets not go there yet).  The problem is that the damage is too spread out.  Even if you hit with both LRM15s, you might only get a total of 15-20 damage depending on how lucky you are in rolling the number of missile hits.  Even then, that damage is spread out across different armour locations (and don&#039;t get me started on SRMs where each missile does 2 damage to a different location!).

Even after taking into account the reduced heat profile, it seems that having big hitting weapons is generally better as its easier to punch through armor and start doing internal damage (which is critical to reducing the opponents battle effectiveness).

Also - great writeup and pictures!

I&#039;ve been slowly reading through the rules of the newest introductory set. And the Total War book I bought to complement it. :whistle:

Don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll have the time to play it but I&#039;m looking forward to that time when it comes. It looks like a really fun game.

Oh, and keep these Battletech reports coming. Long is good when there&#039;s a story and great pictures.

I should add that if reading the Battletech rules, background stories, and mech sheets is as fun as playing the game then the game should be a blast. Until then it makes for some fun board game reading.

The battletech universe has been very well fleshed out. There is plenty of fluff out there to keep anyone busy for a long time. I haven&#039;t read any of the fiction yet, but I plan on it one of these days.

I haven&#039;t mentioned it in any of my write-ups yet, but all the written game material shows an extraordinary degree of polish.  The prose is precise and easy to understand.  It really is a pleasure to read.

I failed miserably on my first outing of Scenario #1, and ended up quitting at Turn 8 on my second outing (I had really having trouble concentrating on it that day.)

	<body>Today&#039;s game restored my faith in this game again. After two easy wins in my prior games, this one (still on easy level) kicked my butt. And we all know that Co-op games need to do so in order to stay challenging.

Random character draw saw me playing the Stockholder (taking a mulligan as first random draw was the Preacher, [b]again(!)[/b] :) ). I was moving along very well, had 4 slaves stacked in Northern Cities, ready to moved to Canada, 2 support tokens, enough money for the third and even still some space on the Lost Slaves Track. And then came an opposition card, forcing me to give back a support token (I had incorrectly read this as a Fundraising Token first *doh*). This crushed my plans as I would not get enough money to buy 2 support tokens again...

Some clever card-line management on my behalf could have prevented this opposition card to become activated. So, mostly stupidity on my behalf for misreading the card&#039;s text.

However, this kept the game from moving to the trade pile. :)
 
:thumbsdown: The solo game feels a bit too static at the moment. Would love to play it with more than one in order to experience some additional dynamics.
:thumbsdown: Set up and tear down time almost equals playing time. So either play two games in a row or take some more time thinking out moves. ;)
:thumbsup: Even while being a bit static, it offers an optimization challenge of making good moves through quickly crowding spaces.</body>

White guilt is compelling me to play this for Black History Month here in the USA... That and it&#039;s a great game too.

As for solo game doldrums, it&#039;s a coop, just play two characters.  Co-Ops should never ever have a player count on them, except a range 1-number of characters/roles available.  Number of players in a co-op should never be equated to number of characters.

IMO

Arne, I think the card that caused your loss actually has no effect in the solitaire game, except for the third phase. This is because as soon as you buy a support token, you&#039;re in the next phase. The card states to return one support token that was bought &quot;this phase&quot;. This can only happen if you have bought the third support token but have not gotten 5 slaves to Canada.

Great report!

As for solo game doldrums, it&#039;s a coop, just play two characters.  Co-Ops should never ever have a player count on them, except a range 1-number of characters/roles available.  Number of players in a co-op should never be equated to number of characters.

Agree for the most part! The only time it matters is when there&#039;s a traitor mechanic.

I understand what you are saying. The crazy thing is, that, while I like solitairing multiplayer games with more than one role, I usually stick to one player with co-op games. Cannot really say, why. Maybe my brain-parts rather like to play confrontively than cooperating with each other (which could explain a lot of other things :p ).

Won a sealed copy of this on ebay last week at quite a discount. Taking a while to arrive though. 

Had the expansion cards for months, so I thought I better get the game to go with them.

Ordered the slave catchers and a red lantern too.

If it was the Nat Turner Rebellion card - it seems to affect any support tokens previously purchased: &quot;If support Tokens have been purchased by the group, return one to the currently active Action Token row&quot;. This card has lost me 2 games  :angry:.

I think it just means return to the currently active period/column, even if it was purchased from a previous period/column. The rule book explanation for this card says &quot;Players can never go back a period&quot; so the placement of the token at least allows you to buy it again, if you can afford it.

	<body>[size=24][b]ORIGIN STORY:[/b][/size]

This was the first game I posted to the list, back in June 2013.  I think I just spotted the list off the front page and decided to post it.  I had the game for a while, and had done one of those &quot;I AM GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME&quot; things, and pulled it off the shelf and sat down to attempt to play it.  Again.  Maybe for the third or fourth time of attempting to play it.

I know there&#039;s a game here, but for the life of me I get lost in the rulebook (like I tend to do a lot.)  I relearned [thing=1608]AMBUSH![/thing] last year and played it, so I&#039;m more familiar with what&#039;s going on in Open Fire, so maybe this year I&#039;ll pull it off the shelf again and give it a go.  I know OTHER people have actually played it, so...

I don&#039;t remember a whole lot about the other games on the list, then.  Even though I&#039;ve been a BGG member for over a decade, I only recently started posting more and more on here.  And I still tend to NOT subscribe to a whole lot of threads.  (Finding yourself subscribed to something like the SGOYT lists and logging on the next morning to 50+ posts just isn&#039;t my style. Especially if I&#039;m not involved in the conversation)

I enjoyed being subscribed to the other ones I&#039;ve posted on, but have taken myself off them because I find myself thinking about wanting to buy the games, rather than play the ones I have.  There are enough games out there I WANT without having OTHER ones added to the list.

I&#039;m still a lurker.

	<body>I can see me playing this game for years. I just love it; the fact that it&#039;s becoming my Arkham Horror surrogate is really the only thing I could hold against it - and even then, I&#039;m not sure they&#039;re so different any more. It took me over an hour to set this up, in the wee small hours, this morning. I have both expansions in the base set, and it really now feels like it&#039;s losing the &quot;fast AH&quot; deal. As much as I like the extra cards and encounters of [thing=164167][/thing], I just didn&#039;t want to be dealing with the extra board, this time. 

So, took lawyer, George Barnaby, and handyman, Wilson Richards, up against Shub-Nicorette-patch, whilst borrowing a few details from the big box expansion (such as the prelude card - although I&#039;m already not sure if that isn&#039;t just more needless fluff; I&#039;ve played a lot of this game in the past year, and I still don&#039;t see that it&#039;s getting stale and in need of shaking up like that). 

This was a weird game because, despite what felt like lousy dice rolls when it really mattered, I just dominated the board. At one point there wasn&#039;t a single gate open to trouble our boys. I know the lawyer has influence, but that seemed like a very unlikely deal. I drew a few of the softer mythos cards, and was able to tool up and get to work on the three mysteries: Blasphemy of the Black Goat, Nature of the All-Mother and Spawn of the Black Goat. Two of these simply require the death of an epic monster. Given George&#039;s insanely high influence (and thus the ease with which he can buy from the item reserve), both men went full-Rambo, and rolled up to each lair. For the record, whilst I never fuss with spells that often, the combination of Hyperborean Crystal and Arcane Tome feels close to godly. 

For me, the game scales really well, and I&#039;ve always felt like I had a slim chance of winning - but I&#039;ve never felt so monstrously over-powered before. It was nice to be along for an easy ride... and I still love the stories this builds. Does Arkham Horror deal with narrative any better? I think so, if only because there feels like more consistency in its smaller world. That said, EH remains one of my very favourite games. 

I should do a top ten some time, right?

I&#039;d really like to do one; maybe in some anniversary or at a certain milestone of plays. God knows how I&#039;d boil these lovely things down to a top ten though. I often think &quot;Man, this is easily in my top ten&quot;... but I&#039;ve lost count of how many times I&#039;ve said it.

I&#039;m still holding out. 

I&#039;ve no doubt it&#039;s a game I&#039;d like, just not sure I need it already having Arkham Horror fully expanded. Not looking for a more streamlined version. I think I&#039;d rather play the full epic AH.

I&#039;m with you on this (although there are still a few AH expansions I am missing). Given that I am trying to slow down my purchasing, I am going to hold off on this one as long as I can.

	<body>Played the solo/cooperative variant of this game that comes in the rule book.

All three tribes survived to the end of the game leading to a victory, although it was close. Had it been a competitive game I&#039;m sure one of the tribes would have died out.

The Tunit went down to 1 worker on 3 occasions. Luckily that worker was the alpha so guaranteed another worker the next round with some of the cards that were in play. The Norse had some very good dice rolls and ended up with 9 valuable hunting cards in their tableau and every single worker either on permanent placements or in their hunting allocation. The Thule ended up gathering resources nearly every turn but had some bad dice rolls so tended to lose as many workers as they gained.

All three tribes stayed with Polytheism as there was no incentive to switch. All the cards ended up on the cold side and there was only 1 unrevealed card at the end of the game. With victory points not meaning anything, a lot of the cards that would normally have been taken into the hand ended up staying in play. The tokens ran out half way through the game and so I ended up having to use a score tracker to represent [-]energy[/-] iron token levels per player.

Had it of been competitive, the scores would have been: Norse = 29, Thule = 11, Tunit = 10.

:thumbsup: - For such a small game it has a lot of variety and options.
:thumbsdown: - It can be difficult to see all the benefits you have with all the cards in your tableau plus any opposition daughters you are married to.
:thumbsdown: - The cooperative game lacks some of the fun that the competitive version has.</body>

I found the solitaire experience very dry compared to playing it competitively with three players. While I enjoyed it I can&#039;t see myself playing it again solitaire.

	<body>Me and [thing=22][/thing] again,

reached the third encounter, I am sure I still play a few things wrong but at least I am playing.

One thing that I must find a way to do better is the set up part of this game. I stored everything in little plastic bags but even then it takes sooo long until you can start playing. You almost have to play 2 games or you feel like it&#039;s not worth the time.

[ImageID=2398559]

Somehow I don&#039;t like the idea of the victory requirements. Maybe it&#039;s great for a multiplayer game but for a solitaire play I prefer to go out and fulfil a quest. And that&#039;s what I did. I took the Book of Quests and decided to play the first one, Dragon Slayer, with the Black Knight.

[ImageID=2398558]

Yes I have the whole Book of Quests printed, at work of course! :p

So my quest was to find the Hoard or Lair first. Then rescue the girl, kill the dragon, get rich and famous and take the girl home for.....

Anyway I was moving around the map in search for that damn Lair or Hoard but I couldn&#039;t find it. My first fight was against a big spider which I took down easily. I already started to think &quot;Am I playing this correct?&quot; Maybe I read too much about the fighting system and that it is so difficult and hard to get into BUT I think I played it correct. Correct me if I did not!

[ImageID=2398560]
[ImageID=2398561]

Half way through the month and map I still couldn&#039;t find that damn dragon. I had to fight only a few monsters and I am not sure if that is usual? I am always wondering if I play that part correct. I mean 14 days and only a handful of fights? Monster roll and chits don&#039;t fit so no monster gets summoned, right?

I was checking rules back and forth so many times that I didn&#039;t realise I was about to enter a map tile I already was, but this time from another direction! And this time monster roll and chits fitted. More than I liked it.

[ImageID=2398562]
[ImageID=2398564]

I fought the two giants, even managed to take one down, but the second one crushed me in round 2. Dead. No clue where the Hoard or Lair was. :D Guess my helmet was too dirty and I missed some paths or ways which I should have taken. If only that kidnapped girl screamed loud enough for me to hear or gave some smoke signals for me to see. Nothing.

Anyway,

:thumbsup: with the Book of Quests, this game is a lot of fun solitaire.

:thumbsdown: just writing down my victory requirements is good for learning the game but in the end not my cup of coffee.

:thumbsdown: Set up time compared to play time... it takes so long to set up that you almost have to play at least 2 games or it&#039;s not worth the time!

:thumbsup: With some imagination you can create endless adventures, high replayability! And this is what makes this game so good I think.

I start reading the magic part now. Reading rules here is a real study but it&#039;s worth it! Can&#039;t wait to play the whole game.</body>

This sounds correct; the Black Knight shouldn&#039;t have much trouble defeating a Heavy Spider.

Most battles in Magic Realm aren&#039;t difficult to resolve, once you&#039;ve gotten the hang of it... but the combat system is different enough from that of other games that beginners sometimes have difficulty understanding how it&#039;s supposed to work. And occasionally you&#039;ll have a battle that really is complicated.

[q=&quot;Andreas Kaiser&quot;]Half way through the month and map I still couldn&#039;t find that damn dragon.[/q]
That&#039;s because you&#039;re playing solitaire with a single character. If there were, say, four players in the game, each with their own character/Quest, you would see where the Hoard and Lair were very quickly.

Once you feel more confident in your understanding of the rules, try a solitaire game where you have two or three characters competing against each other. It will be a much better game (although much harder to play and much longer).

[q=&quot;Andreas Kaiser&quot;]I had to fight only a few monsters and I am not sure if that is usual? I am always wondering if I play that part correct. I mean 14 days and only a handful of fights? Monster roll and chits don&#039;t fit so no monster gets summoned, right?[/q]
Correct. Again, this is a problem inherent in using just a single character: not many monsters will show up. This is why the official solitaire rules specify the use of two Monster Rolls (10.E.1.7), although that&#039;s not a perfect solution.

Thank you very much. I forgot to do two Monster rolls. Next time! I am still in the learning process. The rulebook always in one hand. I am so worried to forget something while exploring the realm that I forgot that completely...

I&#039;m really tempted by this game, but it still seems a little intimidating.  I might hate it, but I actually get the feeling that if I put the time in to learning it properly it might just obsolete the whole of the rest of my collection. :D

Also, there are 8 pages of files for this, which ones do I need to print to have a complete game?

Man, I should be taking notes here. Hoping to break this out, properly, in the next couple of weeks, for the first time. The phrase &quot;learning game&quot; seems hopelessly optimistic.

	<body>I picked this game up August 2014, between then and xmas/January I have had multiple attempts to read and follow the &#039;walkthrough&#039; - not sure why, but I never managed to get through it all.

I think the main problem was not seeing the big picture of why we did certain things... why raid? why build up military? is having a high ferocity good or bad? ... but why, what difference do they make, where is this heading and why?

Anyways - I decided through January I would force myself to understand and just dive in.

Boy do I wish I had done this earlier. The game has so many moving areas of the game, the map, raids, AI tokens and then tracking MP, AP, military points etc - along with the different levels of families and passage of time. Everything subtly links everything together - the &#039;clicking&#039; point of this game is to me understanding how it all links together.

Back to my first point - the walkthrough is a great idea, but to me it does not portray the &#039;glue&#039; between everything.

So anyways I finally completed my first full game (scenario 2) with a minor loss just last night. I wanted to write this post, not to describe my game or tactics - but more for a flag to anyone else in my boat to persevere and see this game through.

Its a deep game, lots of rules! but very thematic and in the end I begin to &#039;feel&#039; for the families. Shadows of Malice is on my table today, but I will be going back to this after !


:thumbsdown: Found it difficult to get started, lots going on.
:thumbsup: :thumbsdown: Rule book is actually very good - it just doesnt explain to well how everything interacts and why.
:thumbsup: Great challenge once everything is in place, not an easy game to win, but that keeps you coming back.
:thumbsup: Fantastic board, very detailed and adds more to the theme.
:thumbsup: Once you get going, has that just one more card feel to it.

Thanks for posting this Michael. I&#039;m still at the stage where I&#039;ve played the tutorial, and found myself doing stuff simply because it told me to do it, and not actually getting any idea of why I was doing it.

I think I need to tackle this more traditionally - actually properly read and understand the rules, and set it up and play. Playing the tutorial feels a little like jumping into the middle of a tv series with no idea who the characters are, and what the story is really about.

This game does have a big upfront investment, both in learning the rules and then understanding the game. But it is well worth that investment as this is an awesome solitaire experience that gives so much back. Stick with it, keep playing, and your epiphany is guaranteed! :)

+1

I think the epiphany moment comes once you&#039;re able to play at a quicker pace, which obviously requires a level of comfort with the rules. Once you start knocking out cards a little faster, the relationships in the mechanics appear. It&#039;s really fun to experience.

I had the same issue and I found several good video tutorials that help. I generally read the rules and then look for a video tutorial to make I am doing it right. I do love this game and plan on getting it back out within the week. Had a huge snow storm here in northwest Ohio and being a sub teacher that means several days home. only problem is twin almost 3 yr old boys and a 7 yr old daughter that wants to beat me in checkers real bad. so far she is 1-4.

This game is stymieing me.

Its been setup in my basement now for what, three weeks? I love playing when I&#039;m down there, I&#039;ve completed the walkthrough, and now I am just intimidated. I don&#039;t have 2-3 hour bursts to play lately (just like 30-45 minutes here and there) and now it just feels disjointed. But I don&#039;t want to stop trying. And then I get frustrated and walk away. Then I come back. AUGH! :D

I&#039;m pretty sure this is eventually going to become one of my favorite games; I can feel how awesome it can be. I just need to get there!

Agreed. I originally ran through the play through, not fully understanding what I needed to do next. So I decided to play the first scenario (without the play through). While doing so, I continued to read and reference the rule book, at times spending an extra half hour to go more in depth with the rules.

This helped immensely.

Had the game set up for a week last year and played every day through the walkthrough. I kept banging my head against the board wondering the same thing - ok, I know how to do this but WHY should I do this??? I could only ever see the trees and not the forest. After chipping away at the walkthrough and trying it on my own, my wife eventually made me give the kitchen table back. I knew once I folded the board up it would never come back out . . . And it hasn&#039;t :( I want SO bad to learn this game and have that lightbulb moment. It would be so awesome if someone did a video of a playthrough with explanation of why they were making each decision. Like, &quot;I think it&#039;s time to go on a raid because . . .&quot; 
At any rate, I&#039;m sure I will pull it back down eventually because I know a great game when I see one, but of all the many games I&#039;ve played, this is my toughest nut to crack.

Yep. This is how it goes. The [b]why[/b] of choosing actions is definitely the most difficult. In fact, after you get a full game under your belt, hindsight is your best teacher.

I tend to raid early and often (in hopes of getting horses to move around easier, while also hoping to draw raid cubes to mitigate any subjugation cubes that will come out). Then, if tribes are active, try to start building diplomacy with them. Plant some corn and hold onto it.

Then you have to think through: Do I need to plan to get more actions to get more trade goods to adjust my culture/military track so I don&#039;t lose? So you plan, and add a child/man/woman/elder marker into the passage of time so hopefully you&#039;ll add them onto the track, make another family, and have more options.

	<body>Hello!

Yep, I played another session, actually starting in the evening and taking it past midnight (with a few breaks in between, of course). The AI got really lucky with getting high scoring developments and worlds. I think I could have won if the AI had made a different choice for the final round (we both selected produce, but if either of us had had ship, I might have gotten a lead of 1 or 2 points) - but reality is, it beat me 47 to 42.

I also did a [thread=1312415]small flavoured session report[/thread], so please feel free to have a closer look at the details.

[b]Likes:[/b]
+ Lots of randomness - random tiles drawn from a bag, rolling dice to determine what you can do
+ Beautiful tiles - I am a sucker for illustrations, I admit
+ Lots of interesting decisions - use a tile as development or world, which die to return to the cup, which to leave in the citizenry, ...
+ Addictive - finishing a session, you really want to play again
+ [thread=1298979]Simple and good solo variant[/thread] - I am quite happy with it as it does not change many rules
+ The player screens include all rules - yep, using easy to learn symbols. Even setup is included, so once you have read it once, you only need the rules book for rare questions.

[b]Dislikes:[/b]
- Plastic cups - they provide cups for rolling the dice, but since they are hard plastic, they are too noisy
- Thematic mix - some worlds are planets/places while others are more like situations; this makes flavouring it somewhat difficult
- Weird cash markers - okay, they are wood and that is nice and all, but I can&#039;t remember how often I toppled mine when reaching over to the AI&#039;s area (^_^;; And besides, what do they represent?
- A few of the tiles are initially hard to grasp - space is limited, yes, but adding a bigger explanation in the rules could have helped with things that are not immediately obvious (but make sense once you know)
- Not enough cuteness

Yours,
Deathworks

Thanks for pointing out the solo variant. I just got Race last week, but I was debating weather to get Race or Roll. Knowing that there is a good solo variant out there is a relief, though not a relief to my wallet.

[i]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/i]
I think from the front page, when I was slowly getting back into solitaire gaming myself.

[i]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/i]
[b][thing=126426][/thing][/b]. I have passed it on to a friend of mine, I felt I had enough plays from it (around 10 I believe).

[i]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/i]
Just how warm and welcoming the community was, and how small it was compared to now! :)

[i]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/i]
I had been lurking on the previous two months&#039; lists (September 2013 was my first posting). It was liberating to post!

[i]What keeps bringing you back?[/i]
The community, more than anything else. And to check out any solo games I might enjoy myself, the reports written up are great indicators for me if I will like a game or not.

[i]How much money have these lists cost you?[/i]
Few hundred euros I would say. :shake:

	<body>Wife and kids are gone, snow is blowing . . .sounds like a good time for some solitaire gaming!

I backed Harbour and just got it yesterday. Trying out the official 1-player mode. You have a dummy player that follows some simple rules.

The first game I got 4 building before the dummy got any. I decided that didn&#039;t seem right so I went to the forums. From [thread=1311155]this thread[/thread] it seems that the dummy doesn&#039;t make any decisions at all -- that if it comes to deciding something, it gets one of each resource. Any decision.

So for the second game I played it that way and the dummy triggered the end of the game (i.e. it bought it&#039;s fourth building). We tied but that was dumb luck -- it bought the Pub for $7 but it&#039;s only worth 5 pts. I should have won.

I&#039;ll probably be playing this a bit more today. It&#039;s pretty fun.</body>

It&#039;s a bit stupid that TMG&#039;s fulfillment partners didn&#039;t generate emails with tracking when they were shipped. I assumed they would and then saw comments in the KS page about people getting it.

Not well I&#039;m afraid. I used the 3 recommended &quot;first time&quot; buildings and one of the Wharfs as my character.

The Test Dummy built his fourth building shortly after I built my second and I was unable to purchase another one, so I was schooled 37-20.

The 2 random buildings that came out after the recommended 3 didn&#039;t help me too much early on but certainly helped the Test Dummy collect a ton of goods. He was only prevented from buying a building 1 time due to a lack of goods so it was tough keeping up with him, even through market manipulation.

Guess I have my work cut out! :D

[/q]

The Test Dummy churns pretty fast. I&#039;m  not sure how to stop him from buying every time he hits his home building, except to buy right before he can to change the market. I was like you -- he bought a building all times around but one time. And (as I said) one of those had low points which is the only reason we tied.

I wonder if it would be easier using someone else besides The Wharfs?

Since the last update (19th Jan) saying they were through customs I am (and seems most EU backers are) still waiting for something, the game or dispatch email or an update, but it&#039;s all gone very quiet.

Delays are understandable, lack of communication is not.

	<body>OK, settle down.  I have the rule book, not the game, on my table, as I volunteered to help proofread the near-final materials.

For those who aren&#039;t aware of this game, [thing=68820][/thing] is a game on the Battle of the Bulge, and it is three games in one: two player, Allied solo and German solo.  Probably the most important second thing you need to know is that is designed by John Butterfield, he of D-Day at Omaha Beach/Tarawa, RAF and Ambush fame.  John Foley is developing it, and you may recognize his name from his development work on [thing=21050][/thing] series and [thing=39217][/thing].  Compass Games is producing it, meaning you can expect top-notch graphics and physical components.

I have to say after reading the two-player and German solo rules and charts that I am more excited than ever to see this on my table.  It could be a breakthrough in solitaire game design.  I have never seen someone attempt something so ambitious in terms of defining AI behavior.  It&#039;s a card driven system, but uses the traditional hexes found in most wargames.  Each of the three games uses its own map, and has its own set of special rules.  And the amount of work that has already gone into the game was evident from the very few edits I made to the rules and charts. 

But it is hard for me to make a judgment based only on reading the rulebooks.  The proof will come with the play, and be warned, this is not a light game.  It is several steps ahead of the D-Day game in terms of complexity.  I put it up there near Fields of Fire in terms of the amount of rules you will need to absorb, especially as each version of the game will require a new set of rules to remember.  The player aid cards do a good job of summarizing the key steps, and I imagine the first few times I play my nose will be stuck firmly in those cards.  I&#039;ve suggested to the developer that they put together some good tutorial videos, as this may help to absorption process.

And yes, this game has all the things that go into a Bulge game, such as fuel dumps, blown bridges, traffic congestion, Monty &quot;tidying&quot; his lines,  Allied air power, the Von der Heydte unit, etc.
   
Anyways, you might want to put this game on your radar, and consider pre-ordering when it is $105, versus the $145 list price.  Yes, this is high, but keep in mind you will be getting three games in the package.  The Compass site lists a May 2015 release date.</body>

I just read about Ardennes and found it fascinating, how the Germans did one last push that almost succeeded (am I right in stating that it failed due to the Germans running out of fuel and not necessarily due to any allied brilliance???)

And is Bastogne an objective? Does the bulge grow historically? I can barely handle traffic congestion in Freedom Underground Railroad, will this torpedo my chances at ever achieving victory in this one?

The German&#039;s Ardennes offensive really never had a chance of succeeding.  It was too ambitious.  Several German generals tried to convince Hitler to do something smaller but he overruled them.

The designer (John Butterfield) and developer (John Foley) make quite a dynamic team, and they&#039;ve been refining this one for a long time.

Hope it turns out to be a big hit for Compass Games.

I would say the final CoH solo design is about 50% me, 50% Academy.

Thanks for the update, Paul. I preordered this a couple weeks ago. Despite the hefty price, it just sounds too good and unique to pass up. I mean, an innovative, truly solitaire WWII game is just what I would love, so why not? Glad to hear it continues to impress.

As someone else said, this could be a great year for innovative solitaire wargames.

I haven&#039;t read enough on it to make it worth the MASSIVE PRICE they&#039;re asking.

I know it&#039;s basically 3 game in one, but 100 bucks is a bit too much for me.

I know. I waffled as waiting to hear reports was my plan too, and then decided it&#039;s pretty much the type of solitaire WWII game I would want -- Battle for France, card-activated, unique system -- and then figured if I don&#039;t want it, I should be able to recoup most of my money anyway.

That&#039;s what I did with Were there is Discord.

And I definitely recouped my money for that one.

	<body>[size=24][b]ORIGIN STORY![/b][/size]

I was bitten by a radioactive grognard...

Well, not really.

So, this isn&#039;t actually the first game I posted here, but that honor goes to [thing=41612][/thing], and seeing how Lhowser owns my copy, I won&#039;t get a chance to play it again.

So I&#039;ll post the game that I was going to initially post, but decided against.  

I found the list on one of those first few days of the month bonanzas where it&#039;s on the &quot;hot&quot; list on the geek&#039;s frontpage.  I had just finished a game of Field of Fire, but decided against posting it because I had just posted it in another geek list, and I thought that&#039;d be tacky.  I was new to using the geek then.  This was back in June 2013.  As I looked over the first few games I posted, I realize I&#039;ve sold most of them, which is sort of funny.  My gaming tastes have changed quite a bit, but a few of the games I&#039;ve held onto have stayed as really solid solo games: Gears of War, Hornet Leader, Fields of Fire.

I think I&#039;m going to try to play a lot of Fields of Fire this month.  It has near infinity replayability due to different maps each game (though the layout is the same, the terrain will change), and the vast differences in action results or enemy placement.  The rulebook is a bit... crappy... but the game is really complex, and doesn&#039;t build on any wargames out there (except maybe for some similarities to Up Front, or Frontline: D-Day), so it&#039;s hard to take skills from other games to apply them.  But there&#039;s a lot of game in here.  I&#039;ve played the first mission like 6 times and it never felt the same.  It&#039;s time to complete a WW2 campaign and then maybe switch over to Vietnam, as I haven&#039;t even TOUCHED that one.

I tried this when it first came out and it felt like I was fighting the rule book more than the situation.

They put out a new rulebook on the GMT website that is supposed to have cleared things up but I never went back and tried again.

I&#039;d like to try it again but it&#039;s not near the top of my play list.

I&#039;ve only ever used the second edition rulebook and it&#039;s much better.  I still recommend playing it with the rules handy in PDF format so you can search for answers you&#039;re looking for quickly.

The game tells the best story of any wargame I&#039;ve seen.  It&#039;s basically a war movie in cardboard form.  Small squads doing heroic things, or being surprised by blundering into a field covered in land mines (lost my first game on the second turn because I moved a whole squad into an area I hadn&#039;t scouted and they did just that).

I also love how the game is more about issuing orders than following specific tactics.  Sometimes you troops won&#039;t get your orders right, or you can&#039;t get a runner to them in time, and the phone lines have been cut.  Or your leaders are too busy ducking to try to get anything accomplished.

If any board game played like Combat Mission, it sure is this one, though with fewer vehicles (which the rules for those are a bit wonky).

I&#039;ve been waiting for volume 2 forever!  I p500ed it right after I saw it announced.  Really excited about the changes in the system, and I think it&#039;ll be good.

Its supposedly coming with V3.0 of the rules too, which are supposed to clear up some of the issues still lingering (though I often just make a judgement call, or randomly determine things and go with it).

This is one of the most successful games I&#039;ve played - solitaire or otherwise - in terms of putting you into the mindset of what the game is simulating.  In this case, it&#039;s company command.  I like the fact that you need to concern yourself with things such as evacuating the wounded.

I played this with the v.1 rules out of the box, and though I had to flip through the rulebook a lot and make some judgment calls, I had no major problems.  I think gamers have different levels of tolerance for resolving ambiguous situations.  

My advice to new FoF gamers has been to bull your way through a mission, recognizing you will make mistakes, you will struggle with the rules and your men will suffer, and then re-start the mission for real.  This is not a game you can completely absorb just by reading the rule book over and over.  You have to wade in and get dirty.

I think [thing=68820][/thing] will be similar in this respect.

I have D-Day at Tarawa to get to yet and have CoH solitaire and Enemy Action: Ardennes coming, yet I have to try this one out too. I&#039;m actually OK that this is still a far way off. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll be enamored with the story it tells or find it too fiddly, but I&#039;m very curious to find out. 

Whether I start with the first European theater one or the new PTO one remains to be seen.

	<body>My purchase of this game is a direct result of reading all of the plays on SGOYT - gee thanks guys/gals :p

Picked this up from MM about two weeks ago and got it to the table last night. It was after midnight so it was technically 2/1. I played through the first Alien movie. Here is a brief report of the play.

Like most deck builders, your deck starts off slow due to the quality of your starting cards, but having your role card in there is a nice bump as that starts off as your most powerful card. Even though I had read through the rulebook once last week, it took me a bit to get the flow of game play down. Once I did though, which didn&#039;t take long, the game flows very quickly. There were situations I encountered early on (like revealing an egg that doesn&#039;t move) that I remembered reading in the rules and was 99% sure how to handle it, but was neurotic about finding the actual treatment in the rules to ensure that I was playing correctly. 

It was taking a while for me to complete the first objective, which had me slightly worried, but then both parts of the S.O.S. message came up right next to each other when I scanned and the first objective was complete. I got through the early game with only one enemy making it to the combat zone although I did take some strikes from the rough landing event. 

As my deck grew, those starting cards with their 1 Attack/Scan and 1 Recruit became annoying so Ripley&#039;s Quarantine cards came in handy there to weed out some of them. It took a while for the ventilation lock card to show up, but once I did, I was able to clear the ventilation shaft location and seal it off. On to the third objective.

I did have an alien make it to the combat zone and hang out there for a while (I forget the name, but it&#039;s the one that ends up costing 7 Attack if it makes it to the combat zone). I could never seem to get 7 Attack in my hand. I had six Attack a few times, but not seven. Luckily, I drew like two misses and another smaller wound. I finally killed that and was also able to wipe out two Facehuggers that resulted from eggs being revealed in the complex when an Event was revealed.

The airlock controls card showed up fairly early in the third hive deck cards so I had that ready and waiting. The Perfect Organism final enemy was the next to last card in the Hive deck. When it showed up, I was in pretty decent shape, having only three wounds. I had drawn the third Hazard earlier, which is the Self-Destruct. It was in the Airlock and I had the eight Recruit points in my hand to deactivate it, but Ripley&#039;s character card was in the HQ and I knew that I would probably need that to generate the 10 Attack and take out the final enemy. With only three wounds, I let the self-destruct go into the Combat Zone and took the three wounds. It was risky, but I hoped not to draw a double strike or anything that would hurt me too much. I ended up drawing five more points in wounds, which put me at eight total, but as the Gunner has 11 Health, I was okay. About two rounds after recruiting Ripley, I had to reshuffle and the Perfect Organism was closing in on me quickly. I got lucky and drew Ripley either one hand or two after shuffling it in and had the three Recruit points necessary to lure the Alien into the Airlock. Ripley&#039;s five Attack along with the three, two and one I had for a total of 11 were enough to take out the final enemy and win the game!

I really wanted to play more, but it was very late and I knew if I started another game, I&#039;d be watching the sunrise.

:thumbsup: Theme: this game is dripping with it like a salivating xenomorph :D I&#039;m a huge fan of the movies (I consider Aliens one of the best sci-fi movies ever made) and love the artwork, the flavor text, the names of the cards, and seeing all of the characters from the movies. Upper Deck did a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the movies.

:thumbsup: Good deck building mechanism. The class and crew abilities give you opportunities for combos that escalate as your deck grows. It&#039;s also important to have cards that allow you to &quot;kill&quot; some of your characters to get those weaker cards out of your deck as the game progresses.

:thumbsup: It&#039;s fun. I had a blast playing through the movie and really felt like I was playing out the story.



Both of my thumbs down are minor things. Overall, I loved this game and am so glad that you all compelled me to buy it ;)

:thumbsdown: Set up/clean up time. Getting all of those cards sorted and reorganized is kind of a pain, but that will get quicker now that I&#039;m more familiar with all of the different cards/decks. This card list:

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107161/1-page-card-list

put together by [user=gwarjuice][/user] is invaluable here. This game would be brutal to figure out the sorting without that file. If you buy this game, make sure to print it out and keep it handy. It makes life much easier.

:thumbsdown: I agree with much of what I have read that the scenario isn&#039;t all that difficult, but this is easily fixed by using variants others have posted. This isn&#039;t a big deal as I still felt a lot of tension while playing.

Overall, if you&#039;re a fan of the Alien saga and deck builders, you should take a look at this one. It&#039;s great fun!

The number of players makes a huge difference too.  I played solitaire and it was really easy.  Then me a three other friends played the same scenario and got overwhelmed.

	<body>First, a BIG shout-out to Chris...

[user=shacky22][/user]

...for his generosity as part of December&#039;s monthly &quot;challenge.&quot;  He offered to do some counter clipping for a lucky gamer, and that was me.  I received them back about two or three weeks ago and finally had a chance to play with my fancy looking counters.

Here is the BEFORE with all of the hanging chads, so to speak:

[ImageID=1971679medium]

And here is the AFTER...oooohhh, pretty:

[ImageID=2398775medium]

Thanks again, Chris.  [b]They&#039;re awesome![/b]

[hr]
[size=12][b][COLOR=#9900FF]Space Amoeba Solo Scenario[/COLOR][/b][/size]

Difficulty = Hard
[b]Result = Defeat, 11 Econs[/b]

For whatever reason, I don&#039;t see anyone really talk about the Space Amoeba scenario for this game, so I thought I&#039;d give it a try. It&#039;s quite fun!

I played on Hard difficulty, not because I thought I could actually win, but to help speed up the game overall. There are three unknown Space Amoebas out in deep space. You must discover them, then research them, and finally attack them before they consume everything...literally. They will swallow anything in its path.

Each hex containing an Amoeba will spread one further hex if it is not contained (with a Mine) or destroyed in combat. Each Amoeba has its own set of properties. In this play, Amoeba 1 had a strength of A7-2-2 and would allow a bonus attack to my ships if I used three different types. Amoeba 2 was a straight up D6-2-2. And Amoeba 3 was also an A7-2-2 but it had a weakness against Raiders.

[ImageID=2398777medium]

I felt my chances were pretty good for a while. But once those Amoebas begin to multiply, it doesn&#039;t take long before they reach the outer Colonies and you begin to lose CP. Less CP means less ships.

My main downfall was not focusing on the weaknesses of the Amoeba. I never got around to developing Cloaking tech, so I had no Raiders. And I really only built Cruisers for attacking.

I held off the Amoebas and had quite a few back-and-forth pushes of success. But, eventually, they were knocking on the door of my homeworld, Chulak. I made one last stand actually pushing Amoeba 2 back, but I only had two Colonies remaining. It was the end of the 11th Econ, and I would lose both of them in the next round, so I called it a defeat there.

[ImageID=2398778medium]

I could have fought them off for two more Econs, I believe, but without any CP to buy more ships, it would have been fruitless.

Overall...and to no surprise to me...another fun solo session of this awesome game. It&#039;s been almost a year since I last got it to the table. Hopefully, it won&#039;t be as long for the next one.

iOS?  Hope there&#039;s an android too.

Love the game, and I&#039;ve always wanted to try the amoeba scenario, sounds more fun than the DM scenario, which is kind of boring compared to multiplayer, which I LOVE.

I liked the DM scenario, but I think this might be more interesting.  There&#039;s definitely more to do.  As I said, you actually have to go out and find one of the Amoebas first...even though you know where they are.  Only then can you begin to research them.  You build Science Vessels (use the SW counters) and then send them into the Amoebas to study them.  Via die rolls, you have to gain 10 research points before you are allowed to attack them.

There are less deep space counters than in the other solo scenarios.  You only use your home counters, ten of the 10 Mineral counters, and four of the Barren Planet counters.  That&#039;s all.  So setup is a bit quicker too.

And since there is only one Amoeba counter in each hex, it seems easy to kill them...assuming you&#039;ve built your fleet properly.  But they multiply exponentially if you don&#039;t contain them, so one Econ, they are hanging around the outer reaches of the map, and two Econs later, they&#039;re encroaching into the center of your home space.

Very fun scenario.  I definitely say give it a try.

I like the Dm scenario, just compared to multiplayer it&#039;s a bit predictable and boring. 

This sounds different enough, though, to be pretty xool


I still need to try the alien ai player too.

I&#039;ve only played the Alien scenario once so far.  It does a pretty good job at simulating much of the multiplayer game.  There is a sense of the fog-of-war because you don&#039;t know what the Alien is sending your way until you engage it.  The bookkeeping is simplified for the Alien player too so, even though you need to track two sets of stuff, it isn&#039;t too bad.  And the flowchart from the Close Encounters expansion is very useful for playing against the Aliens.

I&#039;ll probably go back to that the next time I play a solo game of this, but I had fun with the Amoebas.

I played the Ameoba scenario two weeks ago.(Never got around to posting about it)
I played on Harder! difficulty to get the Ameobas in action fast. I think it was a cool experience and it developed into a standstill for me with one colony and the homeworld left. I called the game then as I saw no chance of winning and it would take some serious rolls for the Ameoba to win. 

[ImageID=2396319 medium]
Ameoba 3 was the weakest one with 1 hitpoint, so Sheldon and the Base there managed to hold that off for several turns. 
Ameoba 2 was the one you have to blow up a ship inside to kill. Dangerous one.
Ameoba 1 was stronger than Ameoba 3, with 2 hull points and an extra attack if it rolled 2 under the hit number. I managed to get Ameoba 1 to spread into the hexes occupied by Ameoba 2, so the 2 couldn&#039;t threaten Altair. 

With at least 30 CP&#039;s each turn I couldn&#039;t see myself losing anytime soon, and the AMeoba would need some seriously low rolls to take me out. 

The rule that you can chose which Ameoba spreads if two or more different Ameobas can spread there was what saved me. I used that rule to spread 1 as a barrier against 2. 
Had that spreading been randomized, I might have fallen to Ameoba 2.

I like this better than Doomsday, but it looks even more difficult than Doomsday.

Great game though.

I was using a die roll to determine which Amoeba and which direction it spread.  I figured I&#039;d let chance be its guide instead me.  Not sure it would have turned out any better, though.  :p

I&#039;ll do that next time. Another idea would be to establish a rank for the Amoebas to determine who spread.

	<body>[size=24][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

A few coincidences going around with this one. 

I got into solitaire gaming...... well, I got into boardgaming because in Jan 2012, RAB over at RockPaperShotgun said Mage Knight was his top game of 2011 and it can be played solo and, while it might be sad to play a boardgame by yourself, MK is just as fun as with 2,3, or 4. As this obliterated all my excuses of &quot;But you need friends to play boardgames with&quot;, I knew that I must find this game but it is OOP, so I decide to find other games to tide me over.

I dabbled a tiny bit in solitaire gaming over the next year while going through the highs and lows of the honeymoon phase of the hobby, finding and losing gaming groups and driving my new wife to hate boardgaming because of my overwhelming enthusiasm and blindly pushing her to always try new games. In Feb 2013, the ball drops and I realize I have noone to play with.

At the time, (first coincidence!) [thing=101785][/thing] caught my attention. [url=http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1538781_lg.jpg]It looked gorgeous[/url], it was solitaire, and it had some good reviews so I bought it. What it taught me was that, while the game was not for me, I enjoyed the experience of taking on a challenge by myself and realized I might be able to do something about this.

Mage Knight hadn&#039;t worked out for me so I ignored that but I started seeking greatest solitaire games of all time. One that came up was [thing=29603][/thing]. People were saying the AI was like playing a real opponent. As I loved the D-Day theme, it was a no-brainer...... but it was OOP. DG did have a P500 so I put myself on it then and there. The game arrived in May or June, I went through the arduous process of punching out those counters, bought plexiglass, read everything in the rules, printed out the flipbooks, and attempted Easy Fox twice over the next couple months.

My first GL item, I believe (July 2013, pretty early!)
[listitem=2711318][/listitem]

I decided to put the game aside while I master two DVG games, TAL and FC:Napoleon. Both are awesome. While I have gotten a few more plays out of both, it&#039;s nowhere near the amount I wanted. However, I did master the rules to both of them to the point I find both very straightforward, whereas at the time I had a lot to learn. 

DDaOB has sat on my shelf all this time. I know it&#039;s great but I wasn&#039;t in the [i]mood[/i] for it. Recently, I&#039;ve been getting more into a WW2 mood. Two months ago, klkitchens generously offered to clip the counters for my copy of this and the Reverend&#039;s copy of [thing=67600][/thing]. On Friday night, I finished the awesome book Killing Patton by Bill O&#039;Reilly/Martin Dugard and wanted to play it so badly. Unfortunately, my counters are in the mail being shipped back to me. Fortunately, I need to reread the rulebook anyhow so I&#039;ve started doing that and am loving it. Reading the historical booklet that comes with the game while having the game map laid out in front of you and seeing the actual history play out in my mind&#039;s eye that I will soon be able to interact with has all my systems twitching with anticipation!

So the second coincidence is I started reading the rulebook on Saturday for this game which also happens to be the first game I ever posted on a SGOYT geeklist!




Except...... the reason I thought that this was my first item was because I kept googling my name with this geeklist and seeing what came up. Sept 2013 did, Aug 2013 I apparently just added some comments, July 2013 yes, June 2013 - no. I figured that was it but then thought, why not check May? So I did. 

[listitem=2632442][/listitem]

Yup, I posted [thing=42673][/thing] as my first ever item. This community came together at exactly the right time for me, as I was searching for solitaire games starting in Feb/March of that year and prior to the geeklist, the wargamers really had the most comprehensive info on it (general Recommendations forum helped somewhat too. I didn&#039;t know about the 1P Guild nor did I even know that guilds existed on here). Had the list started earlier, when I still had hopes of finding real boardgaming enthusiast friends, I likely would have ignored them popping up on the front page. I don&#039;t consider myself a regular in the community until about September/October of 2013 when I started posting regularly. I didn&#039;t join the 1P guild until early 2014 because the GL alone was great!

Another big shout-out to the ever popular [user=reverendunclebastard][/user] for being an amazingly generous and giving man with his games, time, and support.</body>

Funny enough, I bought Mage Knight as one of my first modern board games, mainly because I could play it myself, and at the time I was living away from my wife in Gainesville while I started my Doc program.  Later found out it was cheaper to get a fuel efficient car and drive 200 miles a day four times a week than it was to pay rent (who would have figured).

I have several transgender friends. Knowing people who have struggled with this really opens your eyes to the constrictions and possibilities of gender. It also, unfortunately, opens your eyes to how bigoted and closed-minded some people can be. I firmly believe that we are all a bit weird lady and a bit weird man :D

It quite a moving song, pulls at the heart strings. 

I love where they play it again as a refrain/mottif when the kids give Mr Banks their tuppence and just before he is sacked from his job at the Bank in MP.

	<body>With Spring Training now less than 3 weeks away (February 18th, pitchers and catchers report), I thought I&#039;d get a head start and run a few games from my home brew fictional league.

:thumbsup: HMB does give you a great feel of a baseball game without the over-reliance on statistics that other baseball board games can have. Umpires can and will blow calls. Your AAA second baseman filling in can tear the cover off the ball for a few games then crash back to reality (remember Bo Hart of the Cardinals in 2003?). Do you bring out your all-star closer in a tight game against your rival even though he was lit up his last few outings? 

:thumbsup: Easy to understand mechanics with most results being of the &quot;If the pitcher is A then do this, else if the batter is B then do that otherwise do this 3rd thing.&quot; variety.

:thumbsdown: Some people have complained about the player cards being a bit on the small size and they are about 2/3 the size of a typical playing card, but the words and symbols on the cards are still rather easy to read.

If your a fan of sports games or even thinking about finding one you really should check out some of Keith Avallone other sports games on soccer, American (&amp; Canadian) football, hockey, lacrosse, stock car racing and even roller derby and Pro wrestling.

[thing=141067]History Maker Baseball[/thing] is my favorite baseball game.  The only problem I had with it was that it only comes with 2 teams and 1 set of manager cards in the base box.  But that&#039;s easily rectified with free downloads from the company site, even if you can&#039;t afford to or don&#039;t want to buy any extra player sets (but there are some really good player sets!)

I hadn&#039;t heard that people were complaining about the card size.  I like the small size of the cards and of the booklet.  It lets me play in a small space, and the footprint is even smaller if you only use one of the play mats and a scoresheet (the base-running mat isn&#039;t really necessary, and the charts on it can be found in the book or on the manager cards).

I think his brand of baseball will do really well there.

He won&#039;t be losing players due to budget concerns every year, so he&#039;ll be able to develop them and keep them.

This game just has never clicked for me. I could never get into a flow with so many checks per play (a typical play is dice, chart, card, chart, card, done).

Still, I just pulled it out again last week, wondering if I could rate some players by 2015 projections and play some games! I just cannot get enough of games that let you rate your own players.

I&#039;ve been working on a excel spreadsheet that allows you to plug in a players stats and it will automatically rate the players (That&#039;s how I created my 1900 set actually since there isn&#039;t a set for that season) Still have some kinks to work out with the fielding.

	<body>The Sentinels of the Multiverse Monthly Challenge train keeps on rolling!

Here were this week&#039;s rules:

Week 3: Cut off on head, two more shall rise and take its place!

Villain: Omnitron X

Environment: Insula Primalis

Heroes:

Everyone MUST use Tachyon. The random hero is: 1d10 = 9

VISONARY

rounds+ wounds+ # of devices with HP that come into play for ANY reason from Omnitron&#039;s deck or discard pile. 
So this would count any device he pulls from his discard pile, played by him, or played for any other way. 
It only counts devices with HP so it ignores any of his component cards.

....and my results...

I made Tempest my hero of choice this week, and it worked out very well.

[b]Time:[/b] 12 turns
 
[b]Wounds on Tempest:[/b] 10

[b]Wounds on Tachyon:[/b] 13

[b]Wounds on Visionary:[/b] 14

[b]Devices put into play:[/b] 10

[b]Total:[/b] 59

One of my best scores yet, and with some of the combinations available with this team, it&#039;s not hard to see why!  It also helped that Visionary got a [i]Twist the Ether[/i] out on Omnitron almost right away.  [i]Cleansing Downpour[/i] was a huge help (as always), but the MVP had to be [i]Reclaim From the Deep[/i] which allowed Tachyon to pull off four [i]Lightspeed Barrages[/i] in a row, and kept arming Visionary with [i]Precognition[/i]!  This is certainly a team I would use again!</body>

	<body>As this game does not come with solo rules (though I did not check for unofficial ones) and as I had to get down the rules, I played a three sided game over two of the three eras.

What an unusual take on Civ-building. The topological aspect of which tile to patch where adds a neat twist. Now you not only bid for a tile whose spaces will benefit you but also need to consider if you can patch it into your landscape. Water spaces, which cannot be patched over, and a grid limitation (5x5, 6x6, 7x7 in the three eras) had me moan more than once.

As it was a learning game, I did not concentrate on the victory points one can get per vote on achievement tiles after each era. Usually each player has three of those and you would surely have your strategy influenced by this. 

I found my action space lacking a bit. The number of actions you can perform each turn is determined by your politics rating. Two players stayed at 2-3 politics for the majority of the game. This really limits what you could do each turn, as there are not so many 1 point actions to chose. 

Hope I can play it multiplayer some time as I really want to explore the game further.

--------------------------------------------

Update 7/2/15:

Played it again three sided today and made it through all three eras (only took me the whole afternoon, interrupted for 1.5 hours when family turned up).

Interesting aspects:
- even when I had more politics points for more actions, I sometimes chose to save them all for votes as those could turn 1:1 into victory points. This was the case when I did not have better rates for victory points.
- the patching is awesome and painful. Especially in era 2 did I feel pain in the patching, era 3 did not feel as harsh
- the player with highest military did win in th end. But not due to wars or too extensive skirmishes. He had Tesla as a hero, granting 5 Victory points for every building built through an action. He tried to focus on this, resulting app 20 of the final 119 VP.
- all players did follow different strategies. One managed to hoard money for a whopping 24 VP at games end for a final 110 VP
- the third player was unable to build a good engine/combo and only managed 91 VP in the end.

I REALLY want to play it multiplayer now!! :D

I&#039;d heard of this one before but didn&#039;t know anything about it.   It looks pretty neat, and that system of overlapping (patching) the tiles is really cool.

Too bad there aren&#039;t any solo rules, but even so this seems worth a look.

It is a different take on Civ-building - the auction and patching drive the game a little more than the political actions you have each round, imo. Thus it feels quite different to my favorite CIV-Game [thing=25613][/thing] or others, where you drive your Civilization ahead through your actions. I needed a slightly different way of thinking and not let myself get sidetracked through nice civ-stuff. You want to earn victory points. And if your best chance is in earning them trough an and of era scoring where currently only you get to score, then you want to hoard votes instead of taking any political actions. 

Though usually you would get a better ratio of Political Points to Victory Points than plain 1:1. My players yesterday had the following options through actions and/or heroes. 
- an aggression against a 2nd player: 3 PP : 4 VP (+2 for you and -2 for him) or 3:8 (if your military is far superior, which it was)
- building stuff: 1 PP + 2 Resources (potentially another PP for a conversion) : 5 VP --&gt; this was a great combo of a 1st era hero and a 3rd era hero. Nothing you could really plan for.
- reclaiming land: 2 PP + 1 Resource : 3 VP (through a world wonder)

Will most likely not solo it again multihanded as it just takes too long (for me). But am really curious to play it against two or three opponents - hopefully in April this year.

	<body>Hello!

Seeing all those plays of this game here in the lists reminded me that it has been far too long since I last played this. So, I finally put it on the table.

Of course, I went for bacterial - and got a really lousy start. A1 was the E molecule as was one of the molecules on the B-circle. Okay, so I figured starting with E was a good idea. Next thing I know, the outer E molecule got replaced (^_^;;

Adding to this, early on (first or second turn, I think), an H molecule got placed on the C-circle. I still got lucky with the containment rolls, so I had the time to get those proteins - only to have the H molecule replaced on the turn where I could have finished the antidote. Not sure what to do (it had been a while), I finished the H antidote (big mistake).

During the mid game, I was able to get some good funds by creating effective antidotes. And after the rather annoying start, the mutation rate went down. I was early epidemic when only one molecule was left. Marvin was available for purchase, but I didn&#039;t want to sacrifice for that.

Thus, I continued and 3 or 4 turns later, I was still in early epidemic, I was able to destroy the last molecule.

[b]Likes[/b]
+ Fast and good fun
+ Lots of story in it
+ Lots of randomness in it

[b]Dislikes[/b]
- The puzzle game board is a bit loose/tends to fall apart during play
- Some of the artwork is not that good (although the picture on the box is the one I like the least)

	<body>Not the origin story, but a playing again of my origin story game. 

So I picked up the first BattleQuest dungeon, which uses one character, Baroness Ancella&#039;s Crypt. I used Karin &amp; Jaeger, and went to battle with a Healing Stone (trinket, ante to gain 1 life, cycles with discards), Steel Armor (40hp instead of 20), and Limit Breaker (allows you to use your finisher attack) with Red Moon Rage. 

I smashed through the first two rooms (zombies and imps) but missed clearing the third room (dark wisps) in time so I had to take the harder route through the game. 

A room with Dual Werewolves nearly ran out my timer (I limit each level to 15 beats or else I get way too discouraged and am likely in over my head, so I restart it if I go past 15 beats) and ran me down to 12 life out of 40. Ouch. 

The putrid room, with two zombies and an ooze, is much harder to deal with than the easy path&#039;s ooze room, since the zombies keep moving and taking hits meant for the ooze. 

I died with 5 damage on the ooze. 

I&#039;m getting the hang of playing Karin &amp; Jaeger, but it still takes me a couple of turns to position Jaegar such that Karin can start thumping the heck out of opponents. The werewolves are always hard, however, especially when there are two of them. They move around far too much. But once you whittle them down to one werewolf, you need to keep it stunned before it regenerates and gets +6 power against you. 

The ooze is just annoying with zombies. Always try to take the easier path, folks. Unless you&#039;re into the challenge, of course, that dual werewolves and oozes + zombies make. I tend to find getting down to the Baroness to be more important, because she is something of a challenge. 

I used customized standees so it was all more thematic. I think I&#039;ll need to add numbers to the standees and create a battle mat so that damage can be more easily tracked for multiple monsters. 

[imageid=2399157 medium]

Well, damage and power-ups in the case of the werewolves.

I still really like this game as much as I did before, but the dungeons have a wearing effect on me. I like quick, short battles when I play this game, thus playing against the python AI feels more pleasing than the gradual attrition of the dungeon, even though each level resets the beats etc (though not your life). 

I need to clear the ottoman and get Viticulture on it, and get Agricola onto the dining table... and once the upper bedroom has had its contents junked away, I&#039;ll set up another table up there (along with my game shelves) and have a third game out for solo play, probably Fields of Arle, my last big game purchase for... quite some time. 

[b]Edit:[/b] Just realized that if I arrange things right, I can have a table in the other spare bedroom for games. Need to get some big plastic tubs so stuff can be stored in the closet instead of on the floor.</body>

Nice! This is only my third play of this fine, Euro specimen of harvesting and selling veggies, and I scored my first &quot;Good&quot; level at 17 (0).

I planted Pumpkins to start as two Regulars were in the offering needing them. However, Turnips (although, they look like Radishes to me) were the bread winners this session with three Regulars and a couple of Casual customers needing them over the long haul.

Speaking of which, Casual customers were scarce this time around. I didn&#039;t see any until after the reshuffle, and even then only four made an appearance. I delivered to three of them, letting the first of the bunch pass me by as I didn&#039;t have what he wanted.

[ImageID=2399302medium]

I feel my &quot;big&quot; move this game was going from 10 to 13 on the score track after a particularly productive turn. On the final round of play, I saw I was one dollar short of making 17, but with a lone Pumpkin sitting in the cart, I sold it back to my Market for $1 giving me just enough to get the magic mark for my first time.

Maybe Pumpkins were the right way to go after all. ;)

I have both and they are quite different games. Loyang is quite a struggle to meet your customers needs while dealing with the random card availability, there is constant pressure and you always seem to be one coin short of being able advance that extra space up the track. Arle is a big giant sandbox with less pressure and way more open choices; it is fun to try different strategies and see what the outcome is. 

I didn&#039;t have any Euros in my collection, so I started with Loyang. However, that quickly led me to pick up Arle, and now I am eyeing Glass Road. Be careful, Loyang is a gateway Euro (or at least a gateway to Uwe)!

Loyang and Glass Road have the most bang for your buck, though Arle offers a cool laid back atmosphere. 

I think I&#039;d be able to play Loyang 100 times easily, though

Yeah, I know once I pick one up, it&#039;s just a matter of time before another one of his games will make it&#039;s way into my collection. At this point it&#039;s just a matter of which one I go for first:D

	<body>[size=24][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

This was my first posting on [listitem=2727261]SGOYT[/listitem] way back in July 2013. I actually got this for my birthday (July 2). It wasn&#039;t my first solo play as I&#039;d been getting in to more solo play over the past few months. I actually joined BGG on the last day of 2012 looking to download Todd Sanders&#039; [thing=86003][/thing] and learn more about my new [thing=124708][/thing]. 
I forget how I discovered SGOYT but I joined the 1 Player Guild shortly after and the rest, as they say, is history! :meeple:

Anyhow, as part of Stig&#039;s [listitem=3710910]challenge[/listitem] I played this today and scored a 57. I didn&#039;t get all 7 cities built until after round 6 and got the architecture development and a bunch of other cheap ones and just the pyramid and the wall monuments. 

It&#039;s still a fun short filler. I enjoy the yahtzee mechanic because I get to have some level of control over the outcomes. I&#039;m not as much of a filler player anymore though since I have got into games like Loyang. When I bought Loyang I bought [thing=150926][/thing]. It cost more than Loyang which was used though in excellent condition and has a box that is twice the size of RTtA and also was about twice the cost, for not much more in the box (though I bought RTtA on Amazon the cost differential is still huge) and the gameplay does have some changes, but it really feels like just about the same game to me. I know it&#039;s not quite, but there&#039;s not enough different in it to get me excited. Especially if it&#039;s just a big, expensive filler. </body>

Thanks for the comments re: The Iron Age.  I&#039;ve been thinking about picking it up, but keep holding off because it doesn&#039;t look that different than Bronze Age.  Glad to know my fears are confirmed, and thanks for saving me some $$.

I should clarify that others do think it&#039;s different enough and offers more. It seemed like variations on a theme to me, and while that can be new and cool and fresh it didn&#039;t click with me. Though, I should play it some more.

	<body>I will continue this month with my [b][geeklist=183720]Eldritch Horror Solo Challenge[/geeklist][/b]. I won&#039;t be posting here on those sessions. You can subscribe to the geeklist if you want to follow along.

Yesterday I received my copy of [b][thing=163602][/thing][/b]. After some thorough research and the first (video) reviews appearing, I was pulled off the fence to get it.

I played the Tutorial and didn&#039;t get very far: At the end of Round Three two Continents were in Panic and I lost the game. It&#039;s too early to tell what I really think, especially because I&#039;m still internalizing the rules. They&#039;re not difficult, just some wording is a bit odd here and there. I don&#039;t mind that the rules are in the app, which is brilliant in its design and presentation.

The solo game is excellent. You have a bit more time, more than I expected, to step through the Timed Phase. Playing some Rounds during the Tutorial also taught me how I can better organize the components. I can get rid of the Reserve cards (except the Squad Leader&#039;s). I left the Role Summary cards out anyway.

What I will do next time is group all the components necessary for the Timed Phase and keep them closeby, and leave the Resolution Phase cards seperate. When playing solo, the individual roles really don&#039;t matter, it&#039;s having everything at hand when you need it.

Other than the app, [b][thing=163602]XCOM[/thing][/b] is a typically tight FFG design with stunning components and artwork. The gameplay strategy has yet to fully show itself, as I become more comfortable with the rules, the cards and abilities, and so on. This will only take a session or two more, I suspect, as I delve more and more into how to approach what the game throws at me. I can see the glimmer of greatness, and will report on further sessions as I play them.</body>

Zombicide is a game I bought, played once or twice then traded away. After watching a few playthroughs and having binged on The Walking a Dead show and comics, I wanted to revisit the Zombie boardgame genre.

I preordered[thing=150376][/thing] as I think it captures the interpersonal conflicts among the Survivors. However, there seems to be a log jam somewhere as copies haven&#039;t made their way to my favorite local online store.
I owned and played [thing=29368][/thing] and it captured the cheesy quality if the 70s and 80s flicks but it only really shines when you&#039;ve got a Zombie master vs the survivors. Not a fully satisfying solitaire experience.

I found myself returning to [thing=113924][/thing]. I found a used copy of the original set and soon after got [thing=161866][/thing]. I also acquired [thing=137987][/thing] but that still remains unplayed.

:thumbsup: Fun! If you&#039;re looking for a game that let&#039;s you vent your frustrations on a horde of undead, Zombicide is your game. There&#039;s also a puzzle element as you have a limited set if actions. Use them wisely.
:thumbsup: Each base set is self-contained. You get a great gaming experience with just the base set (no real need for expansions). I recommend getting Rue Morgue. (I ve played Season 1 and 3 but haven&#039;t played Season 2). Rue Morgue has more survivors (twelve vs Season 1&#039;s six)a better rulebook and a few more extra rules (crawlers, helicopter, team cards, triggers, camp and hospital tiles) to give the game some extra chrome.
:thumbsup: Excellent miniatures. Good quality plastic and nice sculpts. I&#039;ve seen some great painters work their magic on these minis. You don&#039;t really need to paint the figures if you don&#039;t want to. I just don&#039;t have the time and talent for painting.
:thumbsup: Plenty of missions
:thumbsup: Missions are challenging.
:thumbsdown: Some missions are horribly imbalanced. But then again Zombie Apocalypses are hardly fair. Plenty of other missions to enjoy though.
:thumbsup: Expansions Galore!
:thumbsdown: Expansions Galore! Completionists will have to spend a lot to keep up.

I have S2 Prison Outbreak, plus the map tiles from S1 and some extra zombies, dog companions and special guest boxes of heroes. This game is a real blast. Trying to resist the urge to run out and get Rue Morgue when it arrives soon.

	<body>Finally got all my cards made and sat down to play this. It was fun. However, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be getting it out very often. Mechanistically it&#039;s quite interesting and that&#039;s actually partly why I made it, as an educational experience. I like how he does it all with multi-function cards and you get the sense of exploration. 
However, the purpose of the game is to get some items and beat the bad guy. Which is fine, but as I look at the boss battle, it&#039;s nearly impossible given the game mechanics unless you have played an otherwise perfect game and gotten all the other special items. So, that puts me off. Still, it was worth the time and effort to experience it. It may come out periodically, but not too often I think. </body>

For me, [thing=34639][/thing] is the very best of the games using this system. The art has a bit more weight behind it than Adventure of D, and there&#039;s a bit more to do than in Island. You can certainly see how things evolve, as you work through them.  Excellent travel companions, too.

Plus you can actually have minor wins and an actual score in Dungeon of D. Survive a couple of levels, feel that your resources have run out? Duck out through the mystic portal the next time you find it, and chalk up your score and do better next time. 

Island of D 2 is like a little solo filler; Dungeon of D is what has the meat.

	<body>Decided to have a D6 Dice Fest tonight, so looked thru the PnPs I have which use normal D6&#039;s.

Scored a 239 - a respectable, but not great, score based on previous attempts.  
One day I may get round to working out Gold/Silver/Bronze thresh-hold.</body>

239 is my lifetime best.  Hit it during vacation a few years back.  Pole Vault is what makes or breaks my score.

	<body>[b][i]2of4 D6 Games.[/b][/i]The layout didn&#039;t seem too bad, with an advance HQ on the starting row, 4 steps away.  So early rounds occupied the helpful Sea tile, advanced the HQ to the half way point, and occupied both a field and forest ready to attack.  

By this time the Lord of Cubes had deployed 5 armies.  

The next couple of rounds were attacks reducing the Cubes armies by 2, but the (single) HQ was also down to Strength 2 and the sea dice was down to Strength 3, so used the Sea to re-roll the HQ... (several times) only to get 2 - 1 - 1.

I needed the Lord of Cubes to deploy a new army, so the field could feed all the other Dice and buy time for another attack... however the Lord of Cubes instead rolled for an already occupied tile and so removed the last point from the HQ.</body>

The treasure chest contained an Ancient Staff for the Wizard, which helped him take out the Giant in 2 rounds using a fire ball and level 6 chain lightning.  However the Giant did manage to deal 4 damage.

Whilst fighting the Skeletons, the Cleric attempted - and failed - to heal the party.  With the Cleric limiting the dice the party only managed to kill 2 skeletons, whilst the skeletons were hitting hard and wiped out the party in 2 rounds.</body>

	<body>[b][i]4of4 D6 Games.[/b][/i] Easy Level game, with the minimum recommend 4 Zombies to hunt.  An odd game tonight, each round I took the maximum hunting party (2x Zombies), and only lost an infection check once.

Also, by rolling above average number of Heroes and not pushing my luck, managed to quickly reduce the Zombies to 1.  However the last Zombie just wouldn&#039;t die and kept biting a hunter.  

This started a rinse-&amp;-repeat cycle.

Eventually a hunter got lucky and killed the last Zombie. (Final score 27).

Update 4 Feb:  
An erratic week, minimal gaming time so only playing fillers.  Hopefuilly the weekend will change that, anyway;

5 more games - and just for giggles started with [b]10[/b] Zombies.
[i][b]Game 1 &amp; 2 - Scores 17 &amp; 16.[/b][/i]
Infections were rare.  Hunting parties were Hero heavy capturing and killing 6-7 Zombies during each game. 
[i][b]Games 3 &amp; 4  - Scores 10 &amp; 12.[/b][/i]
Infections were common,  rolling 1 Hero was considered a good hunt - and the Zombies were starting to bite back.
[i][b]Game 5 - Score 11.[/b][/i]
Hunters could only catch infections &amp; Zombies were biting HARD.  Game only lasted 3 rounds!
At this point dice were dropping [i]Zebedee[/i] hints, so took their advice.

:thumbsup: Simple PnP filler.
:thumbsdown: As with all dice games, luck-central.</body>

	<body>Have really been getting my money&#039;s worth out of this one, this weekend. After the walkover of the previous report, I decided to try my hand against new villain, Ithaqua, bringing Daisy Walker and Finn Edwards to the snowball fight. 

Note to self: invest in some chuffing Focus tokens!

I must&#039;ve played my way through every hypothermia condition, this game, whist staggering between bad debts, leg injuries caused by the non-payment of such, wounds getting infected and then poisoning me... and a dose of good old-fashioned paranoia too (which resulted in Daisy violently attacking her allies and driving them away; librarians, it seems, don&#039;t play well with others). Saw some horrific stacks of monsters, as every mythos offered a gate burst - and an accursed omen symbol. For the first time, the doom track was chased down to zero... I ran out of Mythos cards and so had a single chance to win, with Finn attacking with everything he had. 

I guess frostbite interferes with the smooth rolling of the dice. 

A loss then, but one of the most nail-biting games I&#039;ve yet played. If, like me, you were thinking you didn&#039;t need this if you owned Arkham Horror, you might very well want to look more closely. This game is a bit of a masterpiece.

	<body>[size=18][b]Origin Story[/b][/size]
Circa 2008ish. I was still married with 4 children and living in Alaska at this time. I used to play games with the kids on the weekends, Heroscape was a much played game. The wife was never really into board games. She would play once in a while. She got tired of me and found someone else. I deployed to Iraq for a one year vacation. I come back from Iraq and the kids have &quot;decided&quot; that they want nothing to o with me. Here starts my solitaire odyssey. I have games and no one to play with. I then start to look for games on the geek with made for solitaire, there aren&#039;t that many. I think my first two purchases are Pandemic and Roads &amp; Boats.

Now the Army says its time to go to Missouri. So I do what any good soldier does, pack my crap and go. There really was no game scene in Missouri so solitaire was my only way to play. Over the next three years my collection slowly grows. Then the army says time to go to Kentucky, so I pack my crap and go to Kentucky. It is during this time that I discover [user=shacky22][/user] and his solitaire tracking geeklist. Looks like a good idea so I copy it and make my own (I don&#039;t keep up with it anymore).

Then the SGoyT and the 1 Player guild pop onto the radar. I joined the 1 player guild in November 2012. I believe I am member #43. My first post to the SGoyT was in June 2013 and it was Duel of Ages. I still own it and it is on my table as I type.

The SGoyT has cost me a lot of $$. But it is worth it. This is a great community and really the only thing I check out on the Geek.

Here is my current game in progress:

:thumbsup: I love the mash up of themes.
:thumbsup: Unique stories develop every game. No two games will ever be the same
:thumbsdown: Not a solitaire game due to lots of hidden info and bluffing.
:thumbsdown: No solitaire variant</body>

I love Duel of Ages as well. There&#039;s actually a solo puzzle version here: 

[thread=1108140][/thread]

For DoA what I like to do is take an index card for each character and write down their goals, then try to achieve those goals with only what they know (noted as well on the card in shorthand). This keeps the world view of each character close enough that opposing-handed solo games are exciting still. 

The goals may change as the game changes, so pencil is handy. :D Afterwards, I have story fragments from each character&#039;s point of view, which I can later stitch together into a session report, such as this: [thread=1009612][/thread]

Hm. I may do this again some time after I get a couple tables set up on the second floor for solo games.

I finished my play of this.

[b]Team White[/b]
Robin Hood
Camden Drake - Sloth &amp; Discipline (Lith/Test)
Napoleon - Faithful Hound &quot;Little Sparky&quot; (Henchman)
Greymede - (Forgot to draw his starting cards...oops)

[b]Team Black [/b]
The Weinstein Bros. - Bengal Tiger (A fricken Tiger!), Old Jonah, Slayer Extract
Annie Oakley -  Griswold Rebel Revolver (Gunz!)
Milena Arrebato
Smoke - Henry .44 (More gunz!)

[b]Platters[/b]
The glade
crags
Madras stronghold

[u]White strategy[/u]
The glade was chosen because of Robin Hood and Napoleons ability to move through difficult terrain. I forgot to draw Greymede&#039;s starting cards until I started writing this but the initial plan was to link him with Drake (he was the only character with high enough 5+ honor. Napoleon would hit the colonial labyrinth. Drake would try for the future labyrinth. Robin would go ancient. White base had Dismissal cube and Rifle Scope (whatever).

[u]Black strategy[/u]
The Weinstein&#039;s had Tyson&#039;s tiger and they wanted to set him free. Annie had her gun and the plan was to link up with Smoke and trade for the Henry .44. Milena would adventure. Black base had nageyari and Stonewall the mule. Stonewall wasn&#039;t the least bit happy with his accommodations. He kicked and bit anyone that came close. The plan was to put any prisoners in with the ornery mule.

[b][u]You see what had happened was[/u][/b]
Napoleon got off to a quick start setting little sparky loose and succesfully adventuring, pickning up a 9mm Parabellum and water splitter. Later on both of these were traded to Drake. This was the highlight of team white (sad but true). Little sparky did manage to bite Annie Oakley once and then spent the rest of his time pissing on fire hydrants and licking his balls. Robin Hood snuck around in the woods sniffing flowers andd hugging trees. Greymede deployed so late he really didn&#039;t do anything except avoid being eaten by the tiger (the fricken tiger!).

Team Black had luck on their side. Annie had a pistol and Smoke had the rifle and the both put them to good use. The Weinsteins let the tiger (the fricken tiger!) loose on Greymede who was then chased into the white base. Annie shot up Robin Hood. Smoke clmbed up on a mesa and picked off Drake, who up until that time had successfully avoided Smoke by using the water splitter to traverse a creek, with the Henry .44. It was shot of legend, one shot, one kill. Milena brushed her hair. The Annie-Smoke gun exchange never happened. Team Black was victorious.

I have 2 things to say.  That stuff where wife and kids abandon you, that sucks and I&#039;m sorry you went through it.  Also, thank you for your service.  You&#039;ve taken some hard knocks, and you&#039;ve given back. :thumbsup:  Also, maybe as the kids get older they will see things differently; at least stay available to them.

I learned a lot about myself, and people from all this. That whole situation could have destroyed me. I chose to let it make me a better person.

From the photo above, the implementation doesn&#039;t seem to have changed so I won&#039;t be giving it a reprise, but I&#039;m really glad you like it. I nearly did.

Actually, apparently a lot has changed, the ratings are different, the way they are contested, the adventures have been cleaned up, the phases, too.

From what I can tell there&#039;s not one huge change but almost everything has been cleaned up and tweaked. So it won&#039;t be worth looking at if you didn&#039;t like the core, but if you liked the core but elements of the execution were keeping you away you may want to look at the reviews. I believe Tom Vasel has a video in DoA2 page comparing the editions, too.

Either way, thanks for the comments :)

I know that the first edition was Tom&#039;s number one game for years, that was why I originally got it. But it wasn&#039;t long before I found out that my gaming tastes were much closer to Sam Healey&#039;s than Tom Vassal&#039;s :D

I have zero in common with Zee&#039;s tastes :D

The comparison video sounds cool, I will check it out.

The platter board left me cold, it lacks the focus of the Mage Knight tiles for me. DoA (an unfortunate acronym) reminded me of the layout of a game I had in the eighties called [thing=828][/thing], another interesting game which suffered the same problem for me.

Richard,
I am really enjoying playing this solo but can&#039;t help think how much better it would be against other people.

Phil,
I find the equipment decks interesting as well. Every time I draw a new card it&#039;s like a surprise. Sometimes you draw something that you think is crap and it turns out to be pretty good. You just have to figure out the best use of it. In the play above when I drew the water splitter I was disappointed. I thought it was worthless, but Drake managed to use it to cross some water and avoid getting shot by Smoke, only to later get shot and killed by Smoke!

Anyway, Phil, I get that not every game is for everyone. I feel like that about [thing=39683][/thing] and [thing=42673][/thing].

	<body>Recommending this as a great PnP prompted me to break it out for another play. Very quick to set up and play, and a lot of fun. Very easy PnP to make, just 18 cards (will need a bunch of cubes and some d6 too).

The goal of the game is to last three turns of four rounds without too many locations being overrun. I played on easy, so I lose the game if 5 locations have 8 or more invading units on them at the end of any round.

[imageid=2399591 medium]

One card is combat tables, one card is for tracking Manna, Spirit and Turn Number. Four of the cards make the board (two locations per card). The remaining 12 cards are drawn 3 at a time to determine various things for each turn.

[imageid=2399592 medium]

The black shield numbers are added together and this is the number of units added to each of the locations listed at the top of the first two cards. If there is a &quot;location or location&quot; choice at the top of the card, the units are added to the location with the fewest units. The blue circle numbers are added together and this total is added to your current manna. The red circle numbers are combined and the total is added to the defending units defense value on the combat chart. Each turn you can use one spell (printed on the top, coloured stripe) by spending manna, and one special action (printed on the white stripe near the bottom) by spending spirit.

Each turn you draw/execute three cards then move 1-3 spaces clockwise around the board, then roll dice to attack the invading units on the square you land on. Results are found on a combat chart. If you win, some invading units are removed, if you lose, you lose spirit.

Here is how my game went.

Start of Turn One:

[imageid=2399601 medium]

End of Turn One:

[imageid=2399602 medium]

End of Turn Two:

[imageid=2399603 medium]

End of Turn Three:

For an animated GIF of the whole game, try here:

With the Square, Gate and Barracks overrun this was a victory on easy (lose if 5 or more locations overrun)! Medium difficulty you lose if 4 or more locations are overrun at the end of any round, Hard difficulty you lose if 3 or more locations are overrun. 

:thumbsup: Fun and quick to play but with a modest amount of depth. 
:thumbsup: Like all Todd Sanders designs, it is attractive to look at.
:thumbsup: Only 18 cards to PnP.
:thumbsdown: Nothing I can think of, unless you hate filler games.</body>

I really love this game. It quickly creeping into Friday as my go-to quick game.</body>

I agree...especially with some of the new expansions in the 2nd edition.  Isn&#039;t the theme great?  So creepy, but so cool.

	<body>Journey down the Anduin is a frustrating beast. I don&#039;t really see how you win if you don&#039;t get a good draw for that initial hill troll. I suppose my last game was just really bad luck as even with a 3 threat cushion, I couldn&#039;t get any dang cards.

Ugh... trolls.

[b]Update:[/b] Two long attempts today. First was derailed by forgetting two encounter cards in the 2nd stage.

Second was derailed by not forgetting.

Ugh. I&#039;m getting better though. :ninja:</body>

I just purchased this and am playing with 1 copy of the core set and currently with the rec. decks.  I&#039;ve played the first quest twice with the leadership quest and I still haven&#039;t beaten it. First game got land locked with about 2 enemies and 3-4 lands, there was no way I could quest enough even committing gandalfs 4 to lower the staging threat.  The second game went through the whole encounter deck, by the end i had 5 enemies engaged with me with the 10 quest 3b quest card.

I know people like to work through with the monosphere decks, but you have fewer cards and while you maximize the sphere synergies, you lose some of the others. If you feel you&#039;re beating your head against the wall, I&#039;d recommend:

	<body>Tried this again, trying to not re-do my mistakes from the last time I played it (my first game). 

My biggest mistake last time is that I tried to sacrifice lives to get rid of bad fighting cards. I did that too well took aging cards too fast, so I didn&#039;t last through yellow. I did better this time -- I made it to the second red fight and drew five cards and all of them were zeroes. :gulp: I didn&#039;t have enough lives left.

I like this game a lot and I&#039;m starting to form a strategy:

Green is to get rid of the weak cards. This is tricky, because if get rid of too many you will age too quickly.

Yellow is to gather up as many fighting cards as you can 

If you did Yellow correctly, you won&#039;t have too much cards to fight on Red. Then you have a chance against the :arrrh:

It&#039;s easy to talk about the strategy, but a completely different think to put it in play. :whistle:

[b]EDIT[/b]

All this talk made me want to play again. ;)

I did better this time -- I ran with the idea of adding &quot;+1 life&quot; and &quot;+2 life&quot; to the bottom of the deck. ;) I went to Red with 16 life left and came away from Red without a lot of losses.

I beat the first pirate ship, not without trouble, but using combos helped a lot (I had a lot of +2 cards on that). But the last pirate ship was &quot;Fight against all remaining hazard cards&quot; and I just couldn&#039;t get 55 points out of the 20 or so cards I was allowed. :(

	<body>[size=18][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

HeroQuest is my gaming origin story, and I&#039;ve still got it on my shelf, 22 years later.  As for Solitaire Games...

[q]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? [/q]
3 months ago, I was searching suggestions for solitaire games and somehow linked into this geeklist.  

[q]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/q]
Shadows of Brimstone.  Sure do.  Almost done painting it!

[q]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/q]
The overwhelming positive vibe.  People actually enjoying playing and talking with each other about games!

[b]I find it very amusing that the friendliest, most socially well-adjusted place on BGG is a guild for people who enjoy playing games alone.[/b]
:D

[q]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/q]
There was a guy with a Cookie Monster avatar (chris leko).  He has since switched to a grumpy fish.  You should switch back.  CM4EVR :cool:

[q]What keeps bringing you back?[/q]
No one bickers about what makes a &quot;legitimate&quot; review!
The highest regarded people here are esteemed for their friendliness!
[u][i]It almost feels like a pre-internet hobby club.[/i][/u]

[q]How much money have these lists cost you?[/q]
So far: Thunderbolt Apache Leader, Mage Knight, and the final expansion for Pathfinder (wasn&#039;t going to pick it up because my original Pathfinder partner moved away and I&#039;d lost interest.)</body>

	<body>Played Core Worlds, base game only, using the SoloPlay rules, in preparation for the tutorial.

I managed to beat the easy-level AI at long last by two points, which is actually game victory. If I had beaten it by another point, it would have been major victory. 

The SoloPlay version of Core Worlds is definitely thinky. The spatial movement makes for an interesting puzzle, and the fact that it&#039;s seeded from card draws adds enough randomness for me. The rest is trying to outsmart the AI, and sometimes catch rides on it. I had to pull out every stop and pull no punches to get that almost-major victory. 

And of course if I had been playing on normal mode the AI would have nearly blown me away. 

It&#039;s a most excellent solo variant. 

[b]UPDATE Feb 4[/b] 

I blew away the AI this game, with Galactic Orders, 32 points to 14. Even if the AI was on hard mode, it would have scored at most 11 more points, or 25. It was a combination (as always) of luck and hard play, particularly since I manipulated things such that the AI would never take high-scoring worlds (defined as 5+ VP straight up) if there was anything I could do about it. Once I had a hand full of nice units and a board full of high VP planets about to expire, so I just shopped for units so the board would clear. 

Entirely worth it. 

I really do like the addition of Galactic Orders, although I feel that events are poorly integrated into the SoloPlay variant somehow. Somehow. </body>

[q=&quot;davekuhns&quot;]Is the SoloPlay variant similar to the multiplayer? Because apparently I need another space game.[/q]
Yes and no.  I mean I haven&#039;t actually played this against anyone else, but it&#039;s one of those multiplayer solitaire style of games.  Yes, you can invade a World or buy a Unit that someone else wanted, but you are mostly focusing on your own fleet and you own goals.

So, with that in mind, yes it&#039;s similar.  You need to build up your fleet to accomplish the goals you want just like in the multiplayer version.

The difference is the spacial aspect of the &quot;universe&quot; instead of just a basic &quot;market&quot; in the standard game.  It costs you Energy (one of the currencies of the game) to move.  In the standard game, there is no movement.  That&#039;s a major difference.

Then, depending on your action, the AI will have a set reaction.  So, basically, you can program your turn at the beginning of each one based upon what you are going to do and how the AI will react.  And that&#039;s where your success or failure will come.

If you can manipulate the AI into a less than optimal play [b]and[/b] accomplish your goal at the same time...Bingo!

As Ava said, it&#039;s very thinky if you want to play it that way.  You can certainly just fly by the seat of your pants each turn and see how it plays out, but your level of success will certainly suffer.

AI menaced me the whole way though. I had to sacrifice at least two good hands of units to keep it from scoring overly much. It made me sad not to be able to play the Great Brain because I&#039;ve never used that card before, but better safe than really, really sorry.

	<body>After a few months on the shelf, I&#039;m breaking out one of my favorite deck builders.  Legendary plays quick and has a lot of re-playibility due to the different combinations of bad guys and schemes.  I enjoy finding how the different heroes interact with each other and the fantastic artwork that makes me feel this I&#039;m in a truly epic battle.

I purchased this to play with my son and friend (who is a comic book junky.) They felt it was repetitive, solitaire-ish, and dragged at times, with no real fear of losing.  I too felt this early on, but think the expansions have solved this problem.

When playing solo, there are some compromises.  You only get three heroes and sometimes HQ bogs down since cards don&#039;t cycle as often with more players.  Additionally, there are some combinations of mastermind/schemes that are either to easy or impossibly hard to beat playing solo.  As I play more, I&#039;m starting to recognize these combinations and can adjust appropriately.  As a side note, I always play the 1 player advance rules and use a randomizer to pick the decks. 

:thumbsup: Fantastic artwork and theme.  Schemes make me feel like I&#039;m part of an epic story.
:thumbsup: Lots of re-playibility and plays fast solo.

:thumbsdown: There are scheme/mastermind combinations that are either too easy or too difficult to beat solo.
:thumbsdown: There are times when the game stalls.  This most often happens when you can readily handle the villain deck, but just can&#039;t seem to get enough attack to take down the mastermind.</body>

I played this for the first time this weekend. It was a multi-player game (I know, I know). It felt like playing Dominion with a super hero theme, which isn&#039;t bad because I like Dominion. I really like the ability to combo the cards but for a first time player it was a lot to take in.

Question (rhetorical...maybe): Do I really need this if I already have [thing=102652][/thing]?

[q=&quot;gregor1863&quot;]When playing solo, there are some compromises. You only get three heroes and sometimes HQ bogs down since cards don&#039;t cycle as often with more players. Additionally, there are some combinations of mastermind/schemes that are either to easy or impossibly hard to beat playing solo. As I play more, I&#039;m starting to recognize these combinations and can adjust appropriately. As a side note, I always play the 1 player advance rules and use a randomizer to pick the decks.[/q]

I just played it the first time last week...[listitem=3709573]here are my thoughts[/listitem] if you&#039;re interested...and thought it worked quite well.  It was only one specific setup though, so I&#039;d like to try it out with a few more before making a final call on how well it works.  But so far, it seems promising.

You use the standard 2P setup, so you get to play with five heroes which is nice.

Different games mechanically.  Theme is still very present in Sentinels, so if you&#039;re a die hard comic junky you could get both, yet have different playing experiences.

Sentinels didn&#039;t stick for me, although with all the expansions I&#039;m hoping to give it another whirl at a con this year.

Been thinking about getting this to perhaps play with the kids. The 11 yr old know Dominion and she and the 5yr old (yeah a little young) love Marvel heroes.

The idea of a solo variant makes me want to dust off my wallet. Or try in a Math Trade, which is what I would probably do first.

	<body>[size=18][b]Origin Story[/b][/size]

My solo gaming life started with my dad&#039;s 1960&#039;s version of Stra-o-matic baseball when I was 10. I played league schedules and completed something like fifteen solo seasons of 52 games before Dungeons and Dragons became the social game of choice.

Twenty years pass and I stumble into a podcast called the Dice Tower and during one of the podcasts he mentions BGG and I go running to the computer to look for it. I start looking for solo games but the choices are limited until I find the PnP section where I discover D-day Dice. A year ago or so I found this list and it&#039;s been a whirlwind of solo game discovery, great people sharing their experiences and some great laughs.

Therefore, it is fitting that my orgin story be posted along with a new &quot;baseball&quot; acquisition [thing=151022][/thing]. This landed on my doorstep this weekend and I was excited to get it to the table right away. This by no means a baseball game but more an abstraction of the mechanics of scoring in baseball. I found the rule book was okay but because my mind wanted to see strat-o-matic baseball so I watched some short clips on how to play the game. I was up and running with confidence in less than 30 minutes. 

The gameplay is fast and the mini-games are short. In between the mini-games you get to deck build by drafting new players to enhance your team. The automated AI which is made of superior players and is random but still challenging. I found that each mini-game was full of decisions and surprises.  [imageid=2399813]

I was able to beat the AI 4-2 in a best of seven series but each game was close and I see that the strength of the AI is based on which 15 random cards are picked...but it was still a challenge and I was lucky this time. Each mini-game takes about as long as a Dungeon Roll delve and the set up is pretty minimal with a medium size footprint. This will be my go to relaxing game during baseball season after a long crazy day at work or to play with my kids. My nine year old picked it up fairly fast so I&#039;d say it&#039;s an easy learn with plenty of medium stress level choices. Home Run!

:thumbsup: It&#039;s Baseball... Fast baseball...WHAT!???
:thumbsdown: rule book could of had a little better sample game with just a few more examples of play. 
:thumbsdown:i finally resolve to slow down on my acquisitions and now the kickstarters start rolling in. The next thing I know I turned around and bought Imperial Assault...so I guess shelf space is my last barrier to full on game hoarding but who cares right? Gaming life right now is the best!

Strat-O-Matic is awesome.  I bought my brother-in-law the 2013 version for his birthday and I plan on breaking out my copy of 2004 in honor of Spring Training starting next week.  Played basic rules last year and I plan on moving up to advanced rules this year.

I ordered this last year, with all teams.  I had it as a kid, and somehow, my inner child came out and overtook my wallet.

What I used to do is set up a standard tournament bracket (AL on one side, NL on the other)...used to use &quot;Easy rules&quot;, and would play all weekend to see who would pull out the tourney win. 

Naturally, what was the first thing I did when my copy came in?  

I, of course, do not have as much time as I did as a 12-year old might have, so I have only worked through &quot;round 1&quot; of my 2014-2015 bracket challenge, so far.  

That being said, the Nationals are looking pretty strong.

That&#039;s why I play Out of the Park Baseball for my computer. I can do a season in a few hours if I aim the games and only act as manager or general manager. If I actually coach the games, the  it takes a while. But I can set pretty in depth strategies and tactics for my manager to use. 

The beat part is how easy it is to make leagues. You can create a fictional league and then sim it for like 30 years and pick a team and go.

	<body>ORIGIN STORY

After playing Mage Knight and enjoying it very much, I started looking for more solo games. BGG design always confuses me but I managed to find the geeklist &quot;The definitive list of solo games&quot;, from there I found my way to SGOYT. That was 5-6 months ago and I have been following SGOYT ever since.

However, this is my first entry. I got Ottoman Sunset a few months ago. It was my first state of siege game. I really like the concept. It is simple and elegant.

My playthrough this time started quite nicely with German U-boats protecting the straits, thus blocking the British assault on the straits. I usually lose to that. So, I was comfortable and hoping that I would get an easy victory. Unfortunately, constant advances by the enemy on all fronts and a few defeats in battles drove my national will below -3 which cost me the game.

A few days ago I ordered bunch of VPG games, including the Hapsburg Eclipse. Apparently, you can combine both games. I am excited!

:thumbsup:  Very easy to set-up, takes very little space and plays quickly.

:thumbsup: Good story-telling if you are interested in the theme. It is even possible to arrange the cards in numerical order which allows you to play the events of this period in chronological order.

:thumbsdown: Everything ultimately comes down to die rolls. Some might not like that.</body>

	<body>Once again using the SoloPlay rules. I would have scored better had I stopped earlier and left more than 0 unused track, I think, but I might not have been able to. 

6-8 points is an easy game victory (I scored 8 points), 9-11 points (which I feel was achievable) would have been a normal game victory. 

I did play on hard mode (because I always forget some of the special leniency rules for the first destination), so there&#039;s that. Maybe I can just mentally add a point for that, and have a game victory; on the other hand, I used the &quot;Flat Lands&quot; layout, so that probably balances out.  

[b]EDIT:[/b] I achieved normal game victory! I forgot to add 2 points for 3 complex routes, so 10 points. I am happy now. 

Ah, a pretty map, though an inefficient network in the end: 

[imageid=2399881 medium]

I finished far more destinations than usual. I wish I could have made it to 28 destinations, but I only made it to 22, and 6 more would have been more or less impossible with the amount of track I had left. 

I think I can improve, and the variant is teaching me about efficient networks, certainly. There are places I could have zigged when I instead zagged. 

All in all, a very fun variant once you understand set-up. I need to prepare a player aid and probably a tutorial video as well, at some point in time. </body>

	<body>Been trying the solo game out in this recently, and it&#039;s a pretty nice, quick little version.  Not quite as fun as the multiplayer game, but still the fact they included effectively 3 extra coasters (2 AI coasters + one side of one of the research coasters) in the box JUST for solo play makes me very impressed and so I feel obliged to play it solo as often as possible. :)

So, to the ratings:
:thumbsup: Solo game built into the game &amp; rules, and it works nicely.
:thumbsup: Beautiful production quality!
:thumbsdown: Solo game isn&#039;t as fun as multiplayer.
:thumbsdown: Would liked to have seen variant rules for using BOTH solo AI coasters in a solo game. You can probably work out a way to do this quite easily, but there are no specific rules to say how.</body>

I&#039;ve been liking this too since I got it at Christmas.

Quick to play, simple but challenging AI and different routes to victory (or defeat) in most games.

For the money and size it plays well.

Using both AIs would be good.

I can&#039;t compare it to multiplayer though as I&#039;m solo only.

Just tried playing against both AIs. Worked very well, much the same as playing against just 1. I lost quite quickly though, after Saccharine Inc got BOTH the Feature Blend and Rainbow Blend and just rocketed to the win.  Maybe using the 3 player scoring was just too much... ;)

Game end:

I printed off some simple scoring sheets for the solo bots to avoid having to use the scorepads. :)

Very interesting.

Maybe ignore the rule that the AI can have both type of blends to give it some balance or as you&#039;ve hinted just use the 2 player scoring or maybe both.

They still get their re-rolls or extra flavour dice and they can still roll 5 dice after breaking up a blend.

In fact, I&#039;m going to try it the next time I set up and play.

Yes, that sounds like it would balance things nicely.  I think it was the combination of Saccharine Inc getting both blends (including a 5-yellow feature blend so was hard to steal), and hanging on to them for about 3 rounds, that really clinched it for it.  Had I been able to steal the rainbow blend from Saccharine on the last roll, &quot;we&quot; would have had a couple more rounds, but as soon as it was its turn, it got the 1 point for still having the rainbow blend and won.  You can see from the pic, TransGlobal (who was rolling REALLY poorly I might add ;)) managed to steal the feature blend from it on its last turn, but it wasn&#039;t enough. :)

I&#039;ll also try out both these tweaked rules and see how it plays.  Will report back!

I&#039;ve also found that the AI getting the Rainbow Blend is a killer. If you go for the feature blend it can still knock you off whilst earning 1 pt a game.

I try to capture the rainbow blend every chance I get.

I&#039;ll report back here too.  Even though I do really like this game already, I&#039;m even more excited to play it.

Well, I tried it out with both tweaks - that is, solo coasters are only allowed one of either Rainbow or Featured Blend, and using 2-player scoring rules.

The game was a LOT closer, and I enjoyed it more.  End score was:
- Me: 18
- TransGlobal: 15
- Sacchar, Inc: 21

If I had had one more turn, and rolled just 2 whites, I could have finished the research track of white, scored 3 points, and got the win.  Very close, so a lot more satisfying and experience.

Will give it a few more goes like this, but I much prefer it this way.

EDIT: Sacchar won it by keeping hold of the Rainbow blend for over half the game, the cunning swine.  And TransGlobal was rolling very poorly yet again, even with 4 rerolls!

OK. 3 games of this last night against both AI&#039;s.

The first one on normal level using the 3 player scoring and not allowing the AI to control both blends. Lost. Sacchar 21, Omniblend 12, Me 11. Sacchar did seem to run away with it. The extra point for a featured blend really pulled them away.

Next I tried it with 2 player scoring. Lost again. Sacchar 21, Omniblend 15, Me 14.  This stayed closer for longer but eventually those extra flavour dice rolled a big blend and we were doomed.

Tried it again on easy. Won this time. Me 21, Sacchar 16, Omniblend 14. Again it stayed close for longer. I won but it felt about the same difficulty as the standard solo easy game.

This does need continued testing but so far I think 2 player scoring, AI&#039;s can only have one blend and the &#039;Hack the Brew&#039; power affects both AI&#039;s when played (I only used it on one but I think 2 would make it more useful) is the way to go against 2 AI&#039;s.

Definitely a fun way to play it solo.

[q=&quot;njshaw2&quot;]Well, I tried it out with both tweaks - that is, solo coasters are only allowed one of either Rainbow or Featured Blend, and using 2-player scoring rules.

The game was a LOT closer, and I enjoyed it more.  End score was:
- Me: 18
- TransGlobal: 15
- Sacchar, Inc: 21

If I had had one more turn, and rolled just 2 whites, I could have finished the research track of white, scored 3 points, and got the win.  Very close, so a lot more satisfying and experience.

Will give it a few more goes like this, but I much prefer it this way.

EDIT: Sacchar won it by keeping hold of the Rainbow blend for over half the game, the cunning swine.  And TransGlobal was rolling very poorly yet again, even with 4 rerolls![/q]

You must have been typing this whilst I typed mine.  Sounds like you had a good experience too.

A few more plays needed but it seems like it works well and keeps the game close.

Agreed, and I do like the idea of Hack the Brew affecting BOTH AIs.  Nice idea there.  I&#039;ll continue testing.  I may add this as a variant to the game&#039;s page, once I&#039;ve tried this last tweak...

You should add it. I went over there to check if someone had done something along these lines but nothing so far.  Spread the word.

I&#039;m glad you had the idea. This is a great way to play it solo and doesn&#039;t add complexity to the game. Thanks.

Ya know I thought about backing it on KS and then decided not to. It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve heard good things about a game I didn&#039;t decide to back.

	<body>It&#039;s my birthday in a couple of days so I picked up this game as a present to myself! I was torn between this and Omaha. I settled on this title for two reasons: firstly, I played a couple of games of [thing=105023]Fleet Commander Nimitz[/thing] in January so was in a Pacific theatre mood; secondly, this appealed slightly more as it represents the entire assault whereas Omaha is obviously just one beach in a larger battle.

Finished my first game yesterday but now know that I got a couple of rules wrong, particularly regarding Japanese activation. For the first couple of turns I wasn&#039;t activating units with depth markers when there was only a single symbol on the card, and I was activating tanks based on the colour of the position they were on and not the colour on the tank. And I got myself a little confused with Position Groups.

So I&#039;m launching straight into another game - hopefully this time with everything straight in my head. I considering the first game as a training exercise!

I was very, very impressed with the system. It plays quite quickly once you get to grips with it, and it creates some really exciting and tense game play. The first couple of turns before any HQs are landed are massively entertaining as you agonise over your meager 3 actions. Thank goodness for Major Ryan!

I can see me coming back to this a lot. It&#039;s certainly piqued my curiosity about the upcoming [thing=67601]D-Day at Peleliu[/thing]. </body>

And my deepest respect if you play it exactly &quot;by the book&quot; with your second attempt. It&#039;s full of subtilties, especially regarding the Japanese actions. 

Let us know about the overcomes of the second play, please.

I want this game, but I&#039;m trying to ignore it as I shouldn&#039;t spend the money and don&#039;t have the time currently.

It&#039;s okay but definitely has some flaws. Despite the theme, which I&#039;m really interested in, it isn&#039;t a patch on Field Commander Napoleon in my book. I&#039;m comfortable with the level of abstraction in the Commander series. While weird things can happen in Napoleon, with single enemy units getting entangled with the entire French army, it is a rarer occurrence than Nimitz, and because of the command and control restrictions of 18th/19th century warfare there were occasions of forces doing stupid things. A lone Japanese carrier taking on the might of the US Navy is a little too jarring for me.

I can still see myself playing Nimitz when I&#039;m in the right mood, but Napoleon will be my go-to game for this series.

Tarawa, of course, is in an entirely different league and I&#039;m already very must impressed with it!

Thanks for sharing your thoughts. FC Nimitz was a total bomb for me, the first game from DVG that I just can&#039;t stand. I wrote a lot about it in last month&#039;s SGoYT and so won&#039;t repeat it here.

While I have read a lot of comments similar to your own regarding the quality of Nappy over FC Nimitz, I feel burned enough by FC Nimitz that I have no interest in any of the Field Commander titles anymore.

Now DDaT on the other hand, I am quite interested in!

	<body>[u][b]Session 1: SoloPlay - Game Victory (+1)[/b][/u]

[b]Me (Priam): 45[/b]
Units/Tactics/Worlds: 13
Core Worlds: 15
Prestige: 6
Faction Tokens: 11

[b]AI: 44[/b]
Energy: 11
Units/Tactics/Worlds: 16
Core Worlds: 7
Prestige: 3
Faction Tokens: 7

This was my first experience with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/97578/soloplay-coreworlds-v1pdf]SoloPlay variant[/url] by BGG user GamesRuleforOne, andâ¦wow.  That was just about all he could say: wow.

I had heard good reports from the SGoYT geek list, but I was still skeptical, thinking that it would end up being too fiddly and non-intuitive.  I was quite pleasantly surprised to find that the mechanics are not that onerous and the design of the variant is actually quite thematic.

This SoloPlay variant also solves a lurking issue with Core Worlds that there is a single, dominant strategy: spend the first couple of rounds deploying the base units into the war zone, then leave them there for the entire game in order to streamline the deck down to just a single hand which recycles over and over.  This has the advantage of getting Energy Surge cards into one&#039;s hand every round, while also setting them up to get +2 energy instead of just +1 because opponents will likely have conquered an additional world or two, thus increasing their base energy production.  And with the addition of the Galactic Orders, cycling through units/tactics with order icons leads to many more tokens on the various order tiles and thus, more flexibility and more scoring.  Opinions vary on whether or not this strategy is actually dominant over possible alternatives, but it is very effective regardless.

The SoloPlay variant addresses the issue neatly by adding the maintenance cost of 1 energy for every set of three units over the initial three in a war zone.  Thus, 1-3 units in a war zone is maintenance free, but units 4-6 cost 1 energy per turn, while having 7-9 units would cost 2 energy per round.  Thus, it can be ruinous to maintain a large war zone over several rounds, rendering the strategy of deploying all the basic units and just leaving them unused for the entire game untenable.  This is particularly true in this variant in which energy is used for movement as well as drafting, deploying and conquering.  But even without this additional use for energy, I think the maintenance idea is a good one.  It is not so great as to be game-changing, but it does create some balance.  In multiplayer, imposing a cost, even a minor one like this, would force players to use their war zone units more often instead of making it a glorified dumping ground for undesirable cards.  And it is even thematic: maintaining a large military force in a state of immediate readiness should be expensive in any context.  Real militaries don&#039;t stay constantly at high alert 24/7 just waiting to be sent into action at a moment&#039;s notice.

I know that the spectre of war zone maintenance kept me on my toes in this solo session.  Energy was in such short supply for the first part of the game that I could not have afforded much extra.  That said, once the AI gets its own energy production going, then maintaining a large war zone becomes a bit easier since the Energy Surge cards are doubled in effectiveness.  But this is perhaps as it should be: your empire has grown, after all, and you should by the mid-game have a decent energy economy running.

As far as this specific session went, I was not sure what I was doing for the first few rounds.  It took me awhile to figure out how the AI moved and how much it cost me to move, etc.  I rapidly figured out that I needed to plan a few moves ahead, taking the various AI reactions into account.  I liked how the variant lets you &quot;ride along&quot; with the AI marker, saving energy.  It adds a nice element to planning; I was always thinking about how I could manipulate the AI into going where I wanted so I could move without spending energy and still get the cards I wanted.  This didn&#039;t always work out though, and I even found myself having to &quot;borrow&quot; energy from the center at times.

I finally developed a bit of plan.  I had drafted two units with the Mystic Brotherhood icon, so I had a few tokens on that order tile when the Divine Energy tactics card turned up.  I immediately recognized that this represented a huge advantage for me if I could draft it into my deck.  I had to do some tricky maneuvering around the AI and spent nearly all my energy moving my token into position to draft it.  Once I had it, however, I was able to use it repeatedly for big energy boosts.  It&#039;s almost absurd that playing the card not only gives +1 energy for every token on the Brotherhood tile, but that it also adds another [i]which counts as one for the additional energy[/i]!  Since my deck was relatively streamlined at this point, I built up a large supply of tokens on the Mystic Brotherhood, several of which I was able to spend to draw additional cards.  This meant quicker deck cycling and seeing Divine Energy more often -- a powerful positive feedback loop which I rode to success in the latter rounds.

It was a good thing I did, however; I obviously needed every single energy point I could muster to eke out the one-point victory.  I also saved energy by spending most of the game riding along with the AI token.

I did help out the AI&#039;s score a bit in ways I hope to avoid in future sessions.  I finished two rounds with actions and energy left, which earned the AI energy points.  I also did not take advantage of the mechanism whereby using a token on an order tile allows removal of an AI token.  I therefore probably let the AI have 6 or 7 points I could have prevented with smarter play.

I look forward to playing this variant again.  It has revitalized the game for me. I had despaired of ever getting it to the table again multiplayer.  The lengthy play time means it is really only good for 2-3 players and while I found that folks were favorably inclined toward the game, they tended to gravitate toward others when offered the opportunity to play.  While the forthcoming iPad app will hopefully provide asynchronous play with online opponents, this excellent SoloPlay variant will keep my physical copy of the game hitting the table on a regular basis.



[b][u]Session 2: SoloPlay - Complete Victory (+6)[/u][/b]

[b]Me (Menelaus): 40[/b]
Worlds: 7
Units (Worldship): 9
Tactics: 0
Core Worlds (Ra, Indra): 16
Factions: 8 

[b]AI: 34[/b]
Energy: 8
Worlds: 12
Units: 1
Tactics: 0
Core Worlds (Zeus, Buono): 11
Factions: 2

This session featured lower scores than my first, but a more comfortable margin of victory.  I was better about keeping the AI from grabbing cards with energy tokens.

I tried deploying a lot of grunts/snubs at first and leaving them out to clear the deck; I wanted to see if the maintenance requirement would hurt.  And indeed it did.  This early in the game, every unit of energy is precious and losing one to maintain a 4-5 unit war zone limited options to a surprising extent.  Part of the problem was that Energy Surges are only half as effective if the AI is not generating more energy than you.  Since they don&#039;t start with a home world, it takes them several invasions to catch up and pass the player and make the Energy Surges effective.  Thus, keeping a big war zone full of starting units does not work nearly as well in this SoloPlay variant as it does in multiplayer.

I wasn&#039;t able to hitch a ride with the AI nearly as often in this session as I was in my previous.  This left me forced to spend more energy to move where I needed to go, although I avoided taking any loans this time.  That said, I had to get creative in two rounds to make sure I zeroed out energy or actions to keep the AI from getting a &quot;free&quot; action.

I didn&#039;t generate nearly as many faction order tokens as I had in my previous sessions.  The cards I picked up were not as useful or easy to deploy.  And I found myself having to spend a few over the course of the game to keep turns from stalling out for various reasons.  But the AI didn&#039;t get as many either, so this evened out.

I got ahead of the AI decisively in faction tokens in sector 5.  The event was Warlords, which makes every player remove two faction tokens from faction tiles.  I let it fire on turn 9, removing two of mine and two of the AIs.  But I was able to arrange it so that the AI did not acquire a card with a faction symbol for the final two rounds while I deployed several units and used a couple of tactics cards which earned me order tokens.  On round 10, I paid two energy to negate the event.  The net effect was that I gained some points on faction order tokens relative to the AI.

Still, my victory was entirely dependent on the Worldship which I was able to leave deployed at the end of the game.  This 9 points was decisive; without it, I&#039;d have been defeated by three points.  I was able to draft and deploy this expensive unit thanks to two tactics cards, one of which gave me discount of 3 energy when drafting, and one which gave a discount of 4 when deploying.

This session played out differently than my first, primarily because the cards on offer were different.  There is a huge amount of replayability given that you only see, at most, 12 cards from each sector deck.  You have to think tactically and go with what you&#039;re given to work with in terms of unit mix and faction icons.

I&#039;m looking forward to future plays and have made Core Worlds the last game on my &quot;10x5&quot; solo challenge.</body>

Nice one, Marc!  Way to squeak out the win on your first attempt.  Now that you have the AI reactions down, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have greater success.  I&#039;m happy to see this one popping up more and more with the SoloPlay variant.

And I too hope the app has async play as I&#039;d love to get in a game with a few of my solo gamer friends.  I didn&#039;t back the KS but will definitely look to purchase it soon after its release.

Indeed, the SoloPlay variant is more thematic than the regular game in my opinion.  The addition of a spatial element gives a fun sense of maneuvering a fleet around the galaxy looking for opportunities to strike.  It definitely makes the game a bit more thinky, but in a good way as far as I&#039;m concerned.

I don&#039;t play this game and don&#039;t have a dog in the fight, but out of curiosity to the design, would this maintenance cost mechanism work in the regular game as well and address that issue?

I hope so, because that dominant strategy doesn&#039;t sound like much fun. 

Because of the energy maintenance cost of a large army of non-robots and non-heroes, I tended to value robots and heroes over infantry, vehicles, starfighters, etc. Capital ships and star cruisers are still important, of course, but they are worth it. 

I also learned to be far more selective of planets I wanted to take over (and not just because of the AI) so I would only deploy what I needed. Plus the fact that the AI invades a planet whenever you deploy units (to prepare for invading a planet on your own) means that choppy deployment (deployment that isn&#039;t done as part of one turn) screws you over severely.

	<body>I kept reading about people on the SGoyT geeklist playing this game so I finally broke down and bought it. Can I say I am addicted. I love heavy long drawn out games, which I why I am a solitaire gamer. (My wife like games just not Epic games.) Due to the family situation I cannot get the the heavy games out very often. Friday is a great game for when I have only a small amount of time to play and not a large footprint to play it in.


:thumbsup: Easy setup and game play
:thumbsdown: Losing in the yellow round

	<body>Played the Scenario that linked the first 5 together into the full raid.

Things did not go well.  Mohne dam had four mines drop on it, only one doing damage, and only one point at that (even after getting the flak down to 0!), a Nightfighter scattered 4 back to base, but only 1 showed back up at Scampton!.  The diversion at the next dam went alright, the mine was dropped perfectly and did a sizeable amount of damage, but only one plane wasn&#039;t going to take the thing down.  The Sorpe with the remaining 3 planes got bombed successfully by 2 of the 3 planes...but did not do enough damage to take it down.  Seems I pulled all of the 1/2 Upkeeps...On their way home, one of them didn&#039;t make it back.  The final plane attacked the Sorpe again and botched the final roll even with a +7.:(

So in the end, no dam was breached, and only 4 planes returned.  Wallis wasn&#039;t allowed back, and all the missing pilots were killed over Germany.

I hope my luck is better as I add the flight rules.

:thumbsup: Creates a compelling story
:thumbsdown: Really just a big push your luck game with few big choices (at this point)
:thumbsdown: Can seem repetitive even with the slight changes between the different dams. </body>

More choices start to show up in the flight section of the game, but where the real tough choices arrive is in the planning phase of the full campaign. The dam attacks are definitely all about push your luck, but the decisions you make in the planning phase set the stage for all your later choices.

I&#039;m at the exact same place as you, combining the first 5 scenarios. I&#039;ve heard, as the Reverend mentioned, that the flight path adds much more, and ultimately the first 9 scenarios are basically playthroughs until you get to the campaign in scenario 10.

I&#039;m excited to continue on with it. This has been one of the best surprise purchases I&#039;ve made.

I, too, am looking forward to adding things to the game.  All the historical accuracy really adds to the game, and the &quot;look&quot; of everything certainly enhances what is, so far, a very simple game.

I&#039;m planning on getting back to this after I finish my Nuts! Campaign.  It doesn&#039;t look like the Flight section makes anything more complex (just makes more choices of pushing your luck on the mishaps or not), so it should be easy to jump into.

The flight section is fairly straightforward and easy to jump into. The choices are subtle but interesting. How you structure your waves can be key, as well as choosing when to join and leave waves.

	<body>[b][size=18]My Super Solo Sunday[/size][/b]

My wife and I were sick on Super Sunday, which sucks because I live within walking distance of the Cardinalâs stadium, and we didnât get to go over there and take in all the free concerts and super bowl pre-game to-doings.  But we werenât so down and out as to not make it a Super Sunday of board gaming. Wellâ¦ I wasnât so down and out anyway. Just after I set up [thing=142084]Kings of Israel[/thing] for a two player game, my wife bowed out and went back to bed. Although it may have something to do with me not having read the rules beforehand, and she didnât have the time or the patients to deal with my fumbling through yet another rule book. Needless to say, Feb 1st became a Super Solo Sunday for me.

[b]Kings of Israel[/b] 
After a quick reading of the rules followed up with a Rahdo Runs Through, I was ready to take on the struggles, plights, and various Kings of Israel. This being the first time I played the game, the usually first time mistakes happened. The mistakes I made were not with rules, but with shuffling. This is one game where an ill shuffled deck is death. 

The sin and punishment deck had all âBrimstone and Fireâ in the top 7 cards (two were one after the other). That in itself caused insurmountable odds to overcome, but the other poorly shuffled deck was the Resources deck. All wood cards were together at the bottom which meant I could not build any altars. I lost many turns doing nothing but turning over resource cards with both prophets. 

Half-way through I decided to switch to the easy version (gain a blessing card after sacrificing at the altar) which did little to help since there was only one altar on the board. Both my prophets were huddled together around the altar at Samaria searching desperately for wood and gaining blessings that only prolonged the inevitable. 

In the end we were overcome with three destroyed cities (Jericho ironically being the first to go) and everyone worshiping Baal (who apparently is the god of âwoodâ). In a secular way, I can chalk this one up to not setting up the game properly. But the theological side of me wonders how this relates to the spiritual. Surely God helps those in need (Isaiah 25:4), but perhaps Ben Franklin was right in that God helps those that help themselves. Or, at the very least, God helps those that bother to give their decks a good shuffling (Luke 14:28). 

Breakdown:
:thumbsup:[size=9]Quick and easy setup.[/size]
:thumbsup:[size=9]Excellent for fans of Pandemic.[/size]
:thumbsdown:[size=9]For such a large deck, âBlessingsâ are hardly ever used (unless I missed something).[/size]
:thumbsdown:[size=9]Needed rule clarifications occasionally.[/size] :thumbsup:[size=9]Designer is very active in the forums and answers all questions clearly! [/size]

[b]Imperial Settlers[/b]
Next up was [thing=154203]Imperial Settlers[/thing]. I got this one primarily for solo play, but chose it in case the wife woke up and felt like joining me. She did not. The game was met with equaling disaster as with Kings of Israel due to my own buffoonery. This time, I choose the wrong deck to play. I started with the Barbarians but accidentally used the Egyptian deck. The sad thing is that I did not notice the error until I was cleaning up after the game. Maybe I was sicker than I was letting on. As far as anyone reading this is concerned, I will go with that as the only plausible excu- erâ¦ explanation. The whole time I was struggling to get things built. In the end, because of a lucky pull of attack cards, I wound up tying with the AI. Alas, in this game a tie is still a loss. 

Breakdown:
:thumbsup::thumbsdown:Lots of bits (fun to have bits but affects setup and breakdown).
:thumbsup:Lots to do on your turn. Success is based on how well you optimize what all you can do.
:thumbsdown:Table real-estate shrinks dramatically the better you do (if you donât have much space, then try not to do so well).
:thumbsup:Rulebook explained everything.

[b]Well, at least someone other than me lost today[/b]
I decided to cut my losses and turn to the television where a surprisingly good game was breaking out (albeit with two teams I care nothing about). The game, dubbed by friends as the Jerks versus the Cheats, ended with the Cheats winning (a lesson that every solo gamer ponders the spiritual ramifications of). However, what may appear to have been divine intervention on the part of the Patriots, was obviously none other than Pete Carroll playing with all his running play cards at the bottom of his deck.

Breakdown:
:thumbsdown:Patriots won
:thumbsup:Seahawks lost</body>

	<body>[b]Origin Story? Well, let me tell ya...[/b]

I discovered wargaming in high school, and fueled by lots of history reading (not to mention reruns of &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;12 O&#039;Clock High&quot;, and especially &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;)I became as passionate a gamer as my budget would allow. My brother and I played or I&#039;d play solo: Games like &quot;Panzer Blitz&quot;, &quot;Tobruk&quot;, &quot;Richtofen&#039;s War&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, &quot;Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, and &quot;Air Force&quot; became our passions. 

But then, as the story goes, Real Life Arrived. 

University, dating, marriage, work, family. Games were just part of regular family life, so as the kids came we&#039;d cycle through Hi Ho Cherry-O, Go Fish, The Match Game, Candyland, The Game of Life, Boggle, and so on. There were a few times my daughter and I played AH&#039;s History of the World, but no one else had the patience for games that were challenges rather than pastimes. 

But then the kids were off to college and my wife went back for more classes as well. And one fateful day in February 2010, on a whim searching for &quot;wargames&quot;, I came across Winterfest Wargamers...and found that their annual week long monster game fest started TOMORROW exactly TWO MILES from my house. So I showed up, and the rest is, as they say, history. 

I found a great group of guys from all over the region, but I also found box after box of the most incredible games. Unbelievable variety and subject matter and...OMG. 

For the first three years after that I tried to play some of the classic solitaire board wargames but nothing really caught on with me. Since this summer I&#039;ve gotten deeper and deeper into the hobby, and when I re-discovered BGG this fall it seems like everything&#039;s clicked. And I&#039;ve gone big time into solitaire gaming, mostly with games not specifically designed to be solitaire. 

While I joined the Solitaire Guild earlier, I&#039;ve only dug into the SGOYT in the last few weeks. And here I am...with another game play to talk about!




_______________





Historically the Battle of Trebia (or Trebbia, I&#039;ve seen it both ways) occurred in the Second Punic War, when two Legions of Romans let by an overconfident Consul Sepronius forded a winter river and attacked some guy named Hannibal. Little did the Sempronius know that this Hannibal guy had concealed a force (led by Mago) in a ravine to the Roman rear, and kept it hidden until just the right time for its maximum impact. The resulting victory was a stunning Carthaginian success and further established Hannibal&#039;s reputation as one of the greatest generals of all time. 


[ImageID=2398130medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]The real Battle of Trebia River looked like this. Very few Romans made it home at all.[/i][/COLOR]



In Command and Colors this attacking force enters the board from behind the Roman army with the use of a Leadership card, and deciding when and how to have this force strike makes the scenario one of the most interesting in the base game. The force is strong enough to mop up weakened Romans, but if they enter too early and are faced with heavy resistance Mago&#039;s Carthaginians will be wiped out themselves. On the other hand, wait too late and Mago could arrive on a battle field already lost. 

So the starting position looks fairly good for the Legions, though closer analysis would give the advantage to Hannibal&#039;s forces even without Mago. Hannibal wants to wear down enough of the Roman medium and heavy infantry so that Mago can roll through several partially destroyed units with his two units of Warriors and one of Medium Cavalry. Without such Roman attrition this force is not enough to even safely fight their way through to friendly lines, much less win the battle for the Carthaginians.

[ImageID=2397299medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]Starting positions. I like to think that the situation looked dark for the Romans (so I don&#039;t have to face the fact that the picture is underexposed)[/i][/COLOR]

In my game the Carthaginians started with three Leadership cards so they would have the ability to choose how and when they wanted to bring Mago across. They decided to work carefully, and as the Romans advanced the Carthaginians focused on ranged fire to whittle down some key units. They did manage to almost eliminate the Medium unit the Roman leader was attached to, but they couldn&#039;t finish the deal so when the medium unit advanced it was able to both give morale boost and participate in close combat if it desired. 


[ImageID=2398454medium]


When the Romans played a &quot;Double Time&quot; card they were able to close with the Carthaginian line unexpectedly fast and the resulting position allowed the Legions to destroy the first two units of the game. Two to zip, playing to seven flags. 

[ImageID=2397984medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]Unexpected Double Time close combat pins the annoying projectile units without possibility of evasion or retreat. [/i][/COLOR]


Now Hannibal responds, targeting the weakened medium unit and hoping for a good roll against the Romansâ only leader. Carthage shifts and advances, hitting the medium units while bringing up the heavies and incidentally getting Hannibal into the center section (knowing thereâs a Center card to come). The results are good: the stronger medium unit is weakened and driven back, while Semproniusâ unit is destroyed, forcing him back onto one of the only Roman heavies he has. 

For the next several turns each side repositions or trades light jabs. Hannibal pushes forward his right wingâs elephants and light cavalry, but neither has the juice to slam into the full strength Roman line and the Romans know it. Sempronius actives a mass of light infantry to whittle down the mediums facing him, and gets a couple blocks to make it worthwhile.

Knowing he has to weaken the primary Roman units in order for Mago to spring the ambush, Hannibal risks slamming his weakened units against Semproniusâ solidified and reorganized center-right. Focusing on the light infantry that fills out much of the Roman line, Hannibal pounds unit after unit until Semproniusâ heavies stand almost alone.

[ImageID=2398484medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]Going for broke, Hannibal drives his weakened line against the Legions. He has to thin their ranks in order for the ambush to be sprung.[/i][/COLOR]

In the multi-turn slugfest that followed there were assaults and counterassaults that whittled down strengths on both sides. If it werenât for Semproniusâ âRallyâ card play the Romans might have been finished right there, but as it stood each army was tenaciously hanging on without any sign of breaking. 

 [ImageID=2398668medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]The âRallyâ card breathed new life into Semproniusâ line and recharged his resistance. [/i][/COLOR]

So still the Roman right wing was still too strong for the ambush to be sprung. After a Roman warrior unit attacked a Carthaginian light infantry (which evaded successfully), the Carthaginian mounted troops sprung forward. Their medium cavalry hammered the warriors, taking acceptable losses in return. While the victory banners would be sweet, the real goal was to bleed the Romans down so the ambush could have maximum impact. 

But then the Romans rudely counterattacked with their own medium cavalry, destroying their damaged Carthaginian counterpart and sending the second of Hannibalâs medium horse recoiling back. The Romans had four victory banners, comfortably ahead of the Carthaginians, but Hannibal knows what he has waiting and feels things are in control. 

And now in turn the Carthage sends its mounted troops forward, war elephants stampeding toward the Roman horse and Hannibalâs own medium cavalry blocking the Roman retreat. This attack had the potential to utterly destroy both Semproniusâ cavalry and his warriors on that flank. 


[ImageID=2398698medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]After charge and countercharge, the Carthaginian war elephants rumble into the fray. (War elephants are cool.) [/i][/COLOR]

But Mars favored his followers, and the Carthaginians could do nothing but finish the crippled Roman warrior unit. And then another unexpected blow descends on Hannibal, for Sempronius decides that he must use his heavy infantry before he loses it. Even though itâs down to a single block, the remaining legionaries surge forwards and destroy their opposing unit. Then with momentum clearly in their favor they advance to attack and destroy yet another of Hannibalâs infantry. 

[ImageID=2398731medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]Even badly damaged Heavy Infantry packs a terrifying punch, as Sempronius shows here. The Romans are now only ONE banner from total victory [/i][/COLOR]

This gave the Romans their 6th victory banner and suddenly things were nerve racking indeed: While they waited for the perfect time to unleash the ambush the Carthaginians had allowed Sempronius to come within one victory of winning outright!! Had Hannibal waited too long?


[ImageID=2398747medium]
[COLOR=#999999][i]Had Hannibal waited too long? Just before the ambush was sprung the battle seemed to belong to the Romans, who had just split the Carthaginian line in two[/i][/COLOR]


With no other choice â and with the ground almost perfectly prepared for it â Mugo burst from his hiding place and struck heavily at the Romans from behind, scattering and slaying wherever he went. Seeing near victory evaporating, Sempronius clung to his only hope â being only one banner from victory â and attacked any unit he could reach, but it wasnât enough.

Then the war elephants on the Carthaginian left hammered forward, crushing several units; a hail of arrows dented an infantry unit on the right; and Semproniusâ overextended heavy infantry in the center was crushed by the only unused heavy Hannibal had remaining.

Hannibal had come from far, far behind and utterly destroyed his opponent. Although for a while it looked like he waited too long, the trap was sprung at the perfect time to maximize its impact  and as one hoped it totally unhinged the Roman force. 

An utterly exciting scenario!</body>

Great session report! One of the things I love about this system is that battles are usually fairly close. Very rarely is any battle a total blow out, unlike actual historical outcomes. I think the designers did a good job of balancing play.

I looked through the scenario book of Ancients, and it seems there&#039;s not a lot of terrain in the maps.  Does that make much of a difference in the games?  I feel that in Nappy it does.

Terrain does not play a big role in most of the scenarios. Most ancient battles were usually fought on open plains where the armies had enough room to maneuver. Of course rivers and bodies of water were used to the victors advantage, i.e. pinning your adversary by using the water feature to block retreat.

I&#039;ve not played Napoleonic, but compared to Memoir &#039;44 CC-Ancients has TONS more depth, terrain or no. There&#039;s not much difference in the mechanics [b] BUT [/b] the unit types and implementation requires way more tactical nuance and sophistication.

More than anything else I simply LOVE the way CC-Ancients rewards historical tactics, without resorting to chrome type rulesets. It&#039;s just built in to the system. 

If you try to use light troops to anchor the line, you&#039;re in trouble. Way better to have them as skirmishers and missile troops, softening up at the outset. The morale rules mean players who keep units in line have an advantage over those who split them up. Cavalry is awesome if used properly but will rebound and maybe fall apart if thrown against intact full strength medium to heavy infantry. Sequencing of what unit attacks which enemy in what order can be the difference between victory and defeat. 

And having cards control the action doesn&#039;t feel restrictive the way it does in Combat Commander, while still being able to reflect command and control differences between armies.

Naploeonics, I believe, has a bit more unit variety, plus the addition of squares and such.

Though I believe the leaders are a bit less powerful.

	<body>I don&#039;t have a good Origin Story that I can remember.  I&#039;ve been playing games solo since I could open the game closet. My interests evolve as I age, but that&#039;s about it.

[b]Playing Right Now[/b]

:thumbsup: [thing=121921]Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island[/thing]: Yep, Still obsessed. Pulled it out every month for a few games. Played 5 of 6 scenarios thus far. Played Scenario 8 four times before finally defeating it (or should I say: successfully starting a family on the island and surviving).

:thumbsup: At the same time, I&#039;ve been reading the rules to the expansion, [thing=144722]Voyage of the Beagle[/thing]. It looks awesome! Now I&#039;ve played scenario 1, and just started scenario 2, which builds off the previous game. This campaign adventure is a great design. Absolutly loving it. This is giving [thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing], my current solo favorite, a huge challenge...

[b]Hope to Play This Month[/b]
[thing=156336]Onirim[/thing]: Snapped this up in January when Cool Stuff got a few copies.  Played twice in January, and reading rules for expansions now.  Taking a trip to visit family and this is coming with me. Expect several plays. Enjoyed first plays, but didn&#039;t love it.

[thing=124708]Mice and Mystics:[/thing] Only played the first two scenarios, and ready to play more.

[thing=119506]Freedom: The Underground Railroad[/thing]: Love the theme and difficulty. Played solo and multiplayer a few times.  

[thing=146791]Shadows of Brimstone[/thing]: Picked this up in January too, and played a few times. Ready for more. I like this, but don&#039;t yet love it.  The character building and theme are great.  However, they give you tons of tokens, yet in order to track your gold and XP, you have to use RPG style pen and paper, which defeat the purpose of most of the tokens. Big turn off and disappointment. Why couldn&#039;t they have built a tracking system into the game? If I wanted pen and paper, I&#039;d go back to RPGs or games without lots of bits.</body>

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Result: Defeat, Death Toll[/COLOR][/b]

Oops!  My bad.  Sorry about that, Humanity.  :(

Not sure what happened, actually.  Things were moving along swimmingly...until they weren&#039;t.  At the mid-point of the Death Toll track, I was in great shape.  I had $18 in funds, four or five molecules had antibodies discovered, and there were only three molecules left in the virus.

[ImageID=2400426medium]

Then, before I knew it, the Death Toll was at Pandemic Level.  The molecule pool was about to run out, and I knew the only one left in the bucket was a bad event.  I drew it....Budget Cuts!  My last four dollars taken away from me.

At that moment there was only one molecule in the virus.  I would have needed some good fortune to find an antibody, but it was within the realm of possibilities.  I could buy the Aspirator MKII, move a couple of proteins around, grab the other two from the incubator, and save the world.

Nope.

No money.  No save.  No Humanity.  :zombie:

Should have been an &quot;easy&quot; win, too.  [b]Awesome game![/b]

While the majority of the galaxy shivers in fear of the Nemesis, the Machine Cult have a plan.  Itâs going to require the corporation of all factions though.  And everyone must be willing to pay the ultimate price.  If the Brain World deems you worthy, it will find use for you during this battle.  But there is no room for those lacking exceptional trade power or battle skills.  For them, they will be turned into scrap metal and replaced with whoever is next in line.  While viewed as a ruthless tactic, it proved itself worthy.  With a full buy in from the Trade Federation and Star Fleet, the Brain World was able to compile an army with the power to take down a Nemesis 3 times its size and strength.  Together the Machine Cult, Trade Federation, and Star Fleet destroyed the impending doom that once was known as Nemesisâ¦</body>

	<body>for the first real solo play in a long while i thought iÂ´d try out something new to myself: 

Played the Doomsday scenario on easy mode... survived the first Doomsday machine but the second destroyed more or less every space ship flying around my homeworld so i decided to stop the game..

here a picture of my last ships defending &quot;Essen&quot;: 

[imageid=2400522 medium]


IÂ´ll try again soon, hopefully!
I quite liked the tension of being able to develop yourself without disturbance for quite a while - always knowing though that this period of peace will have a definite end!

And i just discovered

The key to winning is holding off building your fleet until you&#039;ve researched enough to get a good fleet, but also build a decent number of ships a turn. 

Explore and research at the beginning of the game is what helps you win.

i also thought it might be good to go exploring and colonizing first - but probably should have had more ship yards to produce the necessary fleets quickly on demand - looking forward to the next game!  :arrrh:

	<body>Playing the solo variant from the game&#039;s BGG file section.  Plays nicely, though as it was my first two attempts ever playing the game, the AI beat me very soundly (double my score in the first game!).  A lot of potential though!

:thumbsup: Lovely quality cards
:thumbsup: A unique theme! Yay!
:thumbsup: Multi-purpose cards; love it.

:thumbsdown: The solo variant is HARD! ARGH!
:thumbsdown: My copy had been damaged (hence it was cheap); some cards were rather bent, and I&#039;ve had to bin the insert completely. Doesn&#039;t count as a negative against the game itself, but I couldn&#039;t think of any other downsides just yet. :)

Update 15th Feb: 3 more solo plays tonight, working on adapting the existing solo variant(s) to work slightly more like multiplayer (more realistic bidding, and multi-license bonuses for the AI). Some nice ideas came out of the 3 plays, which I&#039;ll explore more when I next get a chance...</body>

One of my favorite cards games.  The only issue I have with the game is the sorting of the cards when you&#039;re done if you&#039;re mixing in the expansion.  Other than that it&#039;s an amazing game that doesn&#039;t get enough love around here.

I wound up cutting index cards and labeling them. Helps out a lot, but I still hate separating the boat deck after each game. Bleh.

	<body>I had my first game with the Automa, using the [b]Mamas and Papas[/b] setup from Tuscany, on 29th January. I didn&#039;t record it on the January list because it was a learning game, and in the end I played it slightly wrong (I fulfilled a wine order that needed a white wine and a sparkling wine, but I mistakenly used two ordinary wines).

Today I reset the game and played my first proper games. I didn&#039;t win (the Automa is a challenging opponent!), but I scored 16 points in game 1, and 15 points in game 2.

[b]Edit #1 03/02/2015[/b]:
Game 3 - 17 points.
Game 4 - 18 points.
Game 5 - 20 points.

[b]Edit #2 04/02/2015[/b]:
Game 6 - 20 points.  Well, I think I played it all correctly for the first time, so I think I&#039;m now ready to begin the Tuscany Automa campaign in earnest, and hopefully get a win and start unlocking the other expansions!

This is likely to become one of my favourite games.

:thumbsup: It is a beautiful, thematic game with wonderful components.

:thumbsup: It is a relatively straightforward light/medium worker placement game. It is so thematic it is a joy to play (and lose!)

:thumbsup: The Automa and the variety of cards suggest that there is an awful lot of replayability in the game. And then there are the rest of the Tuscany expansions.

:thumbsdown: The Automa is a tough opponent. I&#039;m still only using the &#039;easy&#039; version. The &#039;normal&#039; and the &#039;hard&#039; versions (also termed &#039;aggressive&#039;!) are scaring me at the moment :surprise:


[size=18][u][b]Origin Story[/b][/u][/size]

I can&#039;t honestly remember how I first came across the SGOYT lists. It undoubtedly stemmed from my compulsive trawling of BGG for solo gaming content. As solitaire games are the most common games to be found on my table/floor/hotel desk etc., it was natural for me to peruse and contribute.

I&#039;ve always played games solo, right from when I was very young, often playing each side in my multi-player games. The number of games now that are solely for one player is staggering. I have a fair few now myself (yes, many as a result of SGOYT and the 1-Player Guild). I look forward to continuing to seek and try new solitaire games, and learn about some of them from here.

Put this on the table last night.
Only played the easy setting with 1 character however both games were fun.

Main thing is it&#039;s quick to setup, quick to play.

May reprint some of the larger cards so it all fits in a smaller tuck box for travel though.

	<body>Played three games of this as part of the GOLO February SGOYT challenge that can be found here if you&#039;re interested:

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312881/golo-challenge-royal-county-down-golf-club

The Royal County Down Golf Club is the course for February. It&#039;s an out 35, in 36, par 71 course. My scores for the three games were 74, 70 and 78.

In the first game, I was dead on-par for the first four holes and then bogeyed the next two to put me at two-over. I then shot two birdies to put me back even, but ended the front nine with a double-bogey on a par 4 and shot a two-over 37 going out. I started off the back nine with a bogey and a birdie followed by four straight even holes. I was hoping to make up some ground on the final three holes, but was only able to manage bogey, even, even for a 1-over 37 coming in and a 3-over 74 for the round.

I started off great in the second game with an eagle on a par 5 and a birdie on a par 4 before shooting three straight even holes. I lost my focus on hole 6 and shot a triple-bogey. I managed to even, birdie, even to finish the front nine at a 1-under 34. I called bottoms on my first roll on the back nine and that generated a hole-in-one on a par 3 with two even-par holes and a birdie following that. I was two-under for the back nine going into hole 17, but with my mulligan used up, shot a double-bogey and par to finish even for the final nine holes. Since I was one-under on the first nine, that kept me at a one-under 70 for the round; my best effort of the day.

In the third game, I shot dead even on every hole of the front nine, save for a birdie on hole #2 so that once again left me at a one-under 34 as in the second game. I didn&#039;t fare so well on the back nine however. I was two-over going into hole 17, but then shot a quadruple and a double bogey on the last two holes that put me at 8-over for the back nine and 7-over for the round. </body>

	<body>Decided to dust off an older game. The dice gods were not kind to me tonight. Luckily though I stumbled across this gem of a chart that has substitutions for all of the locations in the game!

https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/69612/location-substitutions

This takes my biggest gripe about the game (solo game only lets you use 1/4th of the cards in the game) and throws it out the window. This adds a ton of life to a game that I&#039;d pretty much been done with until now.

Of course I lost half of my marines before leaving the Void Lock, but that&#039;s a different story. Looking forward to pulling this out more often, and I might even pick up the expansions now that I have this chart :)</body>

The Damn Manticore kept coming out and I couldn&#039;t keep the Desert(the region it attacks) from being detroyed..so the Captial City went down and it was game over.
My initial impressions are: It&#039;s quick, component quality is good, and I think it has some pretty good decisions to make. The decks(which drive the game) are set up by the number of players and difficulty level. I played as one character, but since it&#039;s co-op you could do multiple.</body>

One character? I thought that the minimum characters were 2!?
Anyhow this little game is awesome!
It totally replaced longer and bigger games like Defenders of the Realm, which take was away too long to set up and play.

That is correct. The production rule book says one player, but I just checked the forums, and it was an error.
It is awesome for sure! I just love that it such fun in a small box!

This is it right here: my first post to Solitaire Games On Your Table!


Played a quick game of this on Sunday and promptly got slaughtered.  May try again with 4 combat teams.

:thumbsup: Quick to setup and tear down.
:thumbsup: Lots of tough choices to make.
:thumbsup: Plays fast.
:thumbsdown: I die. A lot.

Just ordered [thing=25729][/thing] with [thing=33490][/thing] off the GeekMarket.  Hope to get it by the end of this week.</body>

Welcome.

I think the second edition of Eisenbach gap (the deluxe version) might come with a better rulebook.

Either way the game series is a ton of fun.  I&#039;ve collected the majority of it by watching the geek market closely.

	<body>Finished the night with Ghost Stories. This game is always tense and always reminds me of why it&#039;s my top rated game on the geek.

Played with the Guardpost in place of the dude who lets you get two Tao tokens. Had a few close calls, but made it all the way to Wu Feng. 5 black. Had 2 black Tao tokens, all Taoists stacked on Wu Feng with 1 Qi left, and a full board. Sacrificed my Red Taoist at the Sorcerer to give Blue one last chance at a double attack on Wu Feng. Two reds and a black. Roll again. Green, blue, yellow.... Oh well, till next time

Learned a couple lessons though. First, going Yin-Yang into Sorcerer too many times will cripple you if you don&#039;t manage the deck tempo. Also trying to blind roll 2 Tao dice will almost never work and is a really poor move.

I need to get better at placing my 1-2 ghosts. I never am sure how to setup my corners properly and always mess up my positioning both of taoists and ghosts

:thumbsup: Always tense and fun
:thumbsdown: Rulebook didn&#039;t really translate well
:thumbsdown: Card quality could be better

	<body>After clipping counters for the D-Day Twins, I decided I was in enough of a groove to finish clipping mine for this 23 year old classic from John Butterfield and Eric Lee Smith.

This one box contains 5 different battles from the War of Northern Aggression: Bull Run, Shiloh, Bentonville, Gettysburg and the one pictured below, Pea Ridge

[imageid=2400996medium]

Easy to digest rules, frustrations of the close up combat requirements (hard to get a LOS for artillery, for example), and interesting chit pull mechanic make this one pretty fun and easy to play solo.

My pea brain just got through the first two turns of Pea Ridge and despite early Southern sweep, the Union is gonna kick butt soon.  The confederates only get what they started with and the bad guys get reinforcements all throughout the battle.  Just took two of the Union objectives, but was immediately driven off of one due to poorly executed attack on the Rebel&#039;s part...

Justin - my favorite ACW game to play solo is GMT&#039;s [thing=5228][/thing], which contains both Bulls Runs and Chickamauga.   It uses a chit-pull system, which is great for solitaire.  Unfortunately, it is out of print but you might find one on the secondary market.  There are two more in the series, but I have not played them: [thing=6559][/thing] and [thing=23928][/thing].  Note that Glory II has some updated counters and rules for Glory, but they are not necessary to enjoy the first game.

It&#039;s a pretty good one (so far).  Has the solo ease of Combat Commander.  Low counter density, simple rules, etc...[/q]

Oh weird. Maybe I was just watching it closely.

Don&#039;t want to get too off-topic with videogames and all, but [thing=172105][/thing] is out and it&#039;s amazing. Why you should look into it.

For a wargame, it&#039;s dirt simple to learn. 

It adheres to realism (reasonably), with terrain playing a big part. The map was created using satellite imagery (combined with other methods, naturally)! 

The AI is smart, including the AI that controls your units when your attention is elsewhere. Each run through the campaign plays differently.

It does not need a supercomputer to run. I was able to run this on my sluggish laptop from 2009 that takes a year to load a page from Google Sheets in my browser. 

Battles last about 30 minutes. 

It looks great! (Large pic is large, so link provided)

The reason I mention this game is the image above reminds me a lot of it.

Anyone wants to hit me up for a multiplayer game, let me know :)

	<body>So I came home from work expecting to see the copy of Gears of War I ordered when I heard it was going OOP. Well, it was there, just not in the &quot;new&quot; condition they said it was. Far from it. No shrink wrap, worn box, tons of pieces missing. Reboxed, filled out return with Amazon. There goes this evening&#039;s gaming.... :( Maybe I&#039;ll be able to trade for GoW or something in the future.

So, back to the original plan: Flash Point was going to be my &quot;game of the week&quot; that I left set up on the dining room table while my wife is on a business trip. I played the hazmat tech, the CAFS firefighter, and the imaging tech but I lost as usual (stop fallng down, buildings!) but it was good to get reacquainted with the rules. It&#039;s a good co-op but not my favorite one but a keeper nonetheless.

+ I really like the theme since it&#039;s so different
+ I also think it makes for a very intense gaming experience

- It&#039;s quite fiddly and sometimes I find myself struggling to remember all the upkeep. A game like Pandemc feels more organic to me while here I keep forgetting things like hot spots or refreshing POIs. Oh well, I&#039;ll get better with practice.

UPDATE: I&#039;m going to also be chronicling my solo gaming adventures here: [geeklist=186770][/geeklist]</body>

Yeah, there are some total scam artists for board games on Amazon.com these days.  I had one try to pawn off an EMPTY BOX.

There wasn&#039;t another game available, so they told me to return the empty box. Amazon customer service magic could not do anything much, but I did get refunded fully.

	<body>This is my go-to weeknight game.  It&#039;s also my 100 Plays game, and I was making very steady progress until I bought LOTR:LCG (ha ha ha). 

I played game #19 tonight and scored my all time best....85!!  

The funny thing is, I almost lost in the first round, I squeaked by with just one life left.  Then the cards just kept coming up perfectly, and I drew a destroy card with an aging card nearly every time.  

The stars were aligned for me (and Friday) tonight.

:thumbsup: Great little game full of important decision-making moments.

:thumbsdown: The aging cards are...odd.
:thumbsdown: If you&#039;ve never read Robinson Crusoe, then this game is a spoiler.

It&#039;s hard to saying anything *really* bad about this game. :D</body>

Really, this game is a spoiler for the book? Huh, I never thought of that. I haven&#039;t read the book but I know the premise. I guess I just figured it was a play on the theme. Shipwrecked, pirates, scary and dangerous island, and Friday. That&#039;s funny.

THIS!

As for Raid on St. Nazaire, I&#039;ve clung to my original copy and break it out every couple years.  Something enticing about running that gauntlet of fire and the random German spawning.

Of course the cat-mauled commando counter adds something to the bloody mess... :D

	<body>After the recent release of my second Dominion SoloPlay variant (the pyramid challenge, the file link is the same as the original variant) I have returned to finishing up the Five Tribes solo variant. All that is left is more playtesting and a visual aid to better describe a key mechanic.

I am struggling to perform well as I always seem to get my timing off. I have only had one master level victory but in my last five I have only reached major success. I have calculated that it is possible to hit 300 but the best I have achieved is 241.

Additionally, I have extensively playtested my Dice Masters SoloPlay variant and it is holding up very well. The last setup I tried 5+ times and I could not get the right combo of actions and heroes to finish the job. I got him down to 3 health before succumbing to defeat. This is a fairly straight forward variant and is being tested with AvX and Uncanny X Men. Not sure if future sets will support the design but it seems versatile enough.</body>

Thank you for your fantastic variants. I love Five Tribes as a multiplayer game, so I will almost certainly be picking it up and trying your variant at some point.

Edit: Just looked at your Pyramid variant, and it looks scrumptious. I love the Kingdom Card sets you call out at the end, sort of like a challenges/achievements mode if you have all the expansions to try them.

	<body>First play of this game this month on level 2. I made it to the red phase but lost on the first card.

Green Phase went quite badly and I had 2 life left at the end of it. Moved in to the yellow phase and at one point had 0 life left. I managed to regain 3 life and survived to the end of the phase. The first cards of the red phase had the same values so made no difference which one I picked. The first card I turned over for the fight was the Stop aging card. That cost me more life than I had remaining and ended the game. Had I of been able to spend my remaining life and drawn the full number of cards I still would not have won the fight.

Score: 31 for fighting cards, -5 for aging card, 0 for pirates, 0 for remaining life, -42 for hazard cards. Total = -16

:thumbsdown: - I lost the fight :(

[b][i]Edit 19/2 - Second Game[/i][/b]
This game was played on level 2 difficulty. I defeated the pirates and still had some food left to celebrate.

The cards were much nicer to me today. When I wanted to get rid of cards, I always seemed to be the correct distance behind the goal to get rid of the cards without having spare discarded food. The only bad draw (if you can call it that) I had involved going for a goal of 4 and drawing a -2 aging card followed by a Stop aging card. This caused me to lose 6 food but I did discard both aging cards in one go.

In the red phase I managed to gain food and ended up facing the pirates with 8 food remaining. The pirates proved a little challenging as I had to spend 6 food but both were beaten.

Score: 41 for fighting cards, -5 for aging card, 30 for pirates, 10 for remaining life, -21 for hazard cards. Total = 56

:thumbsup: - The four different difficulty levels mean that the game remains a challenge even after mastering one difficulty.
:thumbsdown: - The game takes too long for me to have 2 plays on my lunch break.</body>

	<body>Newer cooperative game built on the same theme as Pandemic but executed with dice instead of cards.   Each role has their own unique set of dice while infection dice are rolled to see where the infections are occuring.

Played with 4 characters - Generalist, Scientist, Contingency Planner and Containment Specialist.  Lost due to outbreaks.

Really like this so far, quickly has become my go-to solo game when I have 30-40 minutes.    </body>

	<body>[size=16][b]Not-so-Secret Origin Story[/b][/size]

When I was a teenager I joined my class for an outing at the local science center.  They were demonstrating their ability to control radioactive rays in the lab. It was fascinating but then things got a little fuzzy, I vaguely recall being bit by a spider.... wait, no that&#039;s not it.

Back in Feb/Mar 2013 I bought a copy of Thunderbolt Apache Leader, this was my first Solo only game though I had some others that accommodated one player (like Space Empires 4X and Arkham Horror). I had been checking out some DVG titles because I was interested in a war game that I could play against an AI rather than playing both sides and I had fun with the solo option in SE4X. I really enjoyed TAL and so I started looking into other solo game options.  I won a copy of Friday in May that year from G4GG and started looking at games with an eye toward 1-player compatibility.  Later that year my wife and I were excited to find we were expecting so I accelerated my search for more solo options, figuring my game group nights would become more limited. This led to winning a copies of Ogre Pocket and The Wreck of the B.S.M Pandora again from G4GG plus pre-ordering Robinson Crusoe and putting Marvel Legendary on my radar. 

In April 2014 our son was born and my parents gave me a copy of Silverton for my birthday.  I believe that month I also joined the 1-Player Guild which led me to finding this geeklist.  My first post was for a handful of Silverton plays and I still enjoy playing it.

I keep coming back because it&#039;s a great community of players and where else can you get this kind of social interaction for a relatively lonely gaming niche? :D

:redtrain::greentrain::bluetrain::yellowtrain::blacktrain::purpletrain::whitetrain:

So on to my Marvel play... I received the GotG expansion for Christmas and hadn&#039;t checked it out yet so I decided to try a game with Thanos, Starlord, Rocket and Groot with the Unite the Shards Scheme.  The shards add an interesting element to the game.  I failed to win because Thanos picked up more than 10 shards, I wasn&#039;t paying attention to what he had and I thought I could get one more turn in to attack him directly before another event caused him to gain more - I should have known better.

It was good, I like what the shards add and the new characters &amp; schemes to explore. I also decided that I&#039;m going to try to play strictly by the &quot;Golden&quot; solo rules for my next few plays to see how that is versus the regular advanced solo rules.  I checked them out before when I just had the base game but I picked up Dark City and started using those rules shortly thereafter so I don&#039;t recall how I liked them.  However, seeing a few people saying recently that&#039;s all they use makes me want to check them out again.

Sorry, I retract my 177 and previous 162. I just reread the review posted on BGG which had the rules. Somehow I missed the part of shuffling all 20 cards together, instead having 2 separate 10 pile suits. I guess it made some thematic sense to me to have a &#039;pin suit&#039; and a &#039;ball suit&#039;. So I&#039;ll restart with the right rules... And keep playing until I get 177!

I wondered, but I didn&#039;t want to accuse anyone of anything.

The challenge still stands, though, someone get 162!

A frustrating 120.  The card I needed always seemed to be buried in one of the ball piles.  Strikes and spares were in short supply this game.

Woo!  Tried the challenge myself this afternoon and bowled what was probably my best game:

X  63 8- 52 8- X 9/ 9- X X8-

135

Still no where near 162, or even Ken&#039;s 150, but I&#039;m awfully proud of myself.  Of course, the 10 I needed to get the spare on the 10th was at the bottom of the stack, but except for the 4th frame, I can be awfully happy.

just got a legit 176.  

176 = 1/ 8- X X 8/ 0/ 9- X X 8/6
(18 26 54 74 84 103 112 140 160 176)

It was a surprising game since my best had been 148 with an average of 130. Then I followed it with a 174 which featured 7 strikes but no spares.

	<body>Kyle invited us to recall our [b] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/186592/item/3710900#item3710900]origin game[/url][/b] entrance in SGOYT list and Stig proposed to play it again as a [b][url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/186592/item/3710910#item3710910]challenge[/b][/url] and to compare the feelings between today and the origin.


Even if I knew the SoS games by VPG (and have a lot of them in my game collection) I entered DotZ univers very late because I&#039;m NOT a Zombies fan AT ALL! [i]and I&#039;d rather play a game when I&#039;ve got, at least a slight, interest for the theme. [/i]

I recall pretty clearly my first contact with DotZ. It was a disaster (after something like 10 cards, the Zombies were in Town) and spectacular: I found it cinematographic! How could I found a Zombie Game cinematographic without having watched a single Zombies&#039; movie ? 

That&#039;s the fabulous sweet spot of DotZ: [b]this game knows how to tell a story! [/b]

Your playing units are Heroes and villagers. 

The first ones have very different abilities and offer a large number of options to choose from each time (of course, you just can&#039;t do even the tenth of what you wished.... Where would be the pleasure if you hadn&#039;t meaningful choices to make on your turn?). The seconds are really a pain: they will stick into their respective villages, totally carefree, until the Zombies knock at their doors. Then, they will either defend their lands to death (which will come soon - some are pretty weak) or flee as refugees to find protection in Town and infect town&#039;s population.

It&#039;s a survival game with many combats. The combats against Zombies are resolved with die rolls (integrating various strengths and defensive/offensive factors: there is a tactical impact there). I do protest loudly sometimes when the dice are against me. Something I rarely do, except while playing Ambush! 

[i][b]Today, I played another game of DoTZ. [/b][/i]

Quiet beginning. After some turns, no more Zeds on the suburbs track and the mountain track. Johnson was having a great time foraging for supplies while Agee was busy on her microscope researching for the Super-Weapon in the Laboratory. Mayor Hernandez was taking care of the city business while Carter was on the road again. 

It was almost too peaceful to be true. At some point, I was fearing the lack of pressure.... 

And then, in few turns, it became frantic: a disaster occurred into the lab. My heroes were not specially good at gun-firing: they wasted so many ammo missing their targets. Bubbas&#039; band entered Farmingdale countryside through the highway track; Carter was hoping to fight back with his gambling gamers&#039; luck, but couldn&#039;t make it. Johnson missed his target (a big fat 8 strength Zeds) and the last fleeing refugees on the Forest track were eaten. 
Infection level increased: outbreak occurred.

After that, I lost control: Johnson with a useless gun - no more ammo - had to fight a hand-to-hand Combat and died. Zombies were everywhere, coming out of the tunnel. One could hear the mysterious Dr Marteuse laughing.

I ended up losing again with Zombies in Town before the National Guard could rescue me.

[b]How did it feel compare to the first game I played last year? Just as much fun as ever![/b] :D

[i]Edit: numerous spelling, and I&#039;m sure I still missed some...[/i]

Sounds like your experience with DotZ was exactly the same as mine: I had quite a few other SoS titles and ignored this because of the theme and the seemingly endless stream of zombie themed games that were being produced. I finally decided to try DotZ because of many favourable reviews and I&#039;m so glad I did: I was blown away by the narrative potential of the game. It&#039;s since then easily become my favourite SoS because the stories each game tell are so enthralling and varied, and because the game is so much fun to play.

I made a comment a while ago on a DotZ session report that I no longer think in terms of winning or losing this game, instead I just enjoy how each story develops. It&#039;s quite rare for a game to achieve that.

I recommend picking up the Director&#039;s Cut if you haven&#039;t already done so. It adds a couple of new heroes, some new super Zeds, but most importantly a stack of additional cards with other stories to tell. :)

Very good advice indeed, Paul. I did buy Directors Cut as soon as it was available. And anyone who likes DotZ should get it. Today&#039;s report mentioned only familiar Heroes because I&#039;m traveling and played the game on Cardwarden on my iPad and I have yet to add DC to my gamebox... :)

I got this one on Ebay, saturday, 36 â¬ and it arrived today! Like Ebay was in the old days! ;)

The game is like new. Fantastic! I guess it was not played that often but it will be played many times soon!!! :devil:

Wow, that board is a massive thing! :thumbsup:

I already thought about taking some days off from work! :D  Reached the fourth encounter in [thing=22][/thing], read the rules of [thing=12459][/thing] 3x and the game is ready to be played and now [thing=84419][/thing] arrived!

I wonder if anybody ever took a few days off work for a reason like this? ;) Is it that crazy? :D</body>

You might have a first printing then, the subsequent printings had thicker counters.

I believe the expansion comes with replacements for the core set.

There might have been some changes in the rules, but that would probably mostly be just grammar.  And you can always download the newest ruleset from GMT&#039;s website anyway.  So just the counter thickness.

And like I said, the expansion should come with replacement counters for what&#039;s in the core set.  I know mine did, if shipping wasn&#039;t so much I think I could send you my spares!

	<body>Trying out the SoloPlay rules. Boy are they punishing!  Score level to get victory is 120. I scored 11. In my defence, I played it on &#039;normal&#039; level instead of easy, and it does say it&#039;ll take the player a few games to work out how to tune the starting resources to avoid losing too many points.  If I&#039;d ignored the remaining resources deduction, I would have scored 57. :)

Good fun though.

This is how things looked at game end:

This one [b]is[/b] punishing.

I&#039;ve played this variant a dozen times.  I&#039;ve only &quot;won&quot; once.  But it was a whopping 181 VP.

Two other times I scored triple digits - 101 and 110.  All my other scores range from 3 to 81.  I don&#039;t know what it is about this one, but I just can&#039;t wrap my brain around it.

I haven&#039;t tried it in almost two years now, though.  Might have to dive back in now that I&#039;ve got more game experience in general as well as with the SoloPlay way of gaming.

Good luck, Nick!  Keep at it.

	<body>I&#039;ve been really lax about posting in the past few weeks, partially because we&#039;re seeing the effects of global cooling in MA - over 60&quot; of snow in 9 days had me digging out, again, and again.

I received my copy of BIOS Megafauna the other night and after a long day of shoveling I needed to relax and try to get my latest game to the table. I watched Ricky&#039;s play of this to get an idea on how to play before diving into the rules, and that made this game very accessible.

So far, I&#039;m into the second of the 4 ages of gameplay and my species are thriving well.  I&#039;ve mutated one of the dinosaurs to an amphibian that is nocturnal and is armored/aggressive.  That&#039;s helping me to enter quite a few areas.  I encountered a disaster early on which increased the temperature of the world, but didn&#039;t have any issue surviving - it did limit the AI significantly, so we&#039;ll see how that plays out.  After the first age, I scored 3 points from the tarpit, and the AI took 2 points.

I&#039;m really enjoying the theme of this gameplay and watching the world develop and trying to adapt to the everchanging environment.  It&#039;s still early for me to rate this in my collection, but I&#039;ve got the same enamored feeling that I had with Navajo Wars when I first played that game, so I have a feeling that this will be one that sees repeated plays. 


UPDATE:
I finished my first game which almost ended in an Ice age, but I realized that erosion can&#039;t happen when the environment is at 200, so I lucked out as I would have scored 9 to 4 which would have been 1 shy of a win - but I was fortunate and ended the game 13 to 7.

Now to reset and try again :D</body>

Yes - I&#039;m playing with the living rules - regardless though it&#039;s a typical Eklund style rulebook, which to me is somewhat difficult to get through.  I also had some issue with Pax Porfiriana when I started playing it, but then it made sense once I played the game a few times.  In general I&#039;ve accepted that I&#039;ll make mistakes playing his games when I&#039;m learning them, but around the 4-5th play I expect to have 95%+ of the rules learned.

That&#039;s what keeps me away from some wargames - that and the mountain of chits to manage.  I do play a few, but the amount in my collection is pretty limited (maybe attempting to play A Dark Valley was not a good idea as one of my first few wargames) ;)

A Dark Valley is not too bad.  The activation chits really break up the action into manageable chunks.

Winning as the Germans in the Barbarossa scenario is really difficult.

My first issue with ADV was the size of the map - was larger than my table would allow.  Then I didn&#039;t have plexi for the map, so stacking near the creases was a pain.  The setup took me an hour to figure out.  I got through a few turns, boxed it up and traded it away.  I&#039;m sure somewhere in the future I may attempt again as I liked the look of the map, and the action chits were a good idea; but managing that many stacks was too unwieldy for me.  I actually sold Antiquity for the same reason (even though I loved the game) - too many chits.

My wargames are currently limited to Red Winter, Nuklear Winter &#039;68, some DVG games (TAL, HL:CAO, Field Commander and a few others).  Fields of Fire is on my wishlist, but I&#039;m trying to be good about that this year.

I also tried block wargames with Sekigahara, but soloing that game was not something that worked for me.

	<body>I got my pieces assembled, and while I have the desire to get them all painted, I have a stronger desire to start playing this game.
[b]
Campaign 1 - Prologue
[/b]
[i]US Marshal, Peter Gosler, enjoys his beer at the local saloon.  The beer and girls, as nice a distraction as they can be, are not his primary attraction.  While there, two Navajo men he has had his eye on for some time are conversing in a darker, corner table of the establishment.  

Then he sees it, an exchange.  Evidence enough for Pete to take the next step.  The two Navajo men, stand and part ways.  Marshal Gosler tails his primary mark, a Navajo, removed from the tribe, and removed from town, a local outcast who answers to the name John Redfeather.  

Redfeather leads Pete to a run down shack, presumably his dwelling, and enters through a rusty corrugated metal door.  Light begins to flicker through a window as Redfeather lights the lamps within.  Pete, creeps to the window and peeks in, to see John Redfeather, staring blankly into a chunk of black crystal, which seems to be casting an eerie purple aura on John&#039;s face.

John, with preternatural senses, turns to see the Marshal peering through the window, transfixed by the soft, eerie, crystal shard.  Not knowing the voyeur is a Marshal, raises his rifle at the man, demanding him off his land.  

Pete, slowly raises his badge into view.  The motion had it&#039;s desired outcome.  If not preventing, at least delaying a violent outcome to this encounter.

Forgetting his job, drawn to the stone...Pete can only mutter, &quot;What is that dark stone?&quot; 

&quot;It is not yours.  Forget you saw it, and get off my land.&quot; John demands, putting the crystal into a bag.

Regaining his senses, Pete sees the piles of coin and cash on the table.  

&quot;Look, it&#039;s not what you think.  I found a vein of the crystal in a nearby mine, and have found some men willing to buy it.  There is nothing illegal going on.&quot;

&quot;Take me to this vein, show me, and I will leave you alone.&quot;
[/i]

[b]Session 1 - Exploration - Threat Low[/b]

[i]The two men enter the mine.  Redfeather moves ahead, eager to prove his story to Gosler.   He turns a corner, momentarily out of sight from Goslerâ¦when Pete turns the corner, a great crab like creature lurks in the cornerâ¦feeding on something on the ground.   Redfeather fires his rifle masterfully, getting off three shots in seconds, two of which connect center mass and the third blasting off a claw.  The creature drops before it can make a move towards the pair.

âWhat the hell?â Peter barely had time to comprehend what he saw.
âCome, stay togetherâ Redfeather beckons.

As they wind their way deeper into the mine, Peter is overwhelmed by a horrible stench, and begins to wretch so violently, his vomit is blood streaked.  

âUp hereâ John leads, unphased.

A glowing aura around the bend is bouncing its light off the cavern wall.  Turning the corner, Peter canât believe his eyes.  A swirling pool of light, suspended near the wall of the room. 

âWhat is that?â He asks.

âThe door to the evil spirit world, it has opened, and remains so.  The black crystals in this mine draw evil here.â
 
âCome, the deposit is this wayâ

The men enter a final cavernous room, with a huge piles of bones, animal, human, unhuman strewn about, and a vein of the black crystal visible on a far wall.

A strange clicking sound, alerts the two men.  A half dozen or so of huge crustaceous spiders, with huge gaping mouths on their abdomens, skitter with great speed at the men.  They have no time to react, and both are overwhelmed.  

[imageid=2401913 medium]

Two of the spiders manage to knock Pete to one knee as they rear up, kicking with their forelegs and gnash with their strangely placed mouths.  Two more swarm on John.  Both men take large gashes from the claws on the spiders kicking forelegs.  Redfeather lets a series of bullets fly, dropping two of the spiders.  Likewise, Pete unleashes his shotgun and also drops 2.  The spiders donât seem to know what is good for them and the remaining 2 clamber over the corpses of their bretheren, but both meet the same fate.
The men approach the deposit.  

Redfeather runs his hand across it. 
 
Suddenly John pulls his hand back, as if it was hot, or caused painâ¦..

[/i]

	<body>Read the walkthrough, up to the part where you can start playing.
Got to say, it&#039;s beginning to look like this game deserves the praise.
All the possibilities of moves sounds really cool.

Probably have to wait until Saturday to give it a go, but I am really looking forward to it.

Not a fan of the insert. Ordered a Plano box and some deck boxes to hold everything neater.</body>

Don&#039;t be offput if your first game is a bit of a slog in terms of referencing rules. Provided the gameplay appeals to you, persistence will repay you a thousand fold.

Thanks Phil. Yeah that&#039;s why I am waiting for the weekend, so I can take forever without worrying about anything.

Before I bought it, I tried just reading the rulebook, before the walkthrough. Total madness, I had no idea what they were talking about. :laugh: Now it is already starting to come together.

The insert looks so good at first, but that first impression was such a lie.  I tossed it all and went the Plano route.  I have it set up to store everything from the base game and both expansions except Volkare. He has to stand alone in the box.  Which is fine because he is kind of a jerk.

I could fit him in there if I was going strickly for storage, but I like to play out of the Plano which required more space so I can easily pull out tokens and such.

Interesting, a bit thinky, and I&#039;m having a hard time actually figuring out what I can sell when.  Perhaps if I made some goods tokens, that would alleviate the issue?

2 Scott Almes games in one day. Nice. ;)

I have tried Harbour (solo only) and I liked it. I wish they would have stuck with each good having it&#039;s own track, but I guess this way makes it easier to change the market. Oh well.

I didn&#039;t back TED but did back the Tiny Epic Galaxies on KS (currently going).

	<body>Solo...of course!:thumbsup:

Vietnam air war featuring USAF F-105 and F-4 missions over North Vietnam.  Air to ground missions and air to air when those pesky Migs rise to the occasion.

Fun with good detail but not complex.  During my first mission I experienced a &quot;dud Thud&quot; and lost a pilot...but made up for it when one of my escorting F-4s downed a Mig-17.

Print and Play -- some don&#039;t like these but I do since they are cheaper and I can buy more games with my bucks.  Very good quality for print and play.

Earned the &quot;Swamp Hamster Seal of Approval&quot; since my dad served as an RF-4 crew chief in 1965-1966...and an RF-101 crew chief during the Cuban Missile Crisis -- thus my icon in his honor.

Good game.:thumbsup:

	<body>A very recent purchase. Set up for my first playthrough of &quot;Emergence&quot; last night.

I had borrowed this previously from Moe, and I remembered it being hard, but this game seemed impossible! Lost after three turns with about 14 locusts on the board. Is this game really this hard?

d&#039;oh... even though I was playing with 2 COGs somehow I seeded the board as if I were playing with 4 COGs... 

Played again and made it almost to the exit. Much better :p</body>

Lately I have been having more success at picking something to play. After a burst of obsession with some of my new games (shadows of brimstone!) I am starting to cycle back through some of my earlier purchases. Zombicide is seeing a renaissance on my table right now.

I work construction and due to the winter weather (and some outdoor sites) I am actually on my first day of a week (maybe two) off! I am hoping my gaming motivation remains high, could get a lot of plays in over this little vacation.

	<body>I played two more games of Infection. This game is such a treat and I enjoy it so much. It&#039;s becoming quick and it&#039;s so easy to pull off the shelf and bust through a game. 

One of the things I&#039;ve started to enjoy is the different ways the virus spreads from game to game. My first game, the virus spread rather slowly, so it was fairly easy to keep everything under control. It was a good victory and I never felt like I was losing. In the second game the virus mutated at an alarming rate. I had molecules on the C-Ring starting on the very first turn and I was never able to clear it out. The randomness of the card draws makes for almost a different scenario every time I play. In the first game I had a slow-building, smart virus that was taking its time to work its way through the world&#039;s population. In the second game, I fought against a raging, hate-filled disease who cared only about spreading itself to its next victim. The second game felt like I was bracing myself against a door folding off the inevitable horde trying to break through. 

I also tried the lab equipment rental variant. That was really fun. It forced me to care for my lab equipment rather than hope I was successful but didn&#039;t worry if I wasnt. 

I think I&#039;m going to start using the paper map because the middle puzzle piece has begun to stick up.  It&#039;s a bummer because I like the puzzle piece map, but the paper map seems really nice quality. </body>

Actually, if you keep the frame, such as for a poster, you can move the map from table to table, or room to room, easily.  

I buy cheap poster frames at Michaels.

Thanks, I am! 

I am in the final week of my final class. It ends Monday, February 9th. I finished my final assignment yesterday and I only have a handful of discussion questions left (since it&#039;s online, discussion threads are where the class takes place). That means, I&#039;ll be done with all my work by tomorrow. 

This has been my toughest class so the bulk of my free time has been spent on homework this last month. I&#039;ve looked, with longing, at BGG a few times and then had to turn it off to do homework. But not anymore! I&#039;m almost done for good. 

It feels really surreal, but I&#039;m so excited. Mostly because I&#039;m about to graduate college! It only took me 18 years. :)

Thanks, I was going to hold a solo-con to celebrate but my wife&#039;s grandma passed away so there are more important things to take care of.

It also changes the excitement of my final days in school, as it rightly should.

Thanks.  It was time.  She had been in pretty bad pain the last few weeks and hadn&#039;t eaten anything in like 10 days.  It&#039;s sad to see her go, but it&#039;s good to know she has peace, finally.

	<body>I had never tried this game before the Kickstarter for the Big Box started, but I grabbed an early bird slot on account of my absolute LOVE for [b][thing=38453][/thing][/b] and this being another real-time co-op game, albeit less thinky. The game arrived over my birthday weekend a few days ago, and I finally made the time to play it today.

I played four times in total (that&#039;s one of the perks of a real-time game; they&#039;re usually pretty short): two plays using the basic tiles, and two plays using Curses &amp; Treasures and 10 gems in the depot. For the first couple of plays, I was pretty underwhelmed, although I understand that I was pretty much playing the game on &quot;family mode.&quot; The latter two were much more challenging and enjoyable--the first time I played with Curses and 10 gems, I escaped at the same moment the temple collapsed. I&#039;m counting it as a win, although it really was down to the wire (it depends on when you consider an action completed--I rolled the keys needed before the soundtrack ended, but I didn&#039;t actually pick up and reroll the dice used to escape until [i]after[/i] the sound effect for the collapse).

I am very much looking forward to trying out the other expansions and Queenies and then working through the [b][filepage=93450]26 Challenges[/filepage][/b] in order. The Mayan Calender Queenie also looks like it will change up the game in a significant way.

:thumbsup: Quick to play thanks to the real-time nature.

:thumbsup: Those curses make discovering new chambers something to dread--in my first two plays, I figured out that it was always a good idea to discover a bunch of chambers before the first gong and then go through and activate gems. Playing with the curses module made me quickly abandon that strategy.

:thumbsup: Lots of variety with the Big Box and Kickstarter promos. Most of it is solo friendly (pretty much everything except Linked Chambers, one of the promo quests, and some curses/treasures).

:thumbsdown: You can tell it&#039;s better with a group.

:thumbsdown: I kept getting the curse where I had to put one hand on my forehead.

:thumbsdown: I am clumsy and keep accidentally flipping dice when picking up a different group to reroll.

:thumbsdown: Not nearly as good as Space Alert.</body>

	<body>I have very different feelings about the Le Havre solo game out of the box as opposed to Agricola out of the box. I&#039;m not sure why but will need to work out why 

Also, Le Havre really is easier to play with little containers. 

[imageid=2402257 medium]

Le Havre and Ora et Labora are somewhat related in that they both use double-sided goods tiles, a fiddly thing that I&#039;m glad didn&#039;t pop up again in the Harvest Heptalogy. Other than that, I am amused watching some of the trends that started in Agricola either continue, get mutated, or be removed entirely. 

But Le Havre has always been a difficult game for me to figure out. I don&#039;t feel particularly attached to the theme (in fact, I feel entirely apathetic for it). And for whatever reason, I definitely feel more pressure to feed my people than I did in Agricola, which isn&#039;t a great feeling for me because Agricola is already stressful enough that way. 

I finished filming and editing the first video for &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Solo&quot;; it&#039;ll go up on Thursday. In the meanwhile, need to get in one more play of Core Worlds with Galactic Orders (SoloPlay variant) and then start the instructional video. 

The lateral arm arrived along with the tripod of doom, and the test overhead videos are very successful. The lighting needs to be improved, so I sent away for some better bulbs. 

I now have an empty room upstairs that I should start filling with shelves filled with games at some point.</body>

I just had a play of this. Don&#039;t have the brainpower to write a story yet, but here&#039;s my setup:

Ship: Supply Bot
Base: Brain World
My Authority: 16
Beast&#039;s Authority: -20

That leaves me with a score of 36.

After rapidly trimming my deck, I tried to build a Blob fleet defended by some Trade Federation outposts. Note that I was playing with some cards from the Crisis expansions, which may have made things a bit easier.</body>

Pathetic score of 224. The score jump from Agricola&#039;s double-digits to Le Havre&#039;s and later on Ora et Labora&#039;s triple-digits is a bit of scoring whiplash. I think I played a little bit wrong, since I only did settlement after pushing the little teal house, so that score is not a true score, which makes me very sad. 

I didn&#039;t get around to earning any of the 30pt VP tiles, but I did manage to build all but 1 of my settlements thanks to use of the neutral player&#039;s castle. 

Ora et Labora&#039;s official solo variant feels rough around the edges. Of all the Harvest Heptalogy, Ora et Labora feels as though it has the most exceptions to the multiplayer game. I mean, even the two-player game has exceptions to the 4- and 3-player game, and then the solo game builds further exceptions on top of the two-player game. 

The double-sided goods tiles leads to more interesting dynamics when upgrading goods (the upgrades are particularly interesting in Ora et Labora), and Ora et Labora starts the &quot;everything is laid out before you&quot; stage in the Harvest Heptalogy, except Ora does it in stages, whereas later games like Caverna and Fields of Arle just bombard you with everything from the get-go. 

I think Fields of Arle does this sort of thing better than previous games in the series; Fields feels like the most refined of the series. 

But hey, I should really save all this analysis for upcoming videos. </body>

I really like the theme of this and have really enjoyed Loyang. I&#039;ve not gotten in to Agricola much yet and I think Glass Road is kind of fun. I also know this is hard to find. Should I consider it?

There is... probably a reason why every other Rosenberg game is still in print and Ora et Labora is not. I think... I think, and I say this despite loving Rosenberg&#039;s games in general... I think it&#039;s forgettable. 

The little wheels mechanic in Glass Road and the wheel mechanic in Le Havre: The Inland Port both come from Ora et Labora, but Ora&#039;s implementation was... rougher around the edges. 

Imagine if you will this: every resource has a marker on the wheel, like in Glass Road, all on one side of the wheel. But in Glass Road, you have a tight hold on resources. In Ora, you often end up with excess resources (like 7-10 of over half the things); kind of like if the 3 wood space in Agricola was on steroids and applied for every resource. So in solo, there is rarely a feeling that you can&#039;t do enough with what you have, which is why the [i]normal[/i] goal is 400 points (the &quot;astonishing&quot; goal is never even mentioned). 

In fact, Rosenberg had to remove two of the resource markers to give challenge to the solo game: ore and grapes. It kind of irks me in a way, but I have to agree with the design decision. Ora suffers the most in the Harvest series in solo, because the lack of competition is that much more obvious and detrimental to the tension. 

Still, obviously Ora is not a walk in the park; you have to be able to handle the various paths to victory and not get confused or inefficient. The buildings are fun, you can definitely get some interesting engines up and going, and if you choose different paths each time, fun can be had for quite some time. And it&#039;s a very relaxed kind of game. I mean, you&#039;re monks making alcohol. Tension would be kind of wrong from a theme perspective. 

To consider also: the 3-4 player game plays very different from the 2-player game which plays very different from the solo game. Of all the games in the Harvest series, the difference is the most palpable. Rosenberg really had to hack things up to make solo workâand I do appreciate this, since Rosenberg seems to always try to fit solo into his games, which is rare enough in eurogame/amerithrash design. 

I like this theme far better than Le Havre&#039;s, but I would rather play Le Havre, and I don&#039;t like Le Havre. 

I would say... unless you find Ora for trade and are giving away what you feel is a mediocre game for it... I would not try very hard to get it. Others will feel differently of course, but that&#039;s just my take on the matter.

Get fields of Arle instead, it&#039;s a better solo game that still scratches the &quot;many paths to victory&quot; itch.  :)

	<body>My first post on SGoYT for my first two plays of LOTR:LCG. Using the preset decks against the first scenario. 

Game 1
Tactics and Lore
Took forever! Much longer than I expected at around 2.5 hours. Bearing in mind I was learning it still seemed to drag. I couldn&#039;t get past the first quest. Only one hero died and I managed an eventual win. Not sure about the exact score as I forgot to keep track of the number of rounds. My guess is somewhere near 200. 

Game 2
Leadership and spirit
Much quicker! The first draw from the encounter deck didn&#039;t hinder my questing, so I went for it as quick as I could, completing the game within 4 rounds. Score: 123. The only thing I noticed with this combo is there didn&#039;t seem a way to restore health but I didn&#039;t get through many cards. 

Early impressions are this is a very smooth game. Having only bought the core set last week I&#039;m already considering expansions. That&#039;s before I&#039;ve even started deck building which will probably absorb as much time as playing!</body>

	<body>...because I am nothing if not determined. 

Game eight, a successful abort (yep, that built in lose condition that affords you one karma point to the survivors). I only need three such similar losses before my ork and troll can buy their first upgrade. At which point I get to have a conniption about defacing the player cards with stickers. (Still one of the dumbest design decisions of recent times; I&#039;m probably just going to be writing on a photocopy... Thank you, OCD.)

I had some decent teamwork going on, this time, and I was more confident than usual. I&#039;m beginning to enjoy this more, now I&#039;ve accepted there&#039;s a bizarre imbalance in the gameplay. I was interested to see rahdo is filming a mock-up of the designer&#039;s play through - presumably to show the game is possible to us mere mortals. I find this all rather odd, I have to admit. It feels like damage control - or brand loyalty on Richard&#039;s part... I wonder if he feels he has to defend his game of the year shout? Bit strange, I mean it&#039;s not like a typical kickstarter shill, is it?

Anyway... Made it into the third act, bought a first aid kit, healed up a point each for both characters... and would have played the health kit to heal the ork to three points, when I drew a crossfire which automatically gives everyone a wound. Ork is staggered again, before the bloody round begins. Lose your hand, draw one card on your turn. Wonderful. Sure, the crossfire card had a name and some flavour text - but let&#039;s just call it the &quot;automatic lose card&quot;. Couldn&#039;t make a single point of damage on the ork&#039;s obstacles, which then hit him for five points of damage. He goes critical, but the troll survived the abort round. 

All, of course, utterly random and unavoidable. Although &quot;random&quot; implies the luck will swing my way, some times. It hasnt yet, in eight games. </body>

I had no idea on Rahdo&#039;s mock-up, but I&#039;m thinking you&#039;re right about him trying to reconfirm how to play the game to get the enjoyment level up.  For me, I&#039;ve won quite a bit (not all the time), and that&#039;s helped to motivate me against some of the &quot;unwinnable&quot; scenarios that come up with the cards.

I&#039;m with you about writing on the cards - I stuck the stickers to chipboard and cut them out, so I just place the on the cards when I want to use them for an advanced scenario - and actually sometimes randomly draw them from a bag with a total &quot;points&quot; to spend.  That increases the enjoyment for me as well.

Glad to see you&#039;re sticking with it. :D

Rahdo is acting increasingly bafflingly these days. I still don&#039;t comprehend how he thinks this game&#039;s got more replayability than Pathfinder ACG.

It seems to me he won&#039;t admit he got this one wrong.

I stopped taking him seriously in that original video when he gushed that by upgrading to give you one more dollar at the start of each mission, it fundamentally changed the way the game played.

Really?

It&#039;s not my game of the year, but I do think Rhado likes it.

It also is a much much much better 2 player game than 4 player game.  The 2 rounds of no events really cuts down on the difficulty.

Still not a fan, though.

I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the issue we&#039;re discussing at all. 

For me, I think he&#039;s made some odd judgement calls of late - but opinions, and all that. I love his earlier videos, when it&#039;s just a man indulging in a hobby he loves (I&#039;m so grateful for his Death Angel video, for example). But once he started panhandling on kickstarter to get fans to support his hobby, I think there was a sea-change in his videos. 

Pretty much any kickstarter final thought that begins with his ubiquitous, &quot;Wow!&quot; is typically such fawning tripe that it just smacks of not biting the hand that feeds him. His ideas about telling designers how to improve their games also smacks of someone who&#039;s buying into the whole cult of himself. 

I just find it a little jarring, these days. I mean, watch one of those stooges on the home shopping channel talking about some nonsense they have to sell, for twenty minutes, then play a final thoughts for a kickstarter deal he&#039;s worked. They&#039;re nearly indistinguishable. He&#039;s become kickstarter&#039;s snake oil salesman, for me, at least.

I had no idea that Rahdo was cutting deals with kickstarter projects and then posting final thoughts as though... as though they weren&#039;t made with a conflict of interest. There&#039;s a reason the Dice Tower previews, while they lasted, and the Board Game Brawl previews now, specifically say &quot;This is a preview, we aren&#039;t giving a review.&quot; 

Granted any reviewer will get free review copies, but somehow that feels less under-the-table. Probably because at least with a free review copy, that game is published and available for public consumption, whereas with a Kickstarter everything is still... fluffy and might not even make it wherever it wants to go. 

Kickstarter is a space where reviewers need to be very careful about opinions. Very, very, very careful. Be honestly blunt, or don&#039;t bother with an opinion.

My question was a direct response to Zouave&#039;s statement that Rahdo &quot;won&#039;t admit he got this one wrong&quot;.  Rahdo says he loves the game and that it&#039;s one of his best games of all time.  He also explains why he loves the game.  Zouave says that Rahdo won&#039;t admit he got it wrong.

This seems to explicitly say that Zouave thinks that Rahdo doesn&#039;t actually love the game but is not willing to admit it?  Maybe this is reading comprehension failure on my part but I honestly don&#039;t know how to interpret that statement other than Zouave thinking that Rahdo doesn&#039;t actually like the game but is just being stubborn about it.

To be fair to Rahdo, he has always been upfront that if he dislikes a game, he will get in touch with the publisher to check if they are okay with him posting a negative video.  He has publicly stated this and there is even a thread about it somewhere here on BGG.  Given this, I don&#039;t find it surprising at all that all (or at least, the overwhelming majority) of his videos are positive.  Particularly for a Kickstarter game, I don&#039;t see any of the publishers agreeing to let him publish a negative video and negatively impact the KS just as it launches.

The other way I view it is to look at the kinds of games that he gushes about.  The games he likes are generally in the Euro style (versus AT style) and his preference seems to be for strong mechanics which encourage lots of tough decisions.  By way of example, while I have never played Shadows of Brimstone, what I have read about it would tell me that Rahdo would probably dislike the game (the only possible saving grace for him might be the level up campaign mechanics which he seems to love).  Granted, this isn&#039;t a given as he has liked some AT games in the past but its very clear that he generally prefers Euro style games.  And sure enough, most of the KS games he gushes about are Euro style.

As to him giving his thoughts on what to change to improve the game.  His background is that of video game development.  Is it any surprise he has lots of opinions on how games (albeit tabletop games in this case) should be developed?

I hear what you are saying (at least, I think I do).  I just don&#039;t see any of your points as being extraordinary or surprising given his background and likes/dislikes.

[q=&quot;BilboAtBagEnd&quot;][q=&quot;Jokemeister&quot;][q=&quot;BilboAtBagEnd&quot;]I had no idea that Rahdo was cutting deals with kickstarter projects and then posting final thoughts as though... as though they weren&#039;t made with a conflict of interest. There&#039;s a reason the Dice Tower previews, while they lasted, and the Board Game Brawl previews now, specifically say &quot;This is a preview, we aren&#039;t giving a review.&quot; 

Granted any reviewer will get free review copies, but somehow that feels less under-the-table. Probably because at least with a free review copy, that game is published and available for public consumption, whereas with a Kickstarter everything is still... fluffy and might not even make it wherever it wants to go. 

Kickstarter is a space where reviewers need to be very careful about opinions. Very, very, very careful. Be honestly blunt, or don&#039;t bother with an opinion. [/q]

As far as I know, he isn&#039;t getting paid to do reviews of Kickstarter projects (outside of getting a copy of the game).  

If he is getting paid, then he needs to improve his disclosure because I didn&#039;t know (Captain Obvious - reporting for duty!).[/q]

I certainly hope he isn&#039;t getting paid, I would feel very sad. He&#039;s done a lot for the hobby.[/q]

I thumbed this because I would also be sad.  

However, I wanted to clarify that I would only be sad because it wasn&#039;t clearly disclosed.  I personally don&#039;t mind the idea of him doing paid previews.  As long as its clearly disclosed, I have no issues whatsoever (although I would completely disregard his preview if it was paid).

Also, when I say clearly disclosed, I mean that it must be clearly stated at the start of each individual video.  Not just a general statement somewhere else that he is doing paid previews or a comment that it was a paid preview in the youtube notes.

Edit: Also, any other potential conflicts of interest should be clearly stated upfront.  For example, publisher paid an all expenses trip for him to travel to the studio to play the game.  Obviously, this doesn&#039;t happen much with KS previews but it is only meant to be an illustrative example.

Just for sake of clarity, the phrase &quot;cutting deals&quot; wasn&#039;t intended to imply that I thought he was getting cash and so forth. (Although I don&#039;t know either way.) That seems to be the line that got jumped on. 

I read &quot;won&#039;t admit he got it wrong&quot; not as him refusing to admit he doesn&#039;t like it - not at all - but that when he enthuses about how brilliantly it all works and the intricate balance, etc., that he&#039;s wrong about that.

Ten games in, I can&#039;t beat the tutorial. Many others have screamed it isn&#039;t effectively play-tested, long before that threshold. Of course, none of us may be right... but his illustrative videos of &quot;this is how the designer is playing it - and winning&quot; smacks of bullshit (on the designer&#039;s part) because they can stack the deck any way they like. I&#039;m curious why he feels the need to add to the &quot;spin&quot; on this one.

The game was supposed to be random (other than the starting position).  With that said, he did get some really good luck (eg an ineffective crossfire card).

Was the deck stacked?  I don&#039;t know but I&#039;m prepared to cut the designer some slack and take him at his word that the deck was random.  Regardless of whether the deck was truly random or not, the entire thread was an interesting read to see his rationale around why he did what he did as well as the other thoughts/discussion of other players in that thread.

As to why Rahdo is adding to the &quot;spin&quot; - he has commented on his videos before that he is constantly on the games forums defending the game (not his exact words) so maybe he felt this was just a continuation of that.

Since I believe he chose the objectives to start with, it&#039;s not out of the realm of possibility that he stacked the deck. 

But even if not, it does show that luck is important to winning. Probably more so than decisions a lot of the time.

[q=&quot;repairmanjack&quot;]I find this all rather odd, I have to admit. It feels like damage control - or brand loyalty on Richard&#039;s part... I wonder if he feels he has to defend his game of the year shout? Bit strange, I mean it&#039;s not like a typical kickstarter shill, is it?[/q]
Actually the reason I did it was because I had previously told some folks who were having a really hard time ever winning (or even aborting) that if I could find some time, I&#039;d spend an afternoon filming myself playing game after game until I get a win to demonstrate how it&#039;s doable (I win about 30% of the time).  

When I saw the publisher demo, I figured that was even better, because it would be full of strategy tips that are better than what I could give :)  Considering that the devs (who are true experts at the game) win over 90% of the time at any player count with no upgrades, their advice is probably a bit more useful than mine! :)

[q=&quot;kittenhoarder&quot;]Rahdo is acting increasingly bafflingly these days. I still don&#039;t comprehend how he thinks this game&#039;s got more replayability than Pathfinder ACG.[/q]
Comparing what comes in in a $40 box of Pathfinder vs a $40 box of Shadowrun, I think there&#039;s no comparison, personally.  Pathfinder is designed to encourage you to continue buying more and more new modules to get replayability. Shadowrun is designed to give you tons of replay right out of the box.  I prefer the latter, definitely, though I did really enjoy Pathfinder until I discovered my character has a shelf life, which for me limited replayability even more :)

[q=&quot;Zouave&quot;]I stopped taking him seriously in that original video when he gushed that by upgrading to give you one more dollar at the start of each mission, it fundamentally changed the way the game played.

Really?[/q]
Yes, really.  Really really, in fact :)

[q=&quot;repairmanjack&quot;]Pretty much any kickstarter final thought that begins with his ubiquitous, &quot;Wow!&quot; is typically such fawning tripe that it just smacks of not biting the hand that feeds him.[/q]
How does it feed me though?  I don&#039;t get paid for any videos by publishers, at all.  The reason my videos are positive is because I only make videos of games I like.  For every positive KS game I cover, there&#039;s at least 10 other projects that I said &quot;no&quot; to because I knew I wouldn&#039;t enjoy them and therefore didn&#039;t want to take the time to learn, play and film them.

[q]His ideas about telling designers how to improve their games also smacks of someone who&#039;s buying into the whole cult of himself. [/q]
Believe me, that&#039;s not the case at all.  It&#039;s why I repeatedly say in my videos that people should completely ignore my opinion and draw their own conclusions based on the gameplay vids I do.  Nothing makes me happier than the fact that only 50% of the folks who watch Rahdo Runs Through ever bother with final thoughts vids.  I&#039;d be ecstatic if that percentage got down to 0% :)

[q]I just find it a little jarring, these days. I mean, watch one of those stooges on the home shopping channel talking about some nonsense they have to sell, for twenty minutes, then play a final thoughts for a kickstarter deal he&#039;s worked. They&#039;re nearly indistinguishable. He&#039;s become kickstarter&#039;s snake oil salesman, for me, at least. [/q]
Sorry you feel that way, but again, I&#039;m only sharing my genuine enthusiasm for games that I enjoy, and unlike QVC folks, I&#039;m not getting paid by the maker of the product to say what I say. 

[q=&quot;BilboAtBagEnd&quot;]I had no idea that Rahdo was cutting deals with kickstarter projects and then posting final thoughts as though... as though they weren&#039;t made with a conflict of interest.[/q]
That&#039;s because I don&#039;t cut any deals.  I receive nothing for the videos I do.  More often than not, I don&#039;t even get a final copy of the game (just making do with the prototypes I receive).  I do those videos totally for free (and for the record, I&#039;m just about the only video reviewer out there who doesn&#039;t get paid for KS videos, and have taken heat from other reviewers in the past for making things tougher for them when they do ask for payments while I do it gratis).  

As an aside, I also don&#039;t turn on ads for my videos either, which is probably $5000/year I don&#039;t receive in ad revenues, because I think youtube ads suck .  AFAIK, I&#039;m the only video reviewer who takes this stance as well :)

[q=&quot;repairmanjack&quot;]Just for sake of clarity, the phrase &quot;cutting deals&quot; wasn&#039;t intended to imply that I thought he was getting cash and so forth. (Although I don&#039;t know either way.)[/q]
All is revealed here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1023680/full-disclosure

[q]I read &quot;won&#039;t admit he got it wrong&quot; not as him refusing to admit he doesn&#039;t like it - not at all - but that when he enthuses about how brilliantly it all works and the intricate balance, etc., that he&#039;s wrong about that.[/q]
Well, IMO, I think I&#039;m right.  The fact that the designers can win 90% of the time when they play proves (unless one thinks they&#039;re lying) that the game is more about skill than random luck.  Random luck killing you means you made moves earlier in the game that led you to be unprepared for those events.  In the strategy video I posted, in the final wave, one of the worst crossfire cards in the game got drawn, and they shrugged it off as no big deal, because they were prepared because of earlier strategic moves he made :)

[q]Ten games in, I can&#039;t beat the tutorial. Many others have screamed it isn&#039;t effectively play-tested, long before that threshold. Of course, none of us may be right... but his illustrative videos of &quot;this is how the designer is playing it - and winning&quot; smacks of bullshit (on the designer&#039;s part) because they can stack the deck any way they like.[/q]
The designer made clear that he did *not* stack the deck at all... in fact, he actually increased the difficulty by drawing a bunch of different starting obstacles and picking the toughest combination that came up.  

[q]I&#039;m curious why he feels the need to add to the &quot;spin&quot; on this one.[/q]
How do you mean?

You know, I gotta give you huge props for that. It crossed my mind recently that I expected you to be doing that. As someone who recently started doing videos, it also crossed my mind what would I do if one day I got big enough with 1,000s of subscribers - would I monetize my Youtube stuff? Gotta be tempting, especially as I had no idea it could be $5,000, but I also think those ads suck. But that won&#039;t happen most likely as I&#039;m focusing on solitaire games and not doing the cult of the new stuff you need to do to get hugely popular. 

And while I&#039;m here, when I was starting out last fall, I emailed you and Joel E. with some newb video question about what camera you use. Joel got back and was extremely helpful whereas you didn&#039;t reply. You seem pretty down to earth and like the type who&#039;s not protective of turf, so I chalked it up to not checking your geekmail, but FYI a short reply to help out a newb would&#039;ve been cool. Or maybe you stated somewhere you don&#039;t reply to questions like that and I missed it.

OMG, I&#039;m really sorry about that.  Yeah, I must have totally missed it some how, as I *always* strive to answer every question asked of me anywhere (geekmail, forums, reddit, youtube, facebook, twitter, g+, email, etc.)  I end up spending probably at least a couple hours every day answering questions, and I *often* answer that very question you were asking, because I get asked a lot!

Very sorry, again, it must have slipped between the cracks!  To answer now, I&#039;ve got a sony pj650 that I hold in my hand, a no-name lapel mic that cost Â£20 on ebay clipped to my shirt, and a panasonic tm90 that got dropped (and now can&#039;t autofocus well) set up on the side as my static cam.  For any editing I ever have to do, I use youtube&#039;s built in editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor) which is awful (especially as it has no undo feature) and so I never really do any editing.  For the few times that I record stuff on a PC (like my recent [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBTMmxOTVtM]top10 anticipated games of 2015[/url] vid) I use a trial version of Camtasia Studio :)

edit: i just searched my geekmail archives (I never delete any emails - i&#039;ve got 104 pages of old messages), but i didn&#039;t find your original message.  is there any chance you sent it to rahdorunsthrough, which was an account i created once but never used, and have since deleted?

anyway, sorry about the seeming snub.  Answering folks questions is hugely important to me, but I guess some of them slip through the cracks in spite of my best efforts! :(

Feb 03 - First game, so I decided not to add in the expansions just to get a feel for the basic rules and to also have that comparison. I look forward to seeing how much better the expansions do add, since it felt a bit meh. I was overwhelmed with blights, and blame that on the team I had (randomly chosen) as I was just not able to do much with them.

The last time I sat down to play this game, I lost three times in 20 minutes. It was over so fast, I only counted them as one play in my log. Tonight, I got through the deck for the first time. Woot! And I missed a Minor Victory by 1 VP. So close! Instead, I end with a Standoff (a draw, basically).

[ImageID=2403358medium]

Of course, I&#039;m wondering what I did wrong this time to have actually made it through the deck. And then I wonder...do I even want to figure out what it might be?! I had fun, and that&#039;s what I was looking for when I picked up this game.

Zulus can be randomly punishing, so you need to know that going in, or you&#039;ll just end up as a ball of frustration, lying in the corner, shaking. Between the chit draw and the dice for resolution, it can get ugly. I mean, [b]twice[/b], I rolled [i]five[/i] dice for combat and only had [i]one[/i] success. Grrrr.

Overall, I do like the game and actually getting to play the whole thing was really nice. Typical Gold Banner components from VPG with thick tokens and standees. The cards don&#039;t have much in the way of artwork, but the historical text is really interesting and improves the experience, IMO.

[ImageID=2403359medium]

The game is about management...of your cards and the four tracks the iButhos follow. You need to decide when to use a normal Volley or when to sacrifice one of your Heroes to stay alive. Using the special actions of the Heroes as much as you can before their time comes is key.

And, of course, a semi-favorable chit draw at the start of your turn doesn&#039;t hurt either. That was a major difference between tonight&#039;s play and the last one. Here, I had a nice mix of movement chits in the early game.  Whereas the last time, I had the same track moving multiple spaces every turn.

It&#039;s a good game. You just have to be ready for a potentially random game experience. But when it comes together for you, it makes a great time at the game table.

I agree it can be a bit random and sometimes it&#039;s over quickly but it plays so fast and reset is so quick that makes up for it.

Yep!  I have four of them actually.  I posted a pic a few months ago.  I can probably find it again.  Anyway, yes I use them for any chit/cube/token pull mechanism in games like this or Snowdonia or Village or Eldritch Horror, etc. 

Much, much easier than a bag.  

I found them at Target for $1 a piece.  They were in that front, junky section right inside the entrance.

I know that section quite well. I thought maybe they came from a restaurant that lets you throw peanuts on the floor. :laugh:

[q=&quot;garyrbrooks&quot;]I agree it can be a bit random and sometimes it&#039;s over quickly but it plays so fast and reset is so quick that makes up for it.

Your write up makes me want to play it again. One I enjoy.[/q]
I&#039;ve only played a handful of times so far, but I can see that randomness getting a bit in the way of enjoying the game.  That previous session with three quick plays seemed like such a waste of time.  But then this play was so enjoyable.  There was a lot of back and forth with the iButho tracks.  Twice, the Regroup chit came out just as I was under extreme duress, giving me just enough time to put together a solid attack the next turn.  It was really, really good this time.  I hope to see more of those types of plays than the previous.

	<body>I brought this back to the table as I felt like running up a tech tree tonight.  I was able to score 64 points - 2 shy of the highest winning condition.  In general I think the scaling of the final scores needs to be adjusted slightly - my first play was at the highest winning condition; so between the few times I&#039;ve played it I&#039;ve always finished 1st or 2nd in rankings.  I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s even possible to score a novice of 20 - perhaps I&#039;ll try to see the minimum points I can score to get through the game next time ;)</body>

	<body>I played a solo game of this 2-handed without the solo variant that&#039;s posted on the geek, as I received this in trade and didn&#039;t have the additional &quot;spare&quot; blank tokens that would have come with the game - I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll come up with another substitute for that in the future.

In general the game played really well -and at one point it looked like I had a big gap / runaway with one of the players, but in the end the score differential was only 1 point - and that&#039;s something that I understood the game to be - a very tight, non-random experience.

Overall I was quite satisfied with my first play of the game and will try to fit in a few more over the coming months (if only all the shoveling wasn&#039;t taking up my game time!).</body>

I scored a 17. With 16 cash. I was penalized at the last for not satisfying a regular customer. I kind of abandoned my 4 customers at the end to satisfy as many of the casual customers as I could.

	<body>First playing yesterday... Still scraping the gore out of my hair.

Played the intro scenario and the darkness managed to escape because it took so long for the clue tokens to come out. Nonetheless I managed to scrape enough XP together to just get enough for a level-up, mainly by taking out a couple of large creatures.

Love the idea of going to town between scenarios, but is it me or is that part of the game incredibly fiddly and under-explained?

Used the excellent printerstudio gold certificates and hero upgrade cards.

My only real gripe is about needing to write stuff down when you forge a darkstone upgrade at the blacksmith and stuff like that.

Fantastic game though.

I really like the encounters, which may or may not provoke a fight.</body>

This game is truly a blast.

I have said it before here, but you should really check out the [filepage=111247]Hexcrawl[/filepage] campaign variant. Really elevates this game by introducing a map with unique towns and mines. Each town has distinct features, and buildings that get destroyed in a given town stay destroyed. Adds a pandemic type overall goal of sealing the mines on the map, leading to a final showdown in brimstone. Well worth it. Now that I have started into it, I can&#039;t imagine playing this game without it.

I&#039;ve assembled and punched both sets but I really need to paint all the minis to get the most out of this game.

My worst painting experience was painting all the minis for [thing=9609][/thing], playing it once, not liking it and then trading it.

The map is definitely a version of the one from the scenario book.

I ended up with a 15 and 6 gold remaining.  I had TONS of fun with this one.  Really should have picked it up earlier.

So I need to get this back to the table and what better way than a challenge!

Whoo Hoo! :D My highest ever solo score in Snowdonia!

I misjudged the contents of the bag at the end, and could have pulled resources out using a contract card which would have given me the coal to use to get my worker out of the pub. That would have enabled me to push my surveyor to the top of the mountain on the last turn, which would have given me the extra 6 points and would have meant I&#039;d broken the 200 mark!

:thumbsup:  Plays wonderfully solo, with no major change to the gameplay

:thumbsup: Each game is different due to the changing weather and the different appearance times of the event cubes, which act as a game timer

:thumbsup: Has 7 different &#039;locomotives&#039; and two different scenarios in the base game, and the game is supported by a growing number of additional scenarios and expansions

:thumbsdown: Can&#039;t think of any offhand....... Great game! :thumbsup:

[b]Edit[/b]
I followed this game up by play testing a potential solo variant against a &#039;bot&#039; player. It needs refining but I&#039;d say that after two plays, it is working nicely and it feels like you&#039;re playing a real player....

Nice score, Dave!  Sounds like it could have been even better, but 197 is nothing to scoff at.  :D

The &#039;bot player sounds interesting, but so far, the &quot;normal&quot; solo game has been so satisfying for me, I&#039;m not sure I would need one.  However, I do know many solo gamers don&#039;t enjoy the straight up high score solo games, so that may be what they would need to enjoy this fine specimen of gaming goodness.

Keep us informed!

I won on the 5th game, I think.

The swap action is really important!  It&#039;s what I used every time, almost constantly, in my wins.  Also, choosing which side you put the bad cards matters, as you can often swap them around easily to counter each other out.

Efficiency of actions is the key.  Being able to do more than one thing with a single action = winning. :)

	<body>I&#039;ll go into more detail below on different aspects that I want to talk about. This was a session on Easy with the scenario Misdirection. The base was destroyed at the end of Round 3, which was way too early again.

I&#039;m fine with the rules now, but the strategy is eluding me, especially with regards to keeping up the Soldier reserves (and consequently Funding).

[u]The short of it[/u]
:thumbsup: Awesome game, even if you get it just for solitaire play, with plenty of replayability.
:thumbsdown: Strategy is eluding me.
:thumbsdown: Intimidated by the prospect of painting the Soldiers.

[u]The long of it[/u]
[b]Thoughts on Painting[/b]
I suppose it was unavoidable that at some point I would try my hand at painting mini&#039;s again. In my long gaming history, I have started up and subsequently abandoned a handful of painting projects. The last one was some three or four years ago, when I bought Blood Bowl and a whole bunch of paints, brushes and accessories for painting up that game.

Though I sold off Blood Bowl, I held on to those supplies. I must say that the Citadel paints are of such high quality, that they are still as good as they were the day I bought them. They are a mix of the old and new line, and contain the right colours to start off easy with the Interceptors.

[center][ImageID=2403812medium][/center]
I used a white primer, Chainmail base coat, Nuln Oil wash, and Longbeard Grey drybrush. I&#039;m satisfied with the result, though I was (re)learning as I went along. The Interceptors don&#039;t &quot;pop&quot; as much as I would like them to, but they certainly have a lot more definition compared to when they were unpainted.

So now on to the possibly even easier UFO&#039;s, which I will paint red. And then I&#039;ll have to see what I do with the Soldiers. There is a lot of detail on them, and even if I go the easier route and keep most of the body in the same color, painting face and hair details terrifies me. We&#039;ll see.

[b]Thoughts on Tablespace[/b]
I game a lot in the living room, using an 80x60cm board and sometimes an additional side table. I can get most games played that way. [thing=163602]XCOM[/thing] is no exception, though I learned a lot running through the Tutorial about how to best organize the game.

[center][ImageID=2403811medium][/center]
Even when playing the Tutorial, I already left the Role Summary cards in the box. And after finishing it, I realized there is no point in using even the larger Reserve cards. The individual Roles become meaningless when playing solitaire. And it freed me up to organize the components in such a way that I can get to what I need, when I need it. That&#039;s crucial for running through the Timed phase as efficiently as possible.

In that regard, the limited tablespace helps me organize the components. I use the gameboard for quite a few of them, like Satellites and Scientists on the Base space, UFO&#039;s above the Recruitment box, Credit tokens in the Recruitment box, and Interceptors next to the scenario box. Enemy and Crisis decks are also on the gameboard.

Then next to the gameboard, closest to me, are all the things that are needed during the Timed Phase. I do use the Squad Leader Reserve cards, because they contain the matching Task symbols for the four different Soldier types. Other than that, besides two draw decks (Tech and Missions), I just lay out the Asset and Tech cards for the Timed Phase at my edge of the playing area. Resolution phase cards go up top, and I even stack them after using them, so that they don&#039;t distract me. This setup is working fine for me now, though I may make a tweak or two.

[b]Thoughts on Gameplay[/b]
This is easy: I love this game. It&#039;s beating me up, but I love the challenge. There is inherent replayability right there for me, as I learn how to get better at this game. There is a strong resource management aspect to this game. Funds convert to units of different types, and managing the flow of those funds and units, is something that I need to learn. Besides getting to grips with the resource management aspect, there is a lot of replayability in the base game itself: 4 difficulty levels (excluding the Tutorial) and 5 scenario&#039;s to choose from.

On top of the resource management is the typical FFG stuff: mounting tension on different fronts, randomness from card draws and die rolls (though for especially the latter there are many Tech cards that help you manage the results), and great components. It isn&#039;t much different from many of their other games, in that it throws anything it can at you, the player, to make you lose your balance, slip up, and fall.

[b]Thoughts on the App[/b]
Where FFG would normally use decks of cards to lace a game with unpredictability, they created an app. It does basically two things: Create tension by having the player perform various actions on a clock, thereby increasing chances for mistakes. Those mistakes won&#039;t be fatal, and I don&#039;t know yet how they actually effect the game, but they do have an effect. So far I suspect on diminishing Funds and a growing number of Crises (which can be utterly brutal).

The second thing the app does, is supporting said unpredictability with an obfuscated layer of adaptability. At the end of a Round, you have to input certain aspects of the game state, and the app takes that information, no doubt with a dollop of randomness, to determine what comes out during the Timed Phase in the following Round. I don&#039;t care how exactly that works. All I know is that it works, and it&#039;s a whole lot of fun. And there is no way that this could be done with physical components, without adding huge amounts of overhead in both components, cost and gametime.

On Easy mode the Timed Phase gave me plenty of time. Only once did I run out, but as I understand it there are no additional consequences when running out of time. In Normal mode the game won&#039;t be so lenient on me, but I will only attempt it when I have won at least once on Easy mode. The Timed Phase is stressful, but I can handle it, because the game as a whole is so much fun to play.

Lastly, the App is very well designed. I have run it on my Android smartphone, and everything was legible and clear. It&#039;s even better on a tablet (an iPad in the playing area picture). I have had no problems with looking up rules in the app, and I think it would be completely illogical to have a full printed rulebook when they can easily update the rules and FAQ in the app. The Tutorial is brilliant, and besides looking up a few details then, I haven&#039;t been back into the rules during this whole session.

[b]Thoughts on the App - A Short Rant Against Haters[/b]
I have to get this off my chest. If people don&#039;t like the idea of having to use a digital component with their analogue boardgaming, fine. It&#039;s their right to stay away from games that have a digital component, whether it be this one or another. It&#039;s clear to me that in this case XCOM is a boardgame first and foremost. I have explained what the app does, and it does it well. It supports a boardgame in ways that physical components practically speaking couldn&#039;t. FFG has also made clear that XCOM is a boardgame, which is why it has cards, plastic and cardboard in abundance.

If some people stay away from this game and other games like it, regardless of what the app does and how this [i]board[/i]game works and plays, fine. But, then stay away from it! Don&#039;t come onto the forums complaining about how this isn&#039;t a boardgame, and this is the end of boardgaming with physical components and whatnot. The most obnoxious offenders are those that rate the game a 1 just because XCOM has a digital component. That is moronic. Those ratings should be removed, and the perpetrators banned (I&#039;d settle for temporary bans).

[b]Closing Thoughts[/b]
As I said, so far I love this game. I have no history with the videogame, and having knowledge of it may actually be a handicap. Because see, here is what the genius, conceptually, of XCOM The Board Game is: FFG has taken a turn-based tactical videogame, and turned into a real-time grand strategic boardgame. With a digital component. That takes guts. And design savvy (which FFG has in abundance). And normally I don&#039;t even like alien-themed games!

Though I might play XCOM once or twice with others, this game is perfect for only solitaire play.
Go out and get it. And post on the [b][geeklist=166714]SGOYT made me buy this geeklist[/geeklist][/b]. ;)</body>

Sorry, but it&#039;s the fact that the digital component is REQUIRED that blurs the lines too much.

Assistance apps are great, but required fusion of the two is not.  They should have just moved the board stuff into the app and let you play it all there.

I&#039;m sure for those that don&#039;t mind looking at their screen and having noises and timers and whatnot disrupting their board game, then fine.  But really, don&#039;t tell people  what they can and cannot say and for what reasons.  if I were to troll into the X-COM BGG forums and repeatedly criticize it, that would be wrong.  But when it&#039;s brought out for discussion in a community, then the whole community should have a right to discuss it.

If YOU hate discussion, then YOU should not post it here in the SGOYT lists.  (see how it feels)[/-]

I&#039;m not a &quot;hater&quot;... I&#039;ve taken a reasoned and measured assessment of what the situation is and offered an opinion.

P.S. I was enjoying your review until the tirade.

P.P.S  As an example, the FFG Star Wars Dice app is a great example of blending the technologies. It&#039;s a convenient way to store, roll, and tabulate sets of dice.  Not required, but beneficial.

Thank you for your clarifications.

I have not rated X-COM at all, however, I do feel it is a completely valid position to do so.  If you don&#039;t like a game for whatever reason, even enough not to even buy or play the game, then the rating is a way to express that.

The campaign should not be to ban people who rate games a 1 for reasons you disagree with, it should be to augment the ratings system to include a &quot;Have you played this game&quot; and &quot;Have you owned this game&quot; or even better  change the rating to two parts:  &quot;Rate your interest in playing this game.&quot; and &quot;After playing rate the game.&quot;

I&#039;d love to go and rate Mage Knight and others with a &quot;1&quot; for their fantasy/magic theme, because that is a fair rating of how I feel about those games.  But I don&#039;t, just to be a good sport.

I suppose I can&#039;t expect everyone to be a good sport, like you, but I am glad you are. :) I wholeheartedly agree with you that the ratings system lacks in that regard, in say an &quot;anticipation&quot; rating. That would help tremendously, and avoid gut reaction dislike of a game clouding the actual rating. As you say, there is little other way to express such dislike.

It&#039;s funny that you mention the Dice App. I actively avoid using such apps, because I love the physicality of rolling dice, regardless of their encumbrance. This may sound paradoxical, given my staunch support of XCOM and its app, but it does for me stress the point of XCOM being a boardgame first and foremost, in my opinion. I would have no interest in it if the whole game was in a digital form, and I very rarely play any boardgames digitally.

For me one of the biggest draws of a boardgame is precisely that physicality, the feel of different types of components, flipping cards, rolling dice, moving bits and pieces around. What XCOM does is enhance tension and unpredictability, which I personally find very important aspects in boardgames, in a manner that would otherwise have been almost impossible to achieve. It doesn&#039;t detract at all from the fun that playing a boardgame gives me.

Agreed completely on boardgames in general.  I only came back a couple of years ago and for real about 15 months ago.  Didn&#039;t know they&#039;d stuck around except for the box store variety.  I was an all the time PC gamer.  Since getting back to the physical aspect, I&#039;ve uninstalled most of my Steam apps and am rarely tempted to buy the &quot;new great game&quot; on the PC.  And when tempted, rarer still do I even buy it. 

That said, I do love the tactile feeling of boardgames.  It&#039;s relaxing.  I love the therapeutic nature of painting minis too.  I work with a computer all day, so when my hobby was that too, I felt a little disconnected.  Now I feel &quot;in touch&quot; with things again.

However, that&#039;s what I don&#039;t like about the app being required.  Just when I get more analog, the digital is an unwelcome invader, that to use the X-COM analogy, has to be hunted down and exterminated.  Were it something I could invite onto my table as an add-on or convenience, that would be awesome, because I could still play the game without it.

There is no way the app fits into my gaming time/world, even if I wanted it to.  I play quietly and concentrate on the board and the physical components.  I can keep the game experience contained to MY hands and MY imagination.  I don&#039;t have to project it to my wife and son or anyone else in the house.

Like I said elsewhere, Space Alert&#039;s CD eliminates that game for me too.   

The better solution for FFG would have been to make the app optional, even if the physical version were inferior to the app usage.  It would at least allow more people to play the game instead of putting up an &quot;our way or the highway&quot; wall.

Their choice to force this on gamers using an highly anticipated property was wise and stupid at the same time.

Wise in that the desire to play X-COM might be enough to get some people over the hurdle.  Stupid in that do many would be interested in X-COM, but not the app requirement that that complaints of people being unable to play the game would be louder.

I&#039;m not a &quot;hater&quot; (man, that&#039;s an overused term) but I&#039;m a bit...leery at the whole idea of a required app. When I buy a game, I want to use it for a good long time and given FFG&#039;s long-term support for games they are no longer excited about (hi, Fury of Dracula, how ya doin&#039;, Gears of War?), I&#039;m not sure about this games&#039; prospects farther down the road. I&#039;ve been burned by DRM issues with other media and I&#039;m not thrilled by the idea that a $60 boardgame just &quot;won&#039;t work anymore&quot; because FFG pulls support for it.

Fortunately, there are bunches of other games to play. Gamin&#039; on...

Agreed on this point. 20 or 30 years from now will you still be able to play XCOM? You can still play Ambush! or Magic Realm or B-17.

I appreciate the report on gameplay as I&#039;ve been curious for both coop and solo play. I&#039;m staying out of the philosophical battle as I&#039;m not fired up enough to care one way or another. It&#039;s a hybrid and easy enough for me to avoid if I don&#039;t want it.

I haven&#039;t played the game but I feel that FFG knows what they are doing in terms of making this app. I don&#039;t know if the core game really needs an app; yes, perhaps a few subtleties would be impossible but I believe that even an adaptive AI could be created using a deck of cards. Think of the Aging Deck in [thing=43570][/thing] and how that simple concept could be expanded upon in a game like this. However, I do feel FFG really designed the app well because they are quite aware that they have to convince the Luddites that it fits in well. 

The good thing the app does, at face value, is minimize fiddliness. Sometimes, the thought of setting up Gears of War dissuades me due to building the AI Deck pregame.

My big worry about this app is that a lot of boardgame companies, including FFG themselves, will see it as the hottest new thing and force it in, or worse, use it as a crutch rather than being creative about coming up with a solution. Kinda like what many zombie games (and movies) have been doing.

I would buy this game if not for my FFG boycott because I love a good platespinning co-op but I think I&#039;ll scratch my XCOM itch by playing the videogame.

Played another session, Easy, Occupation scenario. This one went down to the wire, 8 Rounds in. In the seventh Round I had a distinct chance of completing the Final Mission, but I lost two Elites on the second Task, despite a reroll. In Round 8 UFO&#039;s were hitting me hard and I couldn&#039;t avoid a second continent going into Panic. Which happens before trying to resolve the Final Mission, as I found out.

	<body>This is my third play of this game since I got it at X-Mas.

The sadistic mage and the overly heroic warrior set on the quest to reach Doomrock and slay the evil within...

The first encounter was against the Exploding Tomatoes. Only the mage survived the encounter. But that is enough and the warrior was quickly back on his feet.

The heroes continued to venture forth and in the second encounter they faced the The Wraiths of Doom. The heroes managed to kill the boss and all the whisps vanished. Moving on the the final encounter.... 

The heroes reached Doomrock, and the final encounter was revealed. The Dragon and it&#039;s allies, the Exploding Tomatoes (again!). The heroes were confident for the battle. Throughout their journey both of them leveled up twice and obtained some pretty nasty items... The mage wore a Leather Armor of Doom and a Demoniac Charm of Impending Doom. On his right hand he had the Wand of Doom (so many Doom&#039;s in this game :)) and on his left he had the Forceward of Exploding Heads. The warrior was also fully equipped. He wore the Inappropriate Armor of Backflips, the Ring of Strange Possibilities and held the Demonic Axe of Random Deaths.

The battle started. The heroes were hit pretty badly, but the Dragon was slain at the beginning of the second round. However, the Exploding Tomatoes were too many, and eventually overrun the brave heroes...

This was a great adventure, although I lost. The game is awesome! The combat phase is very strategic and a lot of fun. And in the adventuring phase you really feel the pressure because you have a limited time and you must reach Doomrock for the final encounter.

So, here are my likes and dislikes:

:thumbsup: Combat is very strategic, rewarding and fun!
:thumbsup: I really love the sense of humor of the cards. In many occasions the flavor text just makes me laugh.
:thumbsdown: The game is hard (not a negative for me, but can be for some people).
:thumbsdown: A game can take up to 3 hours if you are able to reach the final encounter (again, not really a negative aspect, but some people may be turned downed by this).</body>

This one is an absolute gem, best game of 2014 for me. :)

The game takes itself seriously, but the flavor text is really humorous and adds to the absurdity of the situations that your plucky heroes are faced with.

In my opinion it adds to the game. It&#039;s like having a crazy adventure were you can have a massage by elfs, eat visionary mushroom, rob shops and loot volunteers!

Noble Knight is supposedly getting a shipment soon.

The humor absolutely adds to the game, in my opinion.

	<body>(Played using 2nd edition of Nuts! rules.  Not the best rules, and would prefer to use updated rules, but I use what I&#039;ve got.)

What a unbelievable disaster!

I started on the south side of the map, (US1 starting zone), sneaking through the Bocage, hoping to crawl through the high grass in the center of the table to get close to the telephone building after dispatching PEF 1 (hopefully silently).  The PEF turned out to be a 4-man squad milling about in their own Bocage, each looking in a different direction.  Then, what luck, two more American paratroopers wander on board directly behind them!  Of course, it ruined my chance at stealth as the two Germans pointed that way opened fire, taking one OOF and stunning the other.

Using the surprise, we crawled to the other side of the Bocage and found ourselves in a nicely dug ditch which saved us from incoming fire.  We took shots at the other two and realized just how low in ammo we were (so...many....1s....).  One was stunned, the other dove into the tall grass and fell prone, hiding from us.  We watched helplessly as the other two finished off the remaining surprise reinforcement paratrooper, as we finished off their own downed man.  

With a brief instant of time, we dashed forward and dove into the tall grass ourselves, nary inches in front of our enemy.  Luckily we seemed to startle him as the nose of his gun fired into the dirt and we made quick work of him.  At this point, we noticed the six men pour out of the telephone building, taking position in the ditches around it, taking as many sightlines as possible.  Exchanging glances with my compatriots, we started deciding that maybe this wasn&#039;t such a good idea when 7(!) men poured out of a nearby building and began marching up the street to flank the roadway and protect all the lines.  We began cautiously retreating, hoping to draw no attention.

When the large caliber machine gun team began setting up at the end of the road, I think I heard someone mutter &quot;Brilliant idea, genius&quot; as we left by the way we came.  With only one grenade to our name, we knew we wouldn&#039;t be able to deal with 18 men in defensive positions.

This is NOT an easy campaign.

:thumbsup: Plays like a RPG, so much story comes out of any THW.
:thumbsdown: Vague rulesystem has you filling in a lot of blanks yourself (I&#039;m sure Final Version fixes this)
:thumbsdown: This campaign is, and should be, very very difficult.</body>

	<body>Hello All

First-time entry on the list.  My [b]Origin Story[/b] is fairly straightforward: as a long-time solo gamer I&#039;ve always enjoyed scoping out BGG for more solitaire goodies.  :ninja:  Imagine my delight (nay, joy!) a couple months back when I found this Geeklist and its merry band of inhabitants.  I believe I was searching some Solitaire game category but honestly don&#039;t recall the particulars.  Suffice to say, I really like the tone of this gang and feel right at home.

On to Legion of Honor. Got wind of this one through one of the monthly entries...maybe December Solitaire Games on Your Table.  I immediately fell in love with the concept, and couldn&#039;t wait to put my paws on a copy.  It was order-at-first-sight, no hesitation, pull the trigger and then stalk the the USPS/UPS delivery person every day.

When it arrived I set aside the evening (Wife: &quot;Want to watch a movie tonight?&quot;  Me: &quot;NO! Go away!&quot;) and cracked it open.  Ooooh, ahhhhh, cool components!  Look at all these intriguing charts!  There&#039;s even Rachelle counters!  

Dove into the rulebook and soon felt overwhelmed.  The garrison and campaign decks, what with Roman numerals and all that, gave me pause.  Huh?  I did some stutter steps trying to get the flow of the game, but soon it became fairly intuitive and things began to roll pretty smoothly.  Last night I wrapped up my initial, full play-through...a tale of two friends and rival grognards (Christophe and Garade) who lived to see the sad end.  Garade (always the lucky bastard!) prospered early, married well, but was shipped off to Spain - he still made comte and was ultimately the commanding general chased into southern France by the Iron Duke.  My namesake grog was gravely wounded early in his career, captured and exchanged twice, but went to Russia and rose through the ranks quickly, making Brigadier. 

:thumbsup: Once you get the hang of it the game flows well and drips immersion.  The narrative quality is fantastic - I even think I may write an in-character journal of sorts the next time I play.

:thumbsdown: The rules are not laid out the best, and there are some head-scratchers in the system, at least from a beginner&#039;s perspective.  For example, I&#039;m not sure who would ever choose the potential for disgrace over glory in a battle, but maybe that nuance will pop for me next time.

:thumbsdown: I don&#039;t care for the way duels are handled, which is via cards drawn from a special Duel deck.  Lunge, parry, riposte.  Yawn.  I&#039;m afraid I dreaded having to fight duels, given the process, and that&#039;s a no-no for a solitaire experience.

Overall, though, the game is/was a blast and I&#039;ll definitely be back in Revolutionary France again soon.</body>

Welcome aboard Chris, glad to have you here!

CoA&#039;s rule books tend to be turgid, so I tend to avoid them - this game&#039;s concept is intriguing, however.

Welcome.

Glad you feel at home.  It was the same for me too when I first posted.

There is something about SGoYT (and 1 Player Guild) that just clicked with me.

Got my copy from NWS Online - still looks to be the best price ($44.99).

It&#039;s on the table, but I got sucked into playing Borderlands 2 again by some online gaming friends so Sergent Vinaigre is still awaiting action.

	<body>So I set up Caverna late last night, intending to play it the next morning (this morning). But I looked at the boards and thought &quot;well, I&#039;ll just add the first round of resources.&quot; So I did.

And then I looked at the board and thought, &quot;It&#039;s so easy to play with two workers at the moment. I&#039;ll just take the first turn.&quot; 

And then I looked at the board and thought, &quot;Hey, maybe just one more round.&quot; 

And then it was 2am... 

I finished with a sad 47 points because I still don&#039;t understand the huge number of rooms available, and I tend to want to both adventure and farm, so life is tough for my dwarves. 

[imageid=2404008 medium]

I really should pick a strategy and stick to it, but there&#039;s so much to discover. I forgot how much because I&#039;ve before played Caverna with a variant where you reveal tiles gradually and not all of them, but the full experience is a much better game for me. 

Takes so long to set up and tear down though. I fear that a fair bit as I look at it this morning. 

Gonna have to clear it though. I need to rest my aching legs on the ottoman while I finish scripting the Core Worlds tutorial. Early this morning [thread=1314854][/thread] went up. </body>

	<body>[size=14]SGOYT ORIGIN STORY[/size]

[i]What brought you here? [/i]
It&#039;s only been 6 months, but struggling to recall, but I think is was search to unravel the obscure &#039;SGOYT&#039; acronym which would appear elsewhere in the Geek.

[i]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/i]
Zombie in my Pocket - Yes &amp; Yes, but as with most once the new-game-shine wears off, so not as much.

[i]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/i]
Aug-14&#039;s Challenge was to control both sides in a game and I had just completed a 10x10 App Play so the timing was ideal.

[i]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/i]
2P game was a loss then, and it was again for the Origin Replay.

[i]What keeps bringing you back?[/i]
Seeing what others play.
Always window shopping for more Solos.

[i]How much money have these lists cost you?[/i]
Enough - but [i]SGOYT &#039;Stopped&#039; Me Buying This[/i] has saved me more, so it all balances out.

[i][b]Solo Origin Story[/b][/i]
Always enjoyed board games - but people to play them with were infrequent.  In childhood the games available were Family Classics, such as Monopoly, Cleduo &amp; Scotland Yard.
The first self-taught game was Backgammon which allowed playing as both sides.

[i][b]Short Session Report[/b][/i]
Temple was the first room uncovered - but there were 5 zombies guarding the totem, so had to run away and try again... and it seemed all the large zombie packs were at the start of the 9pm shuffle.  Took on a couple of medium size attacks, but without weapons, so needed to rest several times.  

In the end the Grave was the last outside location - but had lost track of event cards remaining.  All that resting meant time ran out with only 1 turn needed to bury the totem :zombie:</body>

	<body>I mentioned this game to [user=reverendunclebastard][/user] in a comment and it got me thinking about it again. I&#039;m working from home, because the furnace guy is coming over (it was cold in the house this morning, let me tell ya). I had time to give this game another go over lunch.

Here is my game, when I ended:
[ImageID=2404068]

You have 60 days to find the parts to a old device before the bad guys do. Each movement within the city costs you an hour to move. You have three attributes: health, strength, and knowledge. You run out of one of them, you lose. There are some spots in the city where you can increase them but, as you can guess -- you have to give up some precious time. When you get to a spot that gives you a part, you may have to sacrifice a few of those attributes to them. There are some objects (key, map, and lens) that can help you in your quest, but they will also cost you.

The big kicker is: the city is confusing and constantly changing. Just because you went in one direction doesn&#039;t mean you can go back the way you came. Often the landmarks will change places. And, of course, as you move, the bad guys will attack you.

This particular session had me see the map early in the game, which has never happened whenever I&#039;ve played this before. I spent too much time trying to get it and kept failing (getting it lets you move 3 known spaces in a hour instead of just 1). I had to hurry to get the rest of the parts, and one (#6, for those who have played the game) also took a long time to get. I ended up fending off quite a few attacks but the city kept changing. I ended up running out of time with only one part remaining to get. But, honestly, it wasn&#039;t that close.

:thumbsup: Quick play with quite a bit of depth. 
:thumbsup: It&#039;s fun to watch the city form as you move around.
:thumbsup: Sometimes your best laid plans are thwarted easily.
:thumbsdown: Once the city is formed, though, gathering the parts you need gets to be pretty generic.
:thumbsdown: Some may find keeping track of the stats, including time, to be a bit fiddly. I find them keeping me engaged in the game but I could see that argument happening.
:thumbsdown: There is obviously more luck than strategy in this game. For me, that&#039;s what I want for a lunch time activity.

I had more :thumbsdown: than :thumbsup: above, but I still recommend this game. If it seems intriguing to you, build it up.

I got the cards from ArtsCow. Here is the link:

They are having a 20%/no shipping deal this month. See the comments for the magic code.</body>

I really like this little puzzle. Glad to see someone else post about it! I do have a nearly unbeatable strategy though: 
[o]It involves the fact that you don&#039;t &quot;have&quot; to move, read on if interested:
[o]You don&#039;t &quot;have&quot; to move (top of page 2 in the rules would imply this). So I stay put until I reveal a part and try to solve it. If I get a Cabal Attack or whatever that I can flee, I just use 2 time to move to an adjacent tile and then move back and try again. Works almost every time unless that dang #6 takes too long.[/o] [/o]

I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one. It is more puzzle than game, but wondering around the unfolding city is an immersive experience -- to me at least.

That&#039;s what I tried for the elusive 6 -- and the Map. But you do have to move (or intend to) in order for another city block to be revealed.

Also I believe once you get the part, that location stays on the board. or that&#039;s how I play.

	<body>Got this for Christmas but, per the advice here, I was waiting until I got a copy of [thing=137762]Dark City[/thing] before giving it a whirl - and also my anal-retentive sleeving (and subsequent compressing) of the cards. Finally got everything in and took the time to sleeve it over the course of a couple nights last week, so I took a whirl at my first game the other night while Denine was getting ready for bed.  I used the recommended setup for a first game, adjusted for the solo setup: Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Spidey versus The Red Skull, Hydra, and some Sentinels (?) trying to Unleash the Power of the Cosmic Cube.  Things bopped along nicely; after a few hands I decided it would be a good idea to recruit Maria Hill, to in turn recruit some heavier-hitting heroes; a few more hands and it occurred to me that I ought to focus on taking The Red Skull down a few pegs, before I burned through the villain deck and allowed him to succeed.  I forgot to draw villain cards on a couple of turns, but I think I rectified them all quickly.  Typical first game stuff.  In the end, I managed to handily defeat The Red Skull and all but one remaining villain (with a final hand that chained out to 22 attack points!) with two plot twists to spare.  I had a lot of fun playing and look forward to mixing things up now that the initial learning game is out of the way, particular getting some time with my favorite characters (Midnight Sons and X-Men, baby!).

Sorry, but I&#039;m blowing out the 1:2 rating for my first outing with this one.
:thumbsup:Absolutely love the theme!  I am a long time Marvel fanboy, about two-thirds of my life at this point, so almost all these characters are near and dear to my heart.  I know most of them really well, how they act and interact with each other, so the narrative in my head can be pretty involved.
:thumbsup:If I plan things out well the game allows me to pull off card chains that really feel like the heroes are just laying a serious beat down on the villains.
:thumbsup:I have a harder time finding themes Ren and I both like, and although she&#039;ll play pretty much anything just for the sake of playing, she&#039;s more engaged when she can get into the theme.  She&#039;s into the Marvel movies and reads some of the all-ages comics occasionally, so she has a foothold in that world.  When she saw that I&#039;d set the game up she was interested in playing, although it was already setup for solo and she didn&#039;t have time before bed anyway, but she said she definitely wants to play it.  She&#039;ll really go nuts if I buy Guardians of the Galaxy expansion, she&#039;s nuts about that movie.
:thumbsup:The iconography on the cards makes them easier to understand.  Related to the above, Ren has mild dyslexia, so I&#039;ve been reluctant to play things like Thunderstone Advance with her because the card abilities can get a little involved.  I feel a lot more confident about her ability to play Legendary without having to ask me what her cards do all the time.
:thumbsup:Dark F-ing City!  The base set has all the gold standard characters that have to be in a Marvel game - a few I&#039;d like to have, most I could take or leave, and a couple I downright don&#039;t care about (I&#039;m looking at you, [-]Marcus Johnson[/-] Nick Fury).  But Holy Cow, I love the line-up in Dark City!  Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Ghost Rider are three of my favorite heroes, and I&#039;m primarily an X-fan, so Apocalypse, Sinister, and Stryfe are at the top of my list for villains after Magneto.  Now if only they make an Exiles expansion....
:thumbsdown:What the heck is up with the divided insert?  I&#039;m sleeving with KMC Perfect Fits, so there&#039;s not a lot of bulk added, and I can barely fit Dark City in the box.  I might be able to fit one of the small expansions if it weren&#039;t for the section dividers.  Oh well, time to look at alternative organizers.
:thumbsdown:Setup is a little involved, but hopefully that will go faster once I&#039;m more familiar with what goes in the decks and not referring to two different rules to setup a solo game.


[size=12][u][b]Origin Story[/b][/u][/size]
I don&#039;t remember when exactly I was introduced to the SGOYT list, but I think it was only a month or two before [listitem=3314808]my first post[/listitem], which was a game of [thing=113924][/thing] last July.  Now clue how I came across the list, but it was probably because some game I was looking into was mentioned.  At first I felt a little out-of-place here, because I&#039;m not into military games and it seemed like the pages were dominated by those.  But I quickly figured out that there were a plenty of other dungeon-crawling, deck-building, zombie-slaying junkies around too and now this list feels like my second home (the first being the Kickstarter lists).

The only game I can think of that the list has caused me to buy that I had no intention of buying beforehand is [thing=43570][/thing], so it hasn&#039;t necessarily cost me that much.   That said, it has nudge me toward buying games I was on the fence about - [thing=37046][/thing], [thing=100901][/thing], and [thing=137762][/thing] come to mind - so there is that.  And it has put a lot of stuff in my wishlist that may be acquired at a later date when both space (need to move!) and finances (no overtime right now) allow.</body>

	<body>I broke out Tomb last night because I&#039;ve been considering trading it away, but thought I&#039;d give it another go.  This time I used my own solo rules.

1) Take out 20 characters and stack them (shuffled randomly).
2) Take out 4 more characters and start with 2 of them; place the other 2 back in the box.
3) Take out 2xD20s.  Set one at &quot;16&quot;, and the other will be used after each turn. 
4) Take the first 2 characters from the stack and place them in the Inn.  They are available to recruit.
5) Take your turn normally.  After your turn take 1xD20 and roll it.  If you roll under the number that was set, then the counter drops by 1 (e.g. I rolled a &quot;7&quot; and the counter is set at 16; drop the counter to 15).  If you roll it and it&#039;s over, discard the 2 visiting characters in the inn out of the game, and draw 2 new ones.

Game ends: 
1) If you run out of characters in the inn, you cannot get anymore help. If all the characters are gone, you only have 1 last turn to clear all tombs (by turn I mean that your counter is reset to 16, and when you roll over the number that is set, you lose).  If you cannot complete, you lose the game. If you clear the tomb before this happens, you win the game.

2) Alternate conditions (highest score):  same as #1 above, but each tomb card left is counted against your VPs collected (negative based on the amount left).  Score is based on the rules in the book.

I ended last night in defeat, and decided to count my VP - only had 36VP left.  I found this change to be quite interesting as I had to temper how far to go into the tomb and the time needed to get back to the inn if I needed a new character (which may or may not be there when I got back).  Definitely going to play this again!

I really enjoy this with Cryptmaster as a solo experience. Like you i have my own ruleset. I play it similar to Elder Sign where you disregard movement entirely and choose a Crypt to raid each turn. I play that you have to find 8 treasures to win before running out of characters. After clearing a Crypt you roll a dice to see if a treasure card is found. Which dice your roll (Green, Blue, or Red) is based on the size of the Crypt you cleared.

Anyway - i vote no on trading it as it will be very expensive to get if you want it back.

I also used to play this without the movement, but then it felt as if I was just drawing cards - and that I think was the reason it was up for trade.  Now that I added the movement requirement into the game it makes me think about how far to travel into the tomb and pushes me for &quot;just one more&quot; tomb to clear before heading back as I&#039;m already next to it.

Glad to see you&#039;re also having fun with the game :D

	<body>I&#039;m having a blast with this one working on a solitaire variant that is amusingly tough yet reasonably beatable and reliably consistent. I think we&#039;re close as I had a 58-52 victory over the MegaClinic today and am excited to apply some tweaks gleaned from today&#039;s test. I say &quot;we&quot; because I&#039;m collaborating with:

[username=steve carey]

As you might expect, Steve is abrasive, hard to work with, and doesn&#039;t have any good ideas, but I&#039;m allowing him on the project anyway. Ahem. Which is &quot;guy speak&quot; for Steve is the Nicest Guy Ever and certainly knows his stuff when it comes to making solitaire games. It&#039;s a pleasure and an honor to be exchanging ideas with him on this.

I haven&#039;t been doing any other solitaire gaming as a result of being consumed by this project and don&#039;t really have session reports to post, but I&#039;m having fun so I&#039;m not pushing myself. Suffice to say, the base system works pretty well and now it&#039;s a matter of making the game consistent or reasonably so. 

[b][size=18]ORIGIN STORIES (2)[/size][/b]
I have two actually. 

[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? [/b]
I wish I could recall, actually. I must&#039;ve tripped over the GL from a game subscription of mine maybe? In any case, I found the post to [b][listitem=3108017] my first item from [u]a year ago March[/u] [/listitem] [/b]when I had tried kittenhoarder&#039;s variant for [thing=83330][/thing]. That was my first origin story. 

Apparently, I wasn&#039;t ready to come into the fold at the time because I pretty much did a drive-by and [u]didn&#039;t return again until the fall[/u] when things crystallized and I decided to both [b][listitem=3583608]get into solitaire gaming more seriously[/listitem] [/b]and start [geeklist=183035][b]my own video series[/b][/geeklist] aimed specifically at solitaire games (and user-created variants in particular as they interest me). This is the origin story that&#039;s stuck.

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
I&#039;ll go with my 2nd attempt that actually stuck -- it was a user variant for [thing=131287][/thing], and I haven&#039;t played it since but definitely like the variant.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
People were really welcoming, like I&#039;d walked into some really friendly clubhouse somewhere. And creative. I was blown away at the variety of creative reports, a lot of them with photos. I knew there something here I needed to explore.

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]
I&#039;m just glad I didn&#039;t do another drive-by. 

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
The community here is extremely friendly and creative. I&#039;m inspired to play games and continue to make my reports more creative (haven&#039;t gotten there yet, but I&#039;m inspired to). 

I was also discovering a lot of new games I either hadn&#039;t considered for solo play or wasn&#039;t even aware of. I came back to the hobby and found BGG in 2008 so I already went through that &quot;new to the hobby&quot; phase but I feel like I&#039;m re-experiencing the new hobby smell to to some extent.

The only problem is...

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
... it&#039;s hard to see people having fun and think, &quot;I could have that fun too!&quot; and not run off and get stuff or otherwise plan a list of too many games to purchase/play. I posted a thread in the 1PG about sorting out my thoughts on all the games I want to acquire and all the ones I want to play. I tend to get a little paralyzed when I feel there&#039;s a huge &quot;to do&quot; list hanging over my head. Yeah, I know this is supposed to be fun, but even having a huge &quot;to have fun list&quot; can be a bit paralyzing, at least to me. 

So, I&#039;m trying to let others have their fun and enjoy the fun via their reports and not necessarily think I should try it too. [thing=150997][/thing] is a great example. I seem to be perfectly fine reading reports and enjoying the stories that are being told with no significant urge to get, glue, and glamorize the damn things. Keep holding back the darkness, y&#039;all.

[b]If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?[/b]
I was that guy but no more. :D

[u][b]Edit 1:[/b][/u] A successful couple of playtests today. I also reread Morten&#039;s great series of blogposts on solitaire &quot;automa&quot; design and think I&#039;m at the point where I need to back off and let others try lest I burn out. I&#039;m very happy with where it is.

Today I was behind but came vaulting back for a big lead. Until the last turn. That damn last turn. The MegaClinic came roaring back and ended up beating me due to final scoring. I think I could hear my jaw hit the floor. It was great as I want a challenging design.</body>

Fantastic giveaway!

Although I also like trees, my favorite vegetable is probably the carrot.
I like it raw or with a cheesy dip. I like it cooked with honey or plain.

Plus the tops make a tiny ferny forest frame when lined up on the windowsill.

Nice give away! 

I&#039;ve never really thought about which is my favorite vegetable before, you&#039;ve created quite a quandary here for me.  Now I feel like I have to choose and maybe broccoli feels a little slighted because I might prefer carrots. On the other hand I guess the vegetable I eat most is lettuce since I have salad (sometimes with other veggies) more often than other raw veggies... I love hot peppers but it would be so hard to choose just one...

I&#039;m going to go with Romaine Lettuce. :whistle:

While Chris&#039; push to make bacon a veggie sounds like the way to go, we&#039;ve really been enjoying the mini-trees as well lately.  Lightly sauteed broccoli with some zucchini and chopped shallots.  Yum.

Got to be the potato, but that&#039;s pretty much a given, after that I would say the Brussel Sprout (but not overcooked, they must be firm not soft), but Cauliflower and onions come close, and honey-roasted Parsnips.

Least favourite is Cabbage, Swede and Turnip.

It all depends, of course. If it&#039;s to flavor something while cooking, it would be garlic. if it&#039;s to eat, probably Brussel sprouts.

If you turn up your nose, try roasting Brussel sprouts in the oven with coconut oil and some salt and pepper. Just typing that made my stomach get excited.

I&#039;m amazed I&#039;m the only one to mention Cauliflower... I love it &#039;straight&#039; or as Cauliflower Cheese, cooked until the top is golden brown and the sauce is nice and thick. I hate the insipid watery versions that supermarkets sell.

Not entering the contest because I gave away RC, but I had to say I&#039;m surprised so many people love broccoli. I can&#039;t stand it. It makes me gag.

My favorite vegetable is chocolate. (it comes from a plant!)
(OK, if I have to pick a &quot;real&quot; vegetable, I would go with potatoes. Raw carrots or celery are &quot;okay&quot;. Or V8 juice.) :P

Hello!

I am also not entering the contest, but I wanted to chime in with my favourite vegetable (to stand against the green, flowery tide there :) :) :) ).

And my personal favourite are definitely onions. Closely followed by chili, garlic, soy bean sprouts, and bamboo sprouts. 

And sorry, [b]Bill Vee[/b], Daikon somehow did not leave a favourable impression with me - maybe just the wrong form, though (^_^;;

Yours,
Deathworks

P.S.: I don&#039;t consider rice a vegetable, otherwise that would have been no. 1, though.

Great giveaway - extremely generous of you, Mikolaj! 

My favourite vegetable is cabbage. Can&#039;t get enough of it, even if boiling it isn&#039;t the most odorous of experiences! Fortunately my partner is a big fan as well - this kind of thing could be a relationship breaker! ;)

WOW. I can&#039;t believe my luck! Thanks, Mikolaj! I continue to be amazed at the kindness and generosity that is shown on this list and throughout the 1-player guild. I will be sure to give these meeples a good home.

	<body>Played this yesterday.  Austrian victory, weight of numbers told in the end.
Still have yet to work out the best way to play the French, hang back and sit round waiting for the Austrians to show up or aggressive forward placement and charge with cavalry before Austrians are set?

Like this series of games, even if the map is a tad small for this one in particular.

Another chit pull game with the added twist of commands being with orders or without and needing roll under their commanders initiative to activate if they have no orders.  Another layer of chaos to upset the well laid plans of mice and men.

On another note after reading the excellent review by 
[user=kittenhoarder][/user]
I bought a copy of [thing=138431][/thing] of eBay for a ridiculous low price.
Also bought a copy of this rare solo game [thing=127322][/thing]

I may be the only other person on this list that owns Salamaua &#039;42!  I&#039;ll be interested to hear your views on it.  The designer has another one called [thing=87746][/thing], but it is not solo.  Yes, I own it.  :whistle:

On the topic of rare games with Aussies, do you have a copy of [thing=8245][/thing]?  Took me several years to finally track one down.

	<body>So this actually happened last night, but since it was such a good bedtime story I told myself, I promptly fell asleep on the floor after finishing.

I ambled down to the edge of the Shire to seek some adventure, bold Took that I am, and came upon a [b]stony ford[/b]. I managed to get across without getting too wet, when I came upon a [b]traveling dwarf[/b]. I asked him what his name was and he replied, &quot;there are those who call me Tim.&quot; 

So Tim and I set out over the edge of the Shire to see what we could see. There was a dark wood up ahead of us that was very cob-webby and we thought there might be a [b]spider colony[/b] there, so we avoided it. We found some [b]forgotten path[/b] and trudged along that for many miles. 

We must have been getting into some of the old Numenorean realms since we began to see [b]old castles[/b] on distant hilltops. As we rounded a bend we saw some ruins right ahead of us and wondered what could be in there. We didn&#039;t have to wait long to find out because a band of [b]highway robbers[/b] came out from behind some rocks and assailed us! They must have robbed us and taken us to be prisoner in the old castle because we woke up in what seemed like a [b]tomb[/b]. 

Tim and I were just starting to prepare our escape plan when out of the center sarcophagus a [b]foul thing[/b] emerged. It reeked of death and horror. We seemed to be blinded by a darkness that flowed from it. We reeled and stumbled backwards trying to get away from this new terror.

The darkness was suddenly shattered by daylight as the [b]brigands[/b], returning to their lair, opened an outer door. With a shriek the thing leapt on them. Seizing this opportunity, Tim and I ran for it.  

I was very grateful to have Tim at this moment though I didn&#039;t realize it at the time. Keeping his dwarven head and sense he managed to snatch back the [b]dwarven gold[/b] that had been stolen from him by the robbers. This proved to be a very smart move on Tim&#039;s part. 

As we wandered in this wild land we came upon no civilized folk. All that live out there are [b]wild folk[/b]. But even wild folk appreciate gold, and so we were able to &quot;convince&quot; them to lead us back to more civilized places. As we came near the Shire again we noticed a [b]dark cave[/b] under an old weathered hill that seemed to look pretty [listitem=3667730]familiar[/listitem], though I couldn&#039;t quite place it. 

Since we hadn&#039;t yet had our fill of adventure, we ventured in. I don&#039;t think I would have done it if I hadn&#039;t had a dwarf at my side. We hobbits are good underground, but not dwarf-good. We had made some torches, and thankfully they lasted, but we wound our way under the Shire until we came up in the cellar of the Green Dragon here! :tankard:

	<body>Arrived today. First play only, so no idea of a winning strategy yet. Good fun though and am looking forward to more plays at the weekend.

:thumbsup: Good quality board and most of the components are very nice
:thumbsup: Clear rules, only needed to consult BGG once
:thumbsup: Quick to get going, quick to play and I wanted to play again immediately
:thumbsdown: But it&#039;s now 2am with work tomorrow, so I&#039;d better stop
:thumbsdown: Cards aren&#039;t great quality, but in FFG sleeves are fine

Edit: played a game with each of the characters to see how they worked and lost all of them. Now I know what I&#039;m doing and which characters are best - next 2 games I won. </body>

Im interested in your last comment - about now you know what your doing, the next 2 games you won... was there much effort into that? or once the strategy is cracked its an easy win ?

Not easy - as certain cards, bad dice rolls and large slave markets can scupper plans.
 
My recent wins were close and I felt that they were helped by a bit of luck.

I think now I have developed my strategy so that I have a chance of winning, at least with the conductor, but it still depends on dice rolls and card draws.  

Getting off to a quick start seems essential, both freeing up space in the plantations and gaining money on every turn. I try to get to more advanced eras as soon as possible and use the sea lane quite a bit too.  

I don&#039;t feel the game is solved, partly due to the random elements, and also as I have still to attempt a win using the difficult level or with a wider range of characters.

	<body>I finally, finally, finally got Cuba Libre to the table today. 

First of all, I would like to give a huge thank you to my very generous 

[user=secret soloist][/user]
who gave me this game last year. 

I&#039;m truly embarrassed that it took me so long to play it. 

I only had time to play through the tutorial, but that&#039;s okay. I really love playing through GMT&#039;s tutorials. It&#039;s a great way to learn the game and it&#039;s a lot of fun to see a handful of turns play out. It&#039;s also really nice to spend a few hours just soaking everything in. 

My plan is to play a couple games playing all four sides before I try playing solo against the AI.  I think it will give me a better handle on the game. 

I&#039;m curious to hear how other people have played this. Do you play all four sides and just see what happens? Or do you pick one side that you would like to win, play the other factions as best as you can, and then hope your faction is victorious?

I&#039;m curious because I haven&#039;t quite got the hang of playing multiple sides just yet. 

[b]Edit - 2/11/15[/b]

I played my first full game today, playing all four sides. It went really well. I did spend a lot of time with the rules, but that was mostly because I wanted to understand the operations rather than needing to look up a bunch of rules. 

This game is great! It&#039;s really exciting to see how the different factions move their way around the country trying to control and influence everything. 

[center][ImageID=2411618medium][/center]

Here is the board at game&#039;s end. The Directorio won during the second propaganda round. They took Havana City which propelled them to victory. The 6 population points make Havana a huge deal in the game. The other three factions really messed up by letting the DR have it.

The Syndicate had 9 open casinos but couldn&#039;t scrape together the resources to win. The Government was looking really well after the first Propaganda Round but dug themselves into a deep hole by buying so many civic actions. Oops, live and learn. 26July never could get off the ground, but I think it was a slow build. However, the DR&#039;s domination of Havana stopped any chances 26July might have had. 

I know that understanding of Cuba Libre will get better with time, but I found it really difficult to look at the long game. Long-term strategy was hard to grasp so I played the game rather tactically. I also wonder how much of that was because I was trying to hold onto to four separate strategies at once. I&#039;m going to play again, but this time, I think I&#039;ll play against the AIs. </body>

Don&#039;t feel bad Ryan, I still haven&#039;t played one of the things I received from the Secret Soloist.

With Cuba Libre, I tried to play with the AIs from the get go.  It was hard and confusing trying to figure out what the AI was doing.  It didn&#039;t make sense.  I think the way to go at first is just play all the sides and get a feel for how each one works.  I found that the game was so much fun, I didn&#039;t really care who one or lost.  I just enjoyed watching the story unfold.  I haven&#039;t had the same experience with many other multiplayer games.

I still haven&#039;t played [b]two[/b] of four games my soloist got me. And the exchange was my idea! Don&#039;t feel bad. Gaming is a hobby, not a job.

They will be there when I&#039;m ready to play them. [thing=127518][/thing] and [thing=31759][/thing] are each monsters in their own right and require more time and mental capacity than I have currently. I&#039;m just glad I got the meaty [thing=102435][/thing] learned and played last year!

When you&#039;re playing all four sides, you need to keep so much info in your head at once, it&#039;s tough to plan ahead really that far.

Against other players, on the other hand, it&#039;s not hard at all.  And you easily start planning feints and strategies that will be subtly changed based on what other people are doing.

CL is a good one too, because it tends to play the shortest, so it shouldn&#039;t take months for us to finish a game.  :)  We can do a short scenario.  If anyone else wants to play that&#039;s great!  If not, I&#039;d be OK running 2 factions, with the faction with the lowest victory margin being my final score (so even if one ended the game in auto &quot;victory&quot;, and my other faction was last, I&#039;d still come in &quot;last&quot;).

I&#039;m thinking we need another list of &quot;solo players who play multiplayer on Vassal&quot; or somesuch.

I&#039;d love to play some of my games through Vassal, but don&#039;t really want to shout into the void and end up playing with grognards who rage quite because I mess up a move or something.  I would tend to believe people from this list would be a bit more forgiving.

I play multiplayer a lot using vassal pbem and dropbox for file exchange.

Currently playing Mage Knight and Paths of Glory, but I also play a lot of Memoir &#039;44 Overlord format, Through the Ages and various others.

Maybe post a new thread about it over in the 1 Player guild? I am sure not everybody will read about it here and the list will be found faster this way too.

I think it&#039;s a great idea and I really want to try Vassal too. I haven&#039;t played by mail so far but the PBF I am in right now is a lot of fun and cries for more. Right now I am just not sure which game to ask for. But I will post a request soon.

If you use Dropbox for file transfer, it takes out all the headache of playing my e-mail.

Just sent an email (or PBF thread) update to people to let them know its their turn.

I used to do that but it&#039;s much easier using dropbox. Your turn file is automatically saved to the same folder that you loaded a turn from and your opponent immediately has access to it. No messing about with email attachments.

This is what I do to.

For 2-player games I just check my dropbox folder to see if a new file has been dropped.
For multiplayer games we use a pbf thread to say who&#039;s up. I won&#039;t do multiplayer pbem without dropbox.

	<body>Made the switch from playing RftG two handed to the Robot AI (easy difficulty).

It&#039;s start world was Epsilon Eridani (#1) while mine was Damaged Alien Factory (#7).

I lost 49-58.  The Robot placed it&#039;s 12th card on the same turn we ran out of VP chips.

I got the Galactic Renaissance 6 Dev card down and had the Research Labs and Galactic Trendsetters world.

The scoring broke down as follows:

[u]VP Chits[/u]
Me: 17
Robot: 26

[u]Tableau VP&#039;s[/u]
Me: 21 + 11 (Gal Ren 6 Dev) = 32
Robot: 26 + 6 (6 dev chit) = 32

[u]Final Totals[/u]
Me: 49
Robot: 58

I really liked this.  It seemed much easier to me just to play my own hand while the Robot played its game.  It is relentless though.  It&#039;s credit and econ spiked pretty early and put me behind in the VP chit game early.

[b]EDIT 2/6[/b]
Game #2 vs AI

Me: Separatist Colony
AI: New Sparta

[u]VP Chits[/u]
Me: 8
AI: 7

[u]World VP&#039;s[/u]
Me: 19
AI: 9

[u]Dev VP&#039;s[/u]
Me: 7
AI: 10

[u]Total VP&#039;s[/u]
Me: 34, Victory!
AI: 26

[u]Final AI[/u]
Credits: 4
Econ: 2

The AI was hurt by bad draws, a couple of turns it exhausted it&#039;s draw pile.

I was able to get Space Marines and Drop Ships out pretty early and that really boosted my Military to 6 and allowed me to Settle some decent VP worlds without burning through cards.  My final three worlds settled were Rebel Colony(4 VP), Lost Alien Warship(3 VP) and Alien Robotic Factory(5 VP).  While the Factory was not a military world I was able to exhaust my hand in the final turn to lay it down and seal the win.

[b]EDIT 2/10[/b]
Been playing a few more games.  I have found that the Robot playing with Old Earth (world #0) is very difficult.  It gets &#039;x2&#039; as it&#039;s Robot action (after an initial &#039;$&#039; one) and it just rakes in the VP chits at a very fast rate.  I&#039;ve lost to it 35-10 and 48-16.  Can&#039;t really see a way to stay with it.  Maybe Military but you need the right cards for that to work.</body>

The robot is an elegant way to streamline solo play while keeping the game really challenging. I find it important to limit your production phases to prevent the robot from building up too much econ.

How did you end up with so many VP chits out? The game is limited to 24 in solo plus any extra earned after the last chit was claimed.

I thought about playing without the limit but I never tried it.

The last round started with 2 VP chits left (started with 24 available) and the robot with 11 cards out.  I knew this was the last round so I picked &#039;x2&#039; as one of my actions (Produce had been played the round before).

Of course the Robot rolled a &#039;*&#039; and so also got the &#039;x2&#039; bonus.  The Robot&#039;s economy was a 5 so he got 10 VP&#039;s.  By this time the Robot had already played his 12th card so the game was ending.  The rules state to break out the 10 VP chits for the final Consume round so that each side can collect all the VP&#039;s they are due.  I believe I also got 10 VP&#039;s in that final &#039;x2&#039; action.

Yeah, the Robot&#039;s econ grew way to quickly for me to keep up.  If only the Robot wouldn&#039;t roll &#039;*&#039; when I selected Produce (seemed like that always happened).

:arrowN::arrowN::arrowN:
Sound advice. In the games I have played I have also found that avoiding produce and consume actions is a key to success. Military strategy seems to work well against the AI 1)if you get the cards to pull it off 2)the AI&#039;s start world isn&#039;t New Sparta.

I greatly cut back on selecting Consume/Produce actions in this game and was able to win.

I&#039;ve noticed that the 12 card tableau limit means that you need to picky in what you set down.  Just because you can play a Dev or a World doesn&#039;t mean you should.  Early in the game you will need to place some lower value cards to get your economy going but after that you need to be picky about what you lay down so that you aren&#039;t stuck with a tableau filled with low density VP cards.

	<body>What a pain!  I barely saw any casual customers in the first few rounds and the first regular customer didn&#039;t show up until about the 4th round.  I wasn&#039;t making much money and ended up needing to loans early on.  I at least had a lot of fields.  Final score was 16.6

	<body>Hi everyone! It has been MONTHS since I&#039;ve posted to SGOYT.  I honestly don&#039;t have much of an excuse other than &quot;life happens&quot;.. haha... one day I felt like I was starting to get really involved with this community and the next thing I know its been months since I&#039;ve posted on BGG.

Anyway, got my copy of Tiny Epic Defenders in the mail today and decided to check it out before going to bed. This is a great little game!  Definitely seems like its going to be a good short solo game for nights like this one where I want to play a quick game before bed and don&#039;t have the energy for anything with more complicated setup and game length.  I played it on easy difficulty with only one dire enemy and lost!  I thought for sure I had it totally beat too up until the last couple of rounds. I was doing a good job of keeping the threat levels of all the regions down but totally didn&#039;t plan well for how quickly they go up when all those enemies start getting shuffled into the turn deck.  But hey, losing on easy means I have plenty of games ahead of me to get better at it  :)

[size=18]ORIGIN STORY[/size]

So, I&#039;ve been sitting here thinking about how the heck I stumbled across SGOYT in the first place and its driving me crazy that I can&#039;t remember exactly how it happened.  My story is that around the 2nd half of 2013 I started really getting back into board games. I was a huge gamer when I was younger (mostly RPGs back then) but just drifted away from regular gaming after college.  Now I&#039;ve got kids and as they started getting older and I was looking for fun stuff to do with them I started checking out board games again.  Next thing I know I had bought several games and even backed a few on Kickstarter (now up to over 50 KS projects and over 150 games in the collection total).

At some point I ended up on BGG looking for rules clarifications for some game I was playing with the kids and stumbled across something having to do with solo play of a board game. I can&#039;t remember what game it was but I remember a light bulb going off in my head (more like fireworks in hindsight) when I realized &quot;woah, it never even occurred to me to play board games solo&quot;.  I played the occasional video game but just never occurred to me to play solo board games.

By early 2014 I had found SGOYT and made my first posts.  I&#039;ve never been one to participate much in online communities so those of you that are regulars may not even remember me as I drifted away again in mid to late 2014 but am hoping to get back involved again this year as I&#039;m really hoping to get more games to the table.

Ok enough rambling for now...  hopefully I&#039;ll be posting more plays this month.</body>

I wish my copy would turn up. It shipped a week ago so hopefully not too long now.

	<body>So I downloaded this and two other solo RPG&#039;s over the weekend. Mostly paragraph driven dice rollers.  Less role-play and more roll-play adventures. 

Played this one three times, and it doesn&#039;t really get better the more you play.  A fun one-shot for four dollars... </body>

	<body>[b]Feb 5[/b] 

Played three straight games of Viticulture with Mommas &amp; Papas, Properties, and of course Automa. 

Automa is tough, but mostly I was my own worst enemy, losing twice due to my usual downfall in games, pursuing too many strategies because they all sound cool. Trying to overachieve in games tends not to work out if it&#039;s the type of overachievement that loses focus early game. 

I tried to get the cottage strategy working (draw lots of visitors in the hopes of getting bonus actions, cards, and points) without getting the cottage from my papa, which is not a strategy to pursue when time is so short. It did work for me once when I got the cottage from papa, but not so much otherwise. 

The third game succeeded because I focused my strategy at long last, and did it based on the cards from momma and the [i]small cellar[/i] from papa. This all told me: make looooots of wine tokens as soon as possible. I also concentrated on creating a couple new workers while getting vines planted early on. 

But I don&#039;t know what strategy you start off with when you get, say, the windmill as an inherited structure. Do you just trade it for money so you can get a trellis and irrigation early on? 

Can you win games without investing in the large cellar? 

You definitely need irrigation or the trellis or, preferably, both. But I might try a new strategy (depending on what I draw)... 

Properties was interesting, but I seem unable to use it properly. I probably need to be more aggressive about it. The game I won I didn&#039;t sell any properties at all because I simply didn&#039;t have time and Automa kept blocking the sell grapes space when I had better uses for my grande worker. 

Next on the docket is... Patronage. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll try to win every game in order to advance to the next, if only because I won&#039;t have enough time to do so before the review next week (which will require the script to finish at latest on Tuesday, and filming to finish at latest on Wednesday). 

Meanwhile I finished the first cut of the script for the Core Worlds tutorial, which I&#039;ve broken up into three videos (basic concepts, for people who&#039;ve never played Core Worlds; the base game with SoloPlay rules; and the addition of Galactic Orders). 

Busy, busy, busy. The week after will be more relaxed. 

[b]Feb 6 - Properties and Patronage[/b] 

Adding the Patronage expansion made it easier to beat Automa, what with 3 points granted by filling a wine order of a 5 wine and an extra 2 points for accomplishing the activated Patronage card&#039;s goal by end game (in this case, 6+ structures). I scored 24 points. I was more aggressive with agriculture, since I got the Windmill from my papa. I did sell a property in order to pay for some structures, so I finally used that expansion correctly. 

Advanced Visitors is the next expansion to add to the mix, and I&#039;m excited to have visitors that are useful at multiple points in the game, rather than just one. Thank goodness! I&#039;m going to use the Advanced Variant and remove some of the original visitors. Poor original visitors.

[b]Feb 6 - Advanced Visitors[/b]

I removed the original visitors that had no advanced version, and thus had mostly advanced visitors throughout the game. Wow, they made a difference. Now there&#039;s even more paths to explore, not all of them victorious. 

I made 19 points. It would have been 21 if only I had not miscalculated in mid-game. I could have had a blushing wine for my Patronage to pay off, but noooo. 

I&#039;m tempted to try again with another bonus token. But the first Tier 2 expansion, which is basically more visitors, sounds intriguing and not too difficult. After that it&#039;s the expanded board, which looks like it&#039;ll make games last longer, which I&#039;m not sure I will like... one of the things I love about Viticulture is that it&#039;s a good weight of Euro in a short amount of time. 

[b]Feb 6 - New Visitors[/b] 

Added in the new visitors except for the Swindler, and removed the Queen from the winter visitor deck as well, since they are both purely interactive cards and carry zero solo benefit. 

I won again at 24 points. 

Now... onto the expanded board, side 1. I&#039;m curious to see what that does to the game. 

And then tomorrow it&#039;s mostly filming and then spending Sunday editing.

[b]Feb 6 - Extended Board[/b] 

Wow. This board adds so much. Now I can get bonuses on some of the spaces without paying bonus tokensâunless Automa gets there first, of course. 

Also, ow. I ended up 14 points behind Automa, at 21 points. Not shabby on the normal board, but pretty bad on this new one. Of course, it didn&#039;t help that papa left me quite a bit of money but only a yoke. I&#039;m not sure what strategy you can frame around the yoke. 

I could have turned in the yoke for 1 lira, but given that I had to spend at least one extra action on a structure, it didn&#039;t seem the best possibility in the world. 

I was often behind the eight ball, and it was worse since I didn&#039;t create more than one extra worker. There are so many spaces and four seasons to spread workers around. o_o Plus there&#039;s now an area control element on a map.

I&#039;m definitely going to throw in one more play before moving onto the structures expansion. 

One thing I dislike about the expansion is that it walks further and further away from the theme in some areas.

[b]Feb 7 - Still Extended Board[/b] 

I would like to make an announcement. 

I have scored 43 points against the &quot;easy&quot; Automa (which scored 31 points). 

I am flabbergasted at myself. I didn&#039;t know I had the winemaking spirit in me. I was aggressive with the area control game, or influence, especially since placing in an area yields rewards as well. I also kept making workers whenever possible until I had the full six, which gave me sooo many possibilities. I&#039;d say you pretty much can&#039;t win the game unless you do that... just as you can&#039;t win the game without 

1. Trellis
2. Irrigation
3. Small cellar
4. Large cellar

I made a bunch of sparkling wine (well, two) and sold them off for four VP each. I saved my grand worker to either create new workers or to fill wine orders. I used all my bonus tokens to either place extra stars or to get +1 VP on the fill orders, plus once the one time I was allowed to trade twice and pay 6 coins (5 from my residuals from the previous year) to get two more victory points. 

Plus I made the most of all my visitors, including trading two away for more wine order cards. 

I&#039;m not sure I really had a strategy apart from &quot;make wine, lots of wine, lots and lots and lots of wine.&quot; Such a strategy demands early planting so that wine tokens can be made. Blushes were easier than whites or reds because I often combined red and white grapes on single fields. 

I also had harmonious numbers on my fields (2 red, 3 white, 3 red, 3+1=4 white) and was harvesting grapes and making wine like gangbusters.

It helped that the AI did not press me as hard on the final two years in fall and winter. 

Then I hit the Patronage tipping point, delivering a 5 wine to activate it. I already had 5 vine cards planted to also satisfy its condition, netting a total of 5 VP alone. 

I hit hard as possible and basically brought my weak El Grande game to the influence map. 

Oh, what fun I had. What fun. I&#039;m prepared to move to Special Workers, after which follows Structures. Thence to Aboriculture (apples and tomatoes!) and Formaggio (cheese! but cheese can apparently go rotten. Somehow). 

Hopefully I&#039;ll have everything wrapped up in time for a Wednesday filming of the Viticulture/Tuscany review, else I&#039;ll have to delay it until Friday or Saturday. 

Today I spent most of my time filming the basic concepts tutorial and the base game tutorial for Core Worlds SoloPlay. 

[b]Feb 9 - Special Workers[/b] 

So February 8th was spent finishing filming, then editing video, and then finally posting [thread=1317145][/thread]. There&#039;s still some work left over (the audio-only release) but for now I am gaming. Today I also ran some errands. 

And today I also played more Viticulture! This time adding on the Tier 2 expansion &quot;Special Workers&quot;. The two workers for the game paired together really well: the Messenger, who travels into the future to reserve a spot; and the Traveler, who travels into the past to take a spot regardless of the action spaces available by player count. So the Traveler can, if I&#039;m reading this properly, take an otherwise unassailable 3-player space. 

With all this time traveling power at hand, I still was pressed very hard to beat Automa. Even though I managed to do so by 4 points (scoring 33 points), I had to make over 10 points in the final round of the game. In the influence game I decided to just block the AI from scoring majorities as much as possible. 

It says something about Automa that even with time travel I couldn&#039;t relax my game at all. Usually I look like I&#039;m losing horribly until round 7, haha. 

Highly enjoyable. Looking forwards to Structures tomorrow. I think the review will be delayed until Saturday, because Tuscany is just so freaking DEEP. 

[b]Feb 10 - Structures[/b] 

Well... I didn&#039;t build any, even though I drew a few. 

My mama left me $2 and only two cards. My papa left me a victory point that I did not take, instead taking the $3, along with $3 more. This was not an auspicious start. 

The special workers were the professor (you may retrieve a regular worker from the current season and use it again this year) and the traveler (travels back in time). I only had five workers in allâthe professor, the traveler, two regular workers, and the grande worker. 

If I hadn&#039;t been distracted by needing to build structures that weren&#039;t inherited from my papa, I probably would have built one of the new structures. Although I had to discard more cards that were purely opponent-based. 

I won by 1 point, 31 to 30. It was an incredibly close game and had I miscalculated by actually building one of the new structures, I would have lost by at least four points. 

Hm. 

Tomorrow I get to juggle all this plus making tomato sauce and olive oil in the Aboriculture expansion. Maybe I can build useful structures then. 

Such a lot to explore. 

[b]Feb 11 - Still Structures[/b] 

I could have won it, if the wine order draws hadn&#039;t been so bad, and if the AI hadn&#039;t taken the &quot;sell one wine token&quot; spot AND the &quot;harvest one field&quot; spots. Ah well. Lost 26 to 31. 

I did build the Label Factory, which is why I didn&#039;t lose as badly as I could have. I should have chosen to go there first instead of to the normal wine fill spot because you get 2VP every time you set foot there. Also I wish I&#039;d taken the time to make another worker, but I didn&#039;t, thus missing out on the Mafioso. 

Hrm hrm hrm hrm. Also I didn&#039;t perform as well with my beginning VPs as I could have. The &quot;normal&quot; Automa would have crushed me in year 3 or even earlier. 

Time to break out Aboriculture I guess, even though I&#039;m quite sure I&#039;ll lose. 

[b]Feb 11 - Aboriculture![/b] 

Lost by 4 points! 27 to 31. I got distracted by all the aboriculture (tree-growing) and keeping morale up because by gods I got crushed under the heel when I was working often enough to not want to do the same to little wooden meeples. It doesn&#039;t make sense, I know, but right now the idea of working people to unhappiness, depression, illness, or suicide is touchy to me, even when it&#039;s about hypothetical people. 

Anyways, so I really tried to get apple trees. Apples never give you victory points except indirectly by being one of the gifts you can give to your workers at the end of the year to boost morale. Also, apples have this advantage over tomatoes and olives in that they go directly from harvest to the warehouse, whereas you need to spend extra turns and workers turning tomatoes into sauce and olives into olive oil. Sure, they&#039;re worth points, but meanwhile your workers are unhappy. 

I was happy with two apple trees, but really, it would have been better to just make a gazillion wine tokens and have one apple tree. You could then 

1. Spend one year discarding wine tokens and one apple to boost up to the &quot;+1 vp&quot; morale bar. 
2. Next year, when your morale goes down one bar for using the grande worker, increase morale again to the &quot;+1 vp&quot; bar by discarding a single apple token. 
3. Keep earning VPs for making workers happy. 

This strategy requires an early vine and wine boost, which I didn&#039;t get because my papa left me a tasting table. It was difficult to make use of, but did net 3 VPs which I guess is something. 

As for structures, I built the dock (residual income: 1 wine card) but there was so much going on! I definitely did not do my patronage card, which would have won me the game. 

Lessons learned, I suppose. Thinking about trying this expansion again (this is everything from tiers 1 and 2 plus Aboriculture). 

[b]Feb 11 - Aboriculture Again![/b] 

This time I beat up easy Automa, 37 to 31. I didn&#039;t bother with morale, which makes me sad, but as I didn&#039;t get an apple tree (but tomato and then olive trees) I knew that the destined strategy was wine, wine, wine. 

I made use of every part of the expansions involved: 

- Mamas &amp; Papas for set up
- Property, sold the $5 property
- Patronage, made the patronage though not the secret goal
- Advanced visitors, played
- New visitors, played
- Extended board, de facto
- Structures, built the label factory and veranda (reinforcing the wine wine wine strategy)
- Special workers, used both (the Traveler and the Farmer, the time traveler and the bonus taker, respectively)
- Aboriculture, cultivating tomato and olive trees, then using refined olive oil to boost wine orders
- Automa, of course

I tended to not use my bonus tokens as a result of having the Farmer, allowing me to use them to create more scoring opportunities. 

I worry a bit that it&#039;s not skill but luck that&#039;s letting me beat the easy Automa.... or maybe just a combo of both. 

[b]Feb 12 - Formaggio![/b] 

Ha ha, I stumbled around trying to figure out how best to use cheese, which mixed up my wine wine wine strategy. I managed to make 27 points versus Automa&#039;s 32, which isn&#039;t too shabby (is it?) when you don&#039;t know what to do with a main strategy vein in the new game world. 

I&#039;m thinking that cheese allows you to make points faster, if you can get your wine game going sooner, which doesn&#039;t always work that well with other opponents who block you. I never used the Politico, I think I could have used some bonus spaces repeated. And I constantly felt one worker short, which made sense with the extra actions needed for milking the cows and creating cheese. 

I tried desperately to draw visitors. It didn&#039;t help that papa left me just a yoke, and I gave up on it and decided to just take the $2. I feel like the odds were just against me this game, but I also feel that if I had a better grasp of cheese it wouldn&#039;t have made a difference. 

Which is sometimes both the best and the worst feeling a game with any player count can give you, but I think it&#039;s especially poignant in solo games. 

Automa is excellent from start to finish, and believe it or not, I [b]still[/b] have depths to plumb. 

I&#039;m wondering if I should do an enormous playthrough of everything (I like Aboriculture the best thus far, although I feel that I could grow to like Formaggio just as much, though I feel it&#039;s the most advanced of the expansions). 

Viticulture is great. Viticulture with Tuscany is exquisite. </body>

Glad to hear this one is holding up. It&#039;s not necessarily high on my list for solo play as I bought primarily for game nights, but I do want to try it out and see what Morten came up with, especially after reading all his excellent blogposts on the subject.

It sounds like you are having a real fun time with Viticulture/Tuscany. I&#039;ve yet to &#039;uncork&#039; anything but the Mamas and Papas, and I want to pursue the suggested Automa Campaign. Lots of gaming left in this!

It&#039;s definitely holding up! And with three levels of the AI, even if you get better you can always get beaten down. :D

[q=&quot;Dave in Ledbury&quot;]It sounds like you are having a real fun time with Viticulture/Tuscany. I&#039;ve yet to &#039;uncork&#039; anything but the Mamas and Papas, and I want to pursue the suggested Automa Campaign. Lots of gaming left in this!
I&#039;m looking forward to your video - don&#039;t rush it if you&#039;re having fun! :D[/q]

Definitely pursue the suggested campaign. It&#039;s lots of fun and it doesn&#039;t dump the entire world over your head! There&#039;s quite a lot to explore in Tuscany.

	<body>Played my second game last night using two characters(the Assassin and Barbarian) against the Ancient One.
I actually I did ok for a while, but once two of the outer regions fell, it was game over.
This game is one tough mother..but I love it. It&#039;s funny- wife will ask me if I won when she sees me playing a game, and I say &quot;no&quot; and when she sounds disappointed, I remind her(and myself) that I had fun anyways!</body>

This game is definitely tough but I&#039;m also loving it.  I&#039;ve played twice, once with 2 characters and just finished another game now with 3 characters.  I lost both times but I&#039;m having a blast.

So I backed Tiny Epic Galaxies and they wrote that you can add Tiny Epic Defenders (and TEK) in as an add-on afterwards for $27

I don&#039;t own TED -- is it good for solo and occasional people play? Obviously Ian and Brad think so.

It is good for solo play, it&#039;s quick, and there are enough hero/villains that you can get a good amount of play out of it.
I too backed Galaxies once they reached the strech goal of adding solo play

	<body>[size=24]:star::star::star: PROMO CARD GIVEAWAY :star::star::star:[/size]

I was going to do another challenge this month but I&#039;ve decided to do this instead as I want to make the challenge something good and don&#039;t have the time to do it justice at the moment.  Hopefully, this will be fun too.

I have 5 promo cards for this game.

[imageid=2405146]

Can you guess all 5? If you do, you can have all 5.

The full list of promos (only 10) can be found here: http://www.dungeoncrawler.com/ecg/promos_2010.html
[b]
Rules and other stuff:[/b]

1 entry per person.

Please own the game.

There are no multiples amongst the 5.

I will end this sometime in the morning (my local time) on the 13th February.

If you guess all 5 correctly you will win all 5.

[b]In the event of a tie, here is a tie-break question (the nearest answer will win the cards): on what date did I attend my first live football (soccer for those who like to use a made up word) match? (I was born in the mid 70&#039;s if that is any help.)[/b]  Please put your tie breaker answer in with your guesses.

If no one guesses all 5 then the nearest guess will win 1 promo of their choice from those they guessed correctly. Again, the tie breaker will decide if there is a tie.

If no one wins all 5, the remaining 4 will roll over to next month when I will do a challenge or another giveaway.
[b]
Entrants:[/b]

Wayne LaBanca
shacky22
often
Mikolajl
Raygun1966

[b]Edit: I have changed the rules slightly. If no one guesses all 5 then the winner will get one promo of their choice from those they guessed correctly rather than a random card.[/b]

[imageid=2414143]

And the winner is...... Mikolajl.

3 out of 5. You were also closest on the tie breaker too (27 Oct 1984, Spurs v Stoke). Not that you needed it.

I will be in touch. Congratulations. </body>

As I forgot to take a picture of the fronts of all 5 and I don&#039;t have them with me at work I will extend the entry deadline until this evening so I can do a reveal and everyone can see how they did.

It will probably be around 6pm my time.  Sorry for the delay guys, my bad.

	<body>Still working my way through getting wins against all the [thing=137762]Dark City[/thing] villans.  Last night I played against Mr. Sinister with the Capture Baby Hope scheme.  Got my win!  Love this game, gets lots of plays both as a solo and as a multi-player.  This game has great legs and has been well worth the investment.  Starting to get an itch for buying a new expansion...just wondering whether I hold out for the next larger expansion or pull the trigger on [thing=149922]Paint the Town Red[/thing] or [thing=163106]maybe GOtG[/thing]

As a sidenote, I am probably in the minor here but I enjoy the setup/takedown aspect as it speaks to the customizable/configurable nature of the game.

	<body>I just posted my own solo variant for this game (which has 20 hours left on Kickstarter).  Plays quite nicely with the AI I&#039;ve designed; it&#039;s dumb, but doesn&#039;t hold anything back!

So, erm, yeah, I&#039;ve been playing this today, obviously. :D

[thread=1315656][/thread]

Some thoughts:
:thumbsup: A solo variant! Woohoo! I don&#039;t have to play both sides of a 2-player game now. :)
:thumbsdown: It&#039;s not that intelligent an AI.
:thumbsdown: I bet Scott Almes&#039; AI design is going to be MUCH better.</body>

Almes AI for Harbour isn&#039;t smart either, but it&#039;s still tough to beat because it gathers so many resources so quickly. 

I&#039;m happy to see this -- I&#039;m planning on building a PnP version once the &quot;enhanced&quot; PnP files come out for backers.

	<body>I decided to break this one out of the dust for the challenge. Since it&#039;s been awhile, I need to reacquaint myself. Had the place to myself this morning (afternoon will be hectic) so I treated myself to a session of this as a reward for surviving this week. In the morning, I tend to feel most optimistic and have the most energy so it&#039;s a great time to do it (it&#039;s also a great time to tend to my responsibilities, but priorities amirite).

Well, it&#039;s definitely been awhile. I ended up with a Fab-o score of, dum da da dum(!), 14. Wait, it gets better! I had two loans(!) so 12. This was my first game where I bought the improved shed to hold 4 veggies.

I realize now that one thing I was doing was trying to sell and not plant. This meant I had to keep buying. Despite my best efforts, I had to recompensate many angry customers repeatedly. 

I really enjoyed this session because I saw where I could improve, that&#039;s always time well spent. One thing I&#039;ll point out that&#039;s obvious to many of us, When it&#039;s clear you&#039;re going to lose (and lose badly), instead of wrapping up the game then and there it is sometimes worth it to keep going because you will see the end result of your planning and possibly learn something. The early game chaos will feel that much less chaotic next time. 

Have it setup already for another go around when I get some time to do so.

I don&#039;t want to give any negatives because of my mood recently so I&#039;ll just give one positive

:thumbsup: It&#039;s great to play a game that plays in less than an hour but you actually build an engine and feel a real evolution and progression. I love building engines (the gifts that keep on giving!) and Uwe&#039;s magic is certainly present here.

If anyone is wondering, despite the planting being similar to how it is done in Agricola, the main economic decisions here of spending money to make more money (as opposed to what most euros call &quot;economic&quot;) really make this game feel different to the rest of his games. The market is static but you&#039;re constantly struggling to increase your income and that, to me, is much more satisfying than trying to attain VPs. Although there are VPs in this game, they are ONLY earned by spending money so your focus is just on making money. The game is very mathy in that sense and it&#039;s awesome!</body>

	<body>Just got this one on the table last night to take it for a test drive.  It&#039;s (self-admittedly) not a simulation but an abstracted look at the challenges and strategies related to the war for American independence.

The player is the British (which includes Regulars, Loyalist, Hessian, Indian, and naval units), while the system takes care of the American rebels (which includes Continentals, Committees of Security, smugglers/privateers, and French allies).  Militia is handled abstractly on a battle-by-battle basis, which is one of the cooler tidbits in this rather unique system.

At first blush the map was a negative, but there is a clever functionality to how things mesh: sea zones off of regions (dubbed &quot;states&quot; in-game), four sections (dubbed &quot;counties&quot; in-game) per state, each with a terrain designation, which in turn meshes with unit ratings.

My first few turns have been dramatic swings of momentum.  My British Regulars (dubbed &quot;Lobsters&quot; in-game, and how can you not like that?!?) annihilated a sizable American presence in New England, only to have the tables turned due to a major American campaign shortly thereafter which almost swept the board clean of my red crustaceans.  THAT, in turn, was followed by a decimating dose of smallpox and enlistments running out (take that one-two punch, you rascally colonists!).  When I left the board last night, units were few and far between, and the Americans were peacefully drinking Sam Adams while I pondered a career in IPA shipping.  

:shake:

More to follow...</body>

	<body>Wow - it&#039;s been ages since I played a game of TM.  I decided to play a 2-handed session last night to get back into the game.  I randomly drew the Mermaids vs. Cultists.   Early on Mermaids were expanding like crazy across the board, but didn&#039;t focus on upgrading right away to build a stack of workers.  Cultists were more focused on developing and ran short on workers early on, but were loaded with money.  In the end though, cultists were able to work up the cult tracks ahead of the mermaids, and won a solid victory 114 to 98.

Now that I&#039;ve gotten this back to the table, I need to try the solo variant on BGG :)

That was probably it. I remember that box on Amazon going for something like $80 and I was like &quot;nah, not hot enough...&quot;.

	<body>My wife was on a business trip all this week, so I was left to my own devices after the kids went to sleep. Solitaire games ahoy!

I picked this one up last weekend after watching Das Boot for the first time, and have played a couple games. My first playthrough, with Kommandant Fredirich Keller, was mediocre: he survived the war, and ended up with 170,000 tons of ships sunk, but I played it entirely too safe. That total took 17 patrols, and there were numerous opportunities missed because I wasn&#039;t aggressive enough.

My current playthrough is shaping up to be much more exciting. I sank a capital ship on my second patrol, and I&#039;m getting smarter at picking out targets.</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve been working on a variant of this, a version based on the worlds of Patrick Rothfuss&#039; Kingkiller Chronicles, called Tales of the Four Corners. The hard thing about adapting a game like this is that you&#039;d typically examine the game to see what to tweak and how to fit everything in, but the very last thing I want to do is look too closely through the encounter book! So, I&#039;ve been doing the next best thing, and playing solo games while choosing reactions I typically wouldn&#039;t, to see what happens. Court the beggar, taunt the djinn, drink from the black river! It&#039;s true, I am encountering things I&#039;ve never seen before, and sometimes it works out well, but in general, I&#039;ve found my first instincts are pretty sound. You don&#039;t need to eat the yellow snow to know that it probably tastes bad...</body>

Yes about the yellow snow, but if you don&#039;t do the odd things, odd things won&#039;t happen to you in this game. 

I usually set myself in a tipsy mood to play this particular game. I notice people who don&#039;t generally don&#039;t enjoy themselves for some reason or other.

From my plays using the official solitaire variant, I can&#039;t confirm that. I stick to sober mode but I do try to have a character concept and pick answers accordingly. And I do have a wonderful time with it each time.

Well it&#039;s good to know that, actually. Whenever I brought this game out the past couple years, people get so dismissive and pained at its presence, but I probably have been hanging out with the wrong crowd. I tend to be the only person who enjoys the game. 

Actually.... come to think of it, that is the other way to enjoy the game: to have a character and stick with that character. Too often people would just turn their noses up at particular choices even if it would make story sense for them to consider those choices. 

Yeah, I probably brought this game to the wrong crowds.

People that get too hung up on &quot;what&#039;s the right move here&quot; hate this game. Maybe I&#039;m too used to role playing games where you&#039;re just goofing off, but I love it.

	<body>I had a few minutes with nothing to do this afternoon so I pulled out Onirim. I really do enjoy this game. It&#039;s so quick and fun, yet I feel like I have tough decisions to make. 

I played with Book of Steps Lost and Found and I really played badly. I kept discarding cards hoping to get the colors I needed. What I should have been doing was use the discarded cards to swap for the doors I could find instead of hoping for the cards to open the doors I couldn&#039;t find. By the end, there was simply nothing left for me. I guess I&#039;ll be stuck in that labrynth for awhile. 

When I first played the game, I thought that the base game was okay, and the expansions really brought it to life. Now, I still feel that is true and I enjoy the expansions, but sometimes I just want to enjoy the elegant simplicity of the base game. 

:thumbsup: I really love this second edition. It&#039;s superbly put together and the packaging just fits the game so well. It&#039;s always a treat to open up that box. 
:thumbsdown: The cards of the second edition are such lower quality than the first edition. I&#039;m surprised by the decision by Z-Man. I can&#039;t believe they didn&#039;t keep the card quality the same. 
:thumbsdown: It makes me wish I kept the first edition so I could use those cards when I wasn&#039;t playing with the new expansion. 

On a side note: Justin, this game is awesome. It&#039;s worth the trouble you&#039;ve had with the misprinted copy. :)

	<body>I had been awhile since I last pulled this off the shelf, which is part of the reason I added it to my [geeklist=183042]10x10 challenge[/geeklist]. I decided to play the Emergence scenario again as a rules refresher. I went with Marcus and Augustus.

Even though it is just the introductory scenario, I did find myself scrambling to complete the mission. I was able to close the last emergence hole without too much worry, but the mob of Locusts that appeared afterwards presented a bit of a challenge. Augustus ended-up bleeding out after I left him open to a Boomer after a failed mortar attack. Luckily, Marcus had just enough life and luck left to finish off the last group of Locusts.

I had forgotten how much fun and tense this game can be. I&#039;m looking forward to moving on to the China Shop scenario, which I have never been able to complete.

[b]2/18 Update[/b]

This update is well over a week late as I just haven&#039;t had the time to update this thing. Anyway... I was able to take a few more cracks at the China Shop scenario and am happy to report that I finally got a victory.

The first few plays were pretty much par for the course. I would get about halfway through only to get ambushed by a gang of locusts and die. I finally decided to change my strategy up a bit. Instead of trying to defeat all the Locusts in my path, I would be more selective and make getting to cover my main priority. 

The benefits of this approach were immediately noticeable as I noticed that keeping 1 or 2 drones and/or wretches around actually reduced the amount that would spawn through the AI cards. The overall threat level became easier to manage and I was able to spend a few turns just hanging out, filling up some life and/or luring Locusts to their doom. There was still a fair amount of running and gunning, but that mostly came during the last part of the scenario.

[imageid=2419890]
[i][b]Who&#039;s the big man now?!?![/b][/i]

In the end, I was able to lure the berserker to the courtyard and defeat him with a nice Teamwork/Pummel combo. Victory!</body>

	<body>Oh man does this game know how to beat you down. I played the full Spanish scenario over two nights and how different both nights were! First night I didn&#039;t have a bad roll or cube draw even when I felt like I was pushing my luck. At one point I&#039;m sure military was +5 against enemy morale.

Tonight how my luck changed! Passage of time wiped out all but one elder - the one in the rightmost box did survive, the two in 1-2 boxes croaked it. A tribal raid hammered me followed by an enemy raid 3 wiping out two families thanks to a total family ferocity of 7 bumping it up. Fail to plan for the long term and you suffer!

I&#039;ve got a lot of time for this game, get over the steep learning curve and there&#039;s a lot to go at. The next learning curve is getting the strategy right so that you beat it!

Almost forgot. Major family defeat. :(</body>

	<body>Solo play with 1 deck (core set only - simulate to 3 exemplars of each card).
Spheres: [b]Tactics + Lore[/b] (Gloin - Dunhere - Eowyn)
Scenario: [b]Journey along the Anduin[/b]

The base of the deck is being able to use Gloin as an accelerator, sacrifice him for Brok and return it in play with Fortune or Fate card.
[b][i]Game 1[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #6 (No ally to defend against the Hill Troll)
[b][i]Game 2[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] turn #18 ; 170+46-15=201 Pts (well, this deck is quite slow. And when I was ready to fight the Hill Troll the second one turn up. And I had the Chieftan Ufthak on the last part of the scenario)
[b][i]Game 3[/i][/b] (with shadow card): [color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] turn #7 ; 60+30-4=86 Pts (I was very lucky. A treachery card without any impact on the setup and another one + a location when turning the third part of the scenario)
[b][i]Game 4[/i][/b] (with shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #6 (Very bad draw from the encounter deck with the Necromancer&#039;s Pass as setup and the second troll on turn #2)

Clearly dependant of the encounter deck right now and not good enough. I will retry it with a deck of 3*10 cards without accelerators to find out the base of a nearly optimal deck against this quest. I will try something like:
[u]Heroes:[/u] Theodred - Dunhere - Eowyn
[u]Allies:[/u] Beorn - Faramir - Silverlode Archer - Northern Tracker - Wandering Took
[u]Attachments:[/u] Unexpected Courage
[u]Events:[/u] Ever Vigilant - Sneak Attack - The Galadhrim&#039;s Greeting - A Test of Will

Cause, first I didn&#039;t remember the Beorn&#039;s trick when I build my first deck, and I think it will be awesome here. Well, this is just the Sneaked Beorn here as I think that Stand and Fight is not part of the base deck but a support card in case.</body>

[b]Character:[/b] Scholar

After reading [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/183994/item/3644248#item3644248]the session report in last month&#039;s SGoYT list[/url] by [user=repairmanjack][/user]
and doing a bit of research, I found myself intrigued and ordered a set of cards for this nifty PnP dungeon crawler.  It was a great solitaire experience; the design is clever and intuitive and plays smoothly while offering some agonizing decisions.

I drew the Scholar to start off, and proceeded to bumble my way around the dungeon.  After the first level, I had the mechanics and game flow down pretty well.  It&#039;s great how the cards drive everything and have multiple uses.  I found them very easy to use and read no matter what their purpose.

It rapidly became clear to me that it is primarily a hand-management game.  Cards in the hand represent hit points -- when you have none left, you are dead and lose the game.  Thus, having to discard a card to do almost everything in the game creates a delicious tension.  Even something as mundane as moving to another room becomes fraught as you not only choose which type of card to discard to execute the action, but also which sort of wandering monster you must potentially face.

I managed to get through the first five levels well enough, although there were some close calls in there.  At one point I got to a Mystic Portal with just a single card left in my hand -- I would not have been able to move again had the Portal not been there to let me descend and gain a fruit for resting.

I wasn&#039;t quite sure what try for in terms of character development, so I settled for collecting cash and upping my basic stats as often as I could.  I hit the Peculiar Store on the first three levels, and kept thinking it would turn up in the future, but I never saw it again.  While I picked up (and used) several mundane items and potions, I got nothing I would consider terribly powerful.

But I made it to level 8 and had about as good a setup as possible.  I had all three abilities maxed out, but I descended from level 6-7 with only one card left.  The first room was the Hidden Door with 0 danger but ((A)) check1 for a monster to fight, with a 2-5 chance at getting a monster.  A monster would have killed me, but I drew a 1 to get an item!  It was just a rope, but I was relieved simply to survive.  Then, since it was danger 0 and I had the fruit from descending, I immediately rested to get back up to 9 cards.  Then I used a move card to move (keeping hand size at 9) and found the Mystic Portal!  I decided it would be best to hit level 8 with 9 cards and a fruit, so I descended then and there without exploring level 7 further.  The first card of level 8 was the Mystic Portal.  I used a move card to start exploring and found the Pit of Darkness; this meant I was hitting the final tests/combat with a full hand of 9 cards.

And not just any 9 cards: I had two 5-INT, two 5-AGL and two 5-STR.  With my abilities upgraded to the maximum +4 each, this was about as good as it was going to get.  I easily passed the first two tests to enter the treasure pit for the combat with the Ice Dragon.  I had two 5-STR cards and a +4 STR score.  I did not have any arrows or strength items, however, so I would need to draw a 4 or a 5 power for the second effort in order to beat the dragon&#039;s 13 STR.  I drew a 3 the first time, falling one short.  Then the second time a drew a 3.  I then threw down a 5 move card I had drawn, but drew a 2 for second effort.  At this point, I chose to run away, which I managed to do by discarding all but one card.  Then I used my one fruit to rest at the top of the pit and fill up to 9 cards for another try.

Alas, I drew nothing higher than a 4, and then only two of these. Reentering the Pit, I failed the first two INT tests to open the door, but got it open finally.  I then managed to pass the AGL test to get into the treasure pit, but I was left with a hand of nothing higher than 3&#039;s -- insufficient to beat the Ice Dragon since his STR is 13.  Death ensued when I couldn&#039;t muster enough to run away.  Not that running would have made a difference: I was out of fruit, so would have been limited to teleporting out of the dungeon and merely surviving.

In hindsight, I should have moved to the portal after my first attempt on the pit failed and simply left the dungeon, at least gaining a Survival result; however ignominious that might be, it would have at least gotten me a small positive score.  I can see how holding onto some items/potions which increase combat strength is beneficial for this final battle.  In future sessions, I will be much more chary of using such things without dire need.

I am highly impressed with this design.  It packs a deep, immersive and tense experience into a small package with the ingeniously implemented multiple use cards.  It will be hitting my table again soon.</body>

	<body>Getting back to my [geeklist=183197]2015 Challenge[/geeklist] focused on bicycle racing games with this one. 

1. [2/6] This was my first play of this game, and, as usual, I missed a critical rule until about halfway through. It didn&#039;t necessarily affect the outcome of the race, but does make a big difference in terms the overall feel of the game. Nonetheless, I&#039;m looking forward to another couple of plays to get a better grasp of where it falls on my list of cycling games. I may also have to take a shot at one of the other language versions of the rules to make sure the English one is correct, or that I&#039;m interpreting it correctly.

2. [2/7] This is a quick playing game, even when playing all 12 riders solo. I was more confident about the rules this second time through and appreciated the flow of the riders, which seems to reflect what one would expect on the road given the course I chose and the energy I used for each rider. Next time out, I&#039;ll make a longer course since that should complicate the decisions on energy use through the race. These first two plays have demonstrated some of the tactical nuances of the system, now I have to see if I can implement them more effectively.

3. [2/7] With a longer course this time out, the elegance of the game mechanics became more apparent. Proper use of energy, both stretching it out over a whole race and choosing the moment to exert the crucial effort, are critical factors here. Some of the tactical subtleties are also revealing themselves.  

The game designers suggest expanding the rules to include specialist riders and other factors. With an excellent base to work with, I think this game is an excellent candidate for development that way. It&#039;s also one of my favorite things to do with these games...:whistle:

It&#039;s been very interesting to see how the different games try to accomplish their goal of providing the flavor of a bicycle race on a cardboard map. This whole process is also demonstrating to me the value of a 10 x 10 type of challenge. Perhaps next year I&#039;ll delve deeper into the games I find most interesting. My fear is that I&#039;ll end up with 20 games that need more investigation, and there&#039;s no way I can get in that many in one year. :(</body>

	<body>[2/1] I hadn&#039;t played this for a couple of years and it showed! :blush: My local volunteer firefighters will be very happy that I just call Bingo for them and don&#039;t get near any fires! Firefighters were knocked down continuously, most of the household died, and then the whole thing fell down, taking out the rest of the family. Quite a debacle, but it left me anxious to go back for another try. I&#039;m hoping to finally get one of the expansions on the table.

Oh, I forgot to mention, I did save the dog!:shake:</body>

	<body>I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t seen anyone post about this game on here yet. 

I wasn&#039;t a fan of Ghost Stories even though I liked the art, and so I traded that away a while ago.  The same designer put out Samurai Spirit, and I personally like the theme better as I studied martial arts for years, and am a big fan of samurai flicks.

I played my first 2 games of it tonight and each game takes about 30 minutes or so.  The game seems quite easy on the surface - you&#039;re playing cards and making decisions on 1 of 3 actions each turn, but you never really know what&#039;s in the deck - that is until your first round is complete.

See that&#039;s where the beauty lies in the game - you have an idea based on probabilities of what could be coming, but don&#039;t know for sure.  It&#039;s like a ninja is waiting beyond the gate, and you know it; but from which clan - the wannabes &quot;1&#039;s&quot; or the skilled &quot;4&#039;s&quot;.  But wait, perhaps you can know, that is if you use the samurai that has the power to see the card and decide to discard to the bottom of the deck.  Stand and fight, but don&#039;t get overwhelmed, otherwise your village starts to burn - and that&#039;s no good for anybody.

When you stand and fight you also have to decide if you&#039;re going to slot the card on your right or left side - left side is defensive, and if all 3 slots are not filled at the end of a round, you face a penalty.  Slot it on the right and the numbers start to accrue towards your maximum - and if you land on your max you get an extra power to use, if you go over, you barricades start to burn.  When you fight someone you also get assessed a penalty based on the card for the next draw, so that makes the choice a little harder (or perhaps you have a samurai that nullifies the even card penalties).

Once the first round is completed, you add in some additional enemies &quot;5&#039;s&quot; for the second round and &quot;6&#039;s&quot; for the third round.  If you can defeat them you win.

All I can say is WOW! Any way you slice this, it&#039;s one hell of a game, and as good as Friday is, this will be my go to filler game for a long time.

:thumbsup: Game play and artwork is excellent
:thumbsup: Box and insert fits perfectly and there&#039;s no wasted space
:thumbsdown: not enough people seem to be playing it on SGoYT

	<body>My last post got a little long, so I decided to add a short one here after my play tonight. 

Did a best of 7 against a pretty stacked AI team that only had a few defensive cards. He seemed to play them right at the best time. 

I lost the first 3 games and was in danger of losing the series, but some clear buys, and a dash of luck let me win my next 4 in a row! 

I gave myself 5 buy rounds, so I suppose this was &quot;easy&quot;, but my opponent could hammer out the runs...

Ive now played this three times, and I think the design is pretty cool. It doesn&#039;t exactly feel like I&#039;m managing a baseball team, but at the same time, the decisions sort of mirror what managers do, and I feel quite a bit of tension when I flip that last card from the AI, or my save attempt. 

Heck, the whole series came down to the past save attempt by the AI, which didn&#039;t do enough to keep me from winning by one! 

The more I play this, the more I think it&#039;ll easily replace Star Realms for a quick solo Deckbuilding(ish) game. This isn&#039;t really a traditional deck builder. I&#039;m still not sure if it&#039;s the theme that appeals to me so much, but I think the game play is pretty clever, and the mechanics are simple, but allow for some tactical and strategic flexibility and response.

More love for this game. I got to play a series with my brother while traveling this week and I was a bit surprised to find that I actually enjoyed soloing it a bit more. I think learning how to counter the AI deck over the course of the series is a fun mental exercise.

I am also enjoying this solo much more than I anticipated. Enough so that I went ahead and bought the expansion players so that once I think I&#039;ve totally figured it out I&#039;ll be able to retool the AI deck so it&#039;s pwning again. I originally bought it to play with my dad but I&#039;m pleasantly surprised at the solo challenge.

Even though it&#039;s only a six card hand per game there&#039;s crazy tension, heartache when your batters get zeroed or fist pumps when you empty the bases. Your run cushion is never large enough so every card you have to adjust your strategy for the most effect.....it&#039;s a thinker.

I bought the expansions too. I figured more cards was more than worth it. 

I agree about the tension. It&#039;s strange. It doesn&#039;t exactly play like a baseball game, but I feel similar tension. 

I also think the solo mode is ripe for a &quot;challenge&quot; by constructing specific AI decks to play against. I might try my hand at making some super teams to play against and see, but I think it could be fun. 

I&#039;m a bit upset to hear that the solo game is better than multiplayer, but it&#039;s because I keep thinking how fun it might be. I do love the fun puzzle each game. This last game, the AI had a ton of hits, bit only a few defensive plays, so I had to buy all the hit cancelling cards I could find! I even had a &quot;pitcher&#039;s duel&quot; game that ended with a 2 to 1 score.

One of the reasons I bought the extra cards was so I could set up different AI teams like Chris was saying. I&#039;m going to try multiplayer with my new to gaming dad which will tell me a lot about the ease of the game play.

[i]Non gaming who likes poker says this game is a keeper. When I told him that there were more expansion cards for players he said, &quot;I hope you ordered those too.&quot; Okay, now he likes two games, Camel Up and Baseball Highlights 2045. I told him I play the game solo and its the first time he has shown interest in a solo boardgame...the trap is sprung! I&#039;m set for Fathers Day![/i]

	<body>This was my pickup after returning my flawed copy of Onirim. I recently caught wind that this was the 200th anniversary of the battle and given my enjoyment of learning history and lack of knowledge about Napoleon&#039;s battles, I thought this would be a fun, inexpensive addition.

First thing noticed: Whoa, those are some small counters. I knew the game was a light production and the box felt as such, but only 74 small counters was surprising. Not a bad thing by any stretch. The overall production is simple, but attractive.

Second thing I notice: That player aid looks kind of detailed. Wait... that&#039;s the whole rulebook?! Again, I knew this was a relatively light game, but I figured there&#039;d be a bit more to it.

Third thing noticed: I wish there were a bit more history in the rulebook, but I suppose I can get that anywhere. Onward...

So I set it up and have played through 2 pretty quick turns. The game moves fast as it&#039;s just move/attack, move/attack alternating between French and Allied forces. So far, the Allies have successfully managed to contain Napoleon with reinforcements due out next turn. Already seems to be reflecting history, but you never know what Napoleon might have up his sleeve.

Or... you do.

[imageid=2405897]

[b]Update:[/b] I had to abort my first play due to getting the retreat rules wrong. I was giving both sides a major advantage by letting them retreat into enemy zones of control. I thought something didn&#039;t feel right.

So play 2 got underway and things felt much different. This game seems pretty stilted to the Allies, which I suppose makes sense. However, it doesn&#039;t feel impossible for the French to overcome the odds and push through. Victory is determined by who inflicts 40 strength point losses first, but Napoleon has to also get 7 units through the other end of the map. The Allies were victorious at turn 5. The map ended up looking like so:

[imageid=2407005 medium]

:thumbsup: Very easy to pick up and get going, but there is some thought involved in the way you maneuver your troops and utilize cover.

:thumbsdown::thumbsup: It is just a move and attack game. Simpler than chess when you get down to it.

I&#039;m hard pressed to think of other knocks against it. Overall, I&#039;m pretty happy. It&#039;s as advertised: a simple, fast-playing recreation of one of history&#039;s most famous battles. The tactics may not get more intricate than advance/hold/flank, but the tension of the &quot;will they or won&#039;t they break through?&quot; is there.</body>

The idea of cutting my eye teeth makes me all itchy.

	<body>Instead of sleeping in as fitting for a Saturday, my biorythm decided to stay on weekday mode, waking me at 5:40. Quiet time in the house and the chance for some reading (Am way too slow to get the THE MALAZAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN series read while my memory lasts to remember characters and events from earlier books :cool:, currently reading book 4), rules checking (finding out that I did play movement incorrect in PATHISTORY), brewing tea (a good 1st flush Darjeeling) and trying out the newest addition to my game collection.

Compared to ONIRIM, this feels like a walk in the park - not in terms of winning the game but in the hurt and pain along the way. There is a nice flow in this game once I remembered that icons need to be observed when playing a card. I like the discard and swatch mechanism - basically giving you the chance to bring out some cards here and there and then swap some to gain equilibrium in two cities at once.

I found it very easy to clear 10 cities in my two games and was then struggling to clear the final two (beimg one card short for the final city in my first game and having a complete mess in my second game). This tells me that I should aim to have maybe three cities left on the table for better swapping options. So, two losses to start with.

What I observed: when I draw a chaos card, I almost always discarded cards at an unbalanced city. Only once did I place it and I never chose the option of drawing and discarding four cards as this feels too expensive.

It seems that you&#039;re playing this rule wrong.  You can discard all cards only from an unclaimed BALANCED city upon drawing a Chaos card.

I have a strange relationship with that book series. 

I despised the first book when I read it, but I reread it and liked it more. The second one was decent, but I felt it dragged way too much. The third was kind of cool, but the grimdark stuff got a bit annoying.

So I stopped reading. But now that I think about it, it does some really cool stuff. I feel I should keep reading, and that I liked it. But it also annoys me.

The first book got me completely hooked - even though quite some story strands were opened quite suddenly. Only in the third book have some been shed with more light, helping me to grasp some background. What I really struggle with, in the speed I am reading the books, have been some quick changes in the narrative, some half dozen strands and ten times as many characters to follow. This is not made easier with the more demanding English vocabulary.

In some parts I also thought the second book dragged a bit long. In retrospect it was an awesome story of the struggle of the chain of dogs. Felt like a constant tower defense game on the move (which would be a cool idea to turn into a game).

These books share the basic atmosphere of A Game of Thrones: a deep world, deep characters who all have their good and dark sides. And who are all in danger of dying on the next page... :sauron: Really looking forward to the remaining 6 books (which are all published already - take that, G.R.R Martin! :) )

Oh, did I read that rule incorrectly? Would make the game tougher, for sure. :D

I like the depth of the world. There&#039;s a lot going on, and I like how the story is gradually revealed. Thus is something the I also think is really well done in Sanderson&#039;s Stormlight Archive. 

What I don&#039;t like is that it&#039;s obviously written based off their Rpg campaign. Anomander Rake is a dumb character. He&#039;s a grimdark emo elf with a giant sword that captures souls in it. Oh, and he can turn into a dragon (when it&#039;s convenient to the plot), though he doesn&#039;t frequently. The concept is cool, but it just obvious he&#039;s an NPC from their stories. 

The Chain of Dogs was OK, but it just went on for about 200 too many pages. They get attacked, and they run. Then the flee some more. And the situation is bad. And it&#039;s so bad. And things are awful. It&#039;s just a bit too heavy handed. 

I think the problem is that Erickson isn&#039;t a great writer. He creates cool stories and a great world, and a few cool characters (and some genuinely stupid ones..... Don&#039;t get me started on Kruppe), but his actual ability to craft that together into a well paced story is lacking. 

As much as I complain, it&#039;s still better than a lot of the other drivel out there. I read Cephrael&#039;s Hand, and it was trash. Just so bad. It, seriously, used the word &quot;verily&quot; in the narration. The  a few pages later, used the phrase &quot;who is the broad?&quot;.

Sounds like a great (albeit early) Saturday morning.

I&#039;ve had this game on my shelf for a couple of years now.  Got it at the same time as Onirim and I play that one all the time.  I think I&#039;ve been too lazy to sit down and read the rules to figure out how to play Urbion.  Thanks for the reminder, this one is now moving up on my list.

	<body>Based mainly on seeing it on SGOYT, this game rocketed to the top of my wishlist over the last year, and I was lucky enough to receive a very nice trade with another 1-Player Guild member shortly after Christmas. Tonight, I finally got it onto the table. I decided to ramp up the complexity by adding in the expansions one at a time, so my first game used only base game components.

I randomly received the Druid, Seer, Prince, and Scholar characters. I was honestly not too thrilled with this lineup, since they didn&#039;t promise to be that great at combat, but I stuck with them anyway. For the first few rounds, the Seer and Scholar moved up into the mountains and searched (uncovering two keys very quickly), while the Druid defeated a Blight in the Village. Later one, the heroes all gravitated toward the Castle to try to beef up their skills. The Prince came VERY close to death at one point, only surviving by rolling a 6 on his event-initiated combat. Once the Scholar found the Ancient Sword and Find Weakness, he moved to the Ruins, clearing them out, while the Seer brought him the last key. Combining the three keys, the Scholar grabbed a Holy Relic while the other heroes grouped at the Ruins to serve as his backup. The Prince Inspired him, and then the Scholar&#039;s Event draw (Ritual) brought the Necromancer right to his feet. Rolling three dice, he got two 6s, which easily killed the Necromancer with the bonuses from Holy Relic and Ancient Sword. Since the Ruins was clear of Blights, that won me the game with the Darkness track at 20.

This game definitely lived up to my expectations. I love the style of the visuals and the overall mood, and a lot of the mechanics (Map cards, the way Powers work) are really clever. I do feel like some of the heroes I had in my party were difficult/unintuitive to use, especially the Seer, who had a lot of great powers but never seemed to shine.</body>

Byron, I&#039;m curious how you store the blights. Do you have them all mixed up in a plastic bag? Is it easy to just dump them in a pile on the table and find what you need?

I have mine in a GMT counter tray, but it takes up a good amount of space in the box (I only have the normal box).

Thanks for asking, as that is my one complaint about the game. I have all the blights in a plastic bag, and it does take some digging to find the right one. I think a few minutes spreading out the pile and flipping them face up before the game would save me a lot of trouble next time.

Hmmm, maybe I&#039;ll keep the counter tray and spring for the collector&#039;s box. VPG sells an empty box the size of the Necromancer Bundle&#039;s box. Right now I have the main game, and both expansion boxes holding stuff. It drives me crazy to have multiple boxes to hold one game. 

But more importantly, thanks for reminding me why I was interested in this game in the first place. :)

Was about to get this one down off the shelf, when I felt the pull of my brand new copy of [thing=144566][/thing], begging for a de-sooting. There&#039;s an ad for Darkest Night in the box... and something called Tenka, which looks like it needs further investigation.

When I heard about Circus Train on the Long View podcast, it definitely caught my attention, but the price has been a deterring factor so far. From the way they described it, it sounded a bit like [thing=140620][/thing] in the way that you have to carefully time your stops to avoid paying your crew, and also like [thing=27746][/thing] (but soloable, which is intriguing).

Unless I get a cheaper polybag game, I think Circus Train will be my next VPG game.

Circus Train is ok. Lewis and a Clark does what it does better, I think.

Shouldn&#039;t be too long of a way, they have the printers there. Most of the stuff they sell is print on demand.

	<body>(vs. Automa)

[b]Defeat[/b]
Me: 20
Automa: 20

In my third solo session of Viticulture, I did much better than in the previous two.  However, I still came up short of victory, tying Automa at 20.  I did not play with the moving Automa VPs or aggressive option, preferring to win one before moving on.

What I did differently in this session was focus on a single plan based primarily around what I got from the Mama and Papa at the start of the game.  In this case, it was a spring visitor and two wine orders from the Mama, and $2 and a Tasting Room/$5 from the Papa.  I chose the Tasting room figuring that it would be worth 6-7 VP over the course of the game, assuming I could get into the tour space almost every turn.

What I didn&#039;t have at the start was a vine card, so I had to draw one of those with my first wake-up action.  It required a Trellis, but fortunately, the initial spring visitor was an Architect.  I used him to build a Cottage for just $1 then paid $2 to build a Trellis, having given a tour with my first action.  This used all three of my workers, however.

I never managed to get a fourth worker, which I&#039;m pretty sure was the difference between victory and defeat in this session.  I believe that I built too many structures -- I should have forgone the Cottage and used that money for a fourth worker instead.  The extra visitor cards I drew using the Cottage did help my cause, but I think a fourth worker for most of the game would have helped more.  As it was, I had to forgo giving a tour twice in the game, including the final turn, because I needed that worker elsewhere.

I was fortunate for most of the game in the Automa worker placements.  In the first half of the game, they were rarely in my way or even nonexistent, but in the latter turns, they did cause some trouble, limiting my options.  Automa did not limit my options as much as my lack of a fourth worker did.

I kept my focus on fulfilling the wine orders I had, one of which required a large cellar.  Getting the money for this and then building it took too many actions; again, I think I would have been better served by forgoing the Cottage and saving my money for other stuff.  Just one additional big wine order would have gotten me as many points as I gained from the Cottage, for instance.  I didn&#039;t fulfill any until the last two turns, however.  I simply didn&#039;t have the workers to do more.

On turn 6, I fulfilled a big order for 6 VP.  The on the final turn, sitting on 15 VP, I did a second order for 3 VP and used a winter visitor (The Judge?) to give up a medium wine for 2 VP.  This got me to 20 and a tie with Automa.

In my next session, I am going to spend some time at the start thinking about what I got from the Mama and Papa and how I can parlay that head start into points.  It&#039;s becoming clear to me that it is best to go in the direction their &quot;legacy&quot; pushes you toward.  They provide a head start of some sort, but the challenge for someone new to the game like myself is to figure out what path you&#039;ve been started on and how best to follow it efficiently.

I am quite impressed with this design, and I was not at all certain I would be.  I took the plunge on the purchase only after exhaustive due diligence through myriad reviews and videos, but the devil is always in my personal perception of the gameplay details.  I find the game very clean; the mechanics are simple, and the options not overwhelming, but there are many meaningful choices to make, each with long-term implications.  The game rewards thoughtful planning ahead; scoring usually happens in bursts in the latter part of the game after various elements come to fruition.  The trick is getting the components of a scoring move to come together at the right time while having the necessary workers and open action slots available to make it happen.   That this all fits intuitively with the theme of winemaking (a time-intensive, long-term process) is a huge strength of the design.

The &quot;legacy&quot; style expansions in Tuscany are another great element, providing something to shoot for in solo play; win a particular set up often enough, and you are ready to change the game with a new expansion tier, giving you a different set of parameters to mull over and master.  The full package of base game and expansion is certainly a big expense, but so far anyway, it seems to offer more than sufficient bang for the bucks.</body>

I&#039;m still trying to figure out a solid strategy for this one too. I started a Tuscany campaign, but so far I haven&#039;t been able to get past the first stage. My highest score was 19. It is such a great game though and I hope to get it to the table this week after a bit of a hiatus.

It took me four tries to beat the 20-point Automa score for 1 expansion (Mamas &amp; Papas).

The solitaire targets are tough.  I&#039;m learning the importance of optimizing efficiency.  All those leftover wine and grape tokens at the end of the game represent wasted efforts.

In my first few multi-player games I put off getting wine order cards because there is so much else that needs to be accomplished.  Perhaps wine order cards are needed earlier than I thought to allow for targeting of my efforts and optimizing efficiency.

Yeah, efficiency is the key to beating the AI. The &quot;easy&quot; AI also gets easier to beat the more expansions are added. 

Here are some tips from my ... apparently 13 plays of Viticulture thus far, heading into Tier 3 of the campaign. 

1. Draw vine cards ASAP so you know the order of building the two vine-related structures, the trellis and irrigation. You will typically need both in the end, but figuring out which to build first so you can plant as early as possible (and thus harvest as early as possible) is vital. 

2. Draw wine order cards ASAP as well. If you luck out you might get ones that only require a medium cellar, which means you can optimize filling wine orders sooner. Otherwise you&#039;ll know that you need to find a way to get the large cellar in. 

3. Visitor cards are also vital for gaining the odd VPs here and there and being able to execute actions that you&#039;re blocked from by the AI (for instance, I highly cherish winter visitors that allow me to fill a wine order. It means that I can possibly fill two wine orders in one year. I also really like the ones that allow me to do one thing and draw another visitor card or draw another wine order card. 

4. Make sure you&#039;re playing all the rules correctly. Remember:
  - when harvesting, do not remove your vines. they stay on the fields.
  - do not reset your residual income to zero at the end of the year. 
  - age both your grapes and your wines.
  - on the regular board, always pick up a visitor card when passing to the second half of the year. 

5. When playing on the regular board (as opposed to the extended board) your bonus tokens should aim towards harvesting more than one field typically. 

6. The earlier you begin to produce grapes, the better your chances of filling wine orders that require very &quot;old&quot; reds and whites. Also you&#039;ll have more grapes, which will allow you to create blushes and especially sparkling wines. 

7. If playing with Mamas and Papas (which you should be, because otherwise Automa punches you and takes your lunch lira) try to build strategies around what your papa and mama give you. 

 - Papa gives you a trellis or irrigation. Get a head start on planting vines. 

 - Papa gives you a medium cellar. You are fortunate, and look out for visitor cards in winter that will allow you to upgrade your cellar for cheaper than 6 lira 

 - Papa gives you a cottage. This is great because you draw an extra visitor every year. This will widen your opportunities for practically everything. 

 - Papa gives you a windmill. Try to plant often to get VPs (1 max per year). It seems small, but it gives you VPs to burn to pay for uncertified teachers or oneologists. You can always go to negative VPs of course but the windmill gives you a cushion. 

 - Mama gives you wine order cards. If they are good ones (4 - 6 VPs, lean towards 6 VPs) then build your strategy around getting them delivered early since those are card draw actions you no longer have to take. 

 - Mama gives you visitor cards. Similar to the cottage situation, except you get the boost earlier and it doesn&#039;t last as long. 

 - Mama gives you vine cards. Get a head start on planting them. 

That&#039;s what I can think of, off the top of my head at the moment. 

[b]ETA:[/b] Get a harmonious mix of vines in the fields. If you can do it: 

1 field with high sum of either red or white grapes. These will get you higher quality wines faster for the &quot;big and old&quot; wine orders (like 6 red, 8 white, etc). 

2 fields with a mix of red and white grapes. These will allow you to create blushes, sparklers, and fill 3-wine orders faster.

	<body>I am fascinated by WWII and I got Memoir 44 as a way to experience some of the history, even if it is in a slightly abstracted way. However, I haven&#039;t really found anyone to play it with me. When I first got the game, in 2011, I tried it out on a few people but nobody really enjoyed it. I&#039;ve kept the game, though, hoping that my son might play it with me when he&#039;s older. It&#039;s funny to me, because I am pretty quick to get rid of games that don&#039;t get played. Yet, I&#039;ve held on to Memoir. 

Seeing it show up on SGOYT inspired me to play it solo. I wasn&#039;t sure the best way to go about it though. I&#039;d read that there are a few solo methods, but [b][user=Ad79]Stig[/user][/b], who&#039;s played this a bunch, told me I should just play both sides. So I did. 

I&#039;ve played the first three scenarios so far, Pegasus Bridge, Sainte MÃ¨re-Ãglise, and Sword Beach. This has been a good start. The game is very fun solo and it&#039;s very interesting trying to play both sides at once. I do feel like I have a bias toward the Allies, so I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m not playing the Axis side as best as I can. The Allies have won every time, and I&#039;m afraid I (the Axis) let them. I&#039;m sure that I will get the hang of it though. 

It&#039;s also really great how the different scenarios actually feel different. From first glance, it seems that the Memoir system is capable of some great and varied stuff. I should probably say Command and Colors system because that seems to spawn so many different games (and it&#039;s the first, I think).

[b]Edit:[/b] Battle Cry was the first, not C&amp;C. Thanks Ava! </body>

Battle Cry was the first in the C&amp;C series. They taught me a lot about historical battles, especially Ancients. I had never heard of Cannae before.

When I solo this I also have a bias, but mine is different. I am biased towards whatever side historically lost the battle. I love an underdog.

Very easy to play solo.  Just draw 3 cards, use 1 and discard.  Put the other 2 into a reuse stack.  Shuffle the reuse stack to form new draw pile until they are all gone, then shuffle all cards (now discarded) to form draw pile.

Then there is no advance knowledge of what the other &quot;side&quot; has.

Thanks Kevin, that sounds like a good way to do it. I had been thinking to just draw one card, but that could end up with some very poor play by the other side. But with three cards, I can pick the best for the situation without having advanced knowledge, like you said. 

Could you explain the reuse pile some more? I&#039;m not quite grasping it.

Sure... you have three piles. 

DRAW
DISCARD (used cards)
REUSE (unused, but drawn cards)

You draw 3 from the draw pile and the one that gets played goes into the discard.  The other two were never actually &quot;used&quot; and should have a chance to be used before the discards come back into play.  So I put them in a different pile.  When the draw pile is gone, you&#039;ll have discards and reuse piles left.  You cycle through the reuse cards again to insure the balance of card distribution isn&#039;t messed up.  Only when the draw and reuse stacks are depleted (meaning they are ALL in the discard pile) do you reshuffle the discards.

This works great here, but was imperative in [thing=128204][/thing] where each side can only use their cards once (once through the draw pile)

Got it.  That makes perfect sense.  Thanks!  What about when a card tells you to shuffle the discard pile back into the draw pile?  (I forget which one does it.)  Do you leave the reuse pile alone? Or do you shuffle everything together and start a new reuse pile?

I would shuffle them all at that point, because the goal of the card is to restore all cards back to the draw pile (in a normal game)

	<body>Back to this little beauty, this afternoon. Once I got over the easy set-up and momentary stickiness of &quot;Um, how do I play this, again?&quot; I was soon sorting through all the delve packs and promos that I snagged at Christmas. 

So, of course, I ended up playing a couple of games with just the base set cards. :shake:

Quickest I&#039;ve ever taken down Greenknee - which, of course, means I may have misremembered a rule or two. And I think I need to check all the delve pack cards - I have a feeling I&#039;m missing one or two. There&#039;s a job for tomorrow. 

Lovely game, and it&#039;s great to see it appear on these lists more and more. </body>

	<body>[b]We have a tie![/b]

Prior to playing CC:E, I only had one other game rated at â9â on my list, and that was [thing=1608]Ambush[/thing].  After implementing [filepage=108109]Domostie&#039;s Solo Variant[/filepage] on CC:E, I now have two.  Although ambush probably edges CC:E out a bit, since it was designed purely for solo play, CC:E has enough flavor, theme, and solo surprises to be right behind it.  In the long run, it might have more, since there is more replayability.

[b]Scenario:[/b] Startup intro scenario (designed to introduce the game mechanics)
Germans: AI defenders
Russians: Me (attackers)

[b]Time: 0[/b]
-Russians off to a good start with the infantry gun crew breaking Sgt Ganz and his rifle squad with a long range attack down the tree-lined road.  Sgt Ganz is routed for a one-hex retreat out of Objective #3, but his rifle squad rallies.
-The Russian Guards Rifle squads make their way through the forest to the treeline opposite emplaced German squad in house (Objective #5).  German LMG takes opportunity fire and breaks one Russian squad.
-Time!

[imageid=2406464]

[b]Time: 1[/b]
-Russians dig in along the treeline, but a squad is broken by that pesky LMG in OBJ #5.
-SGT Ganz rallies, and one of two Russian squads rally.
-German LMG squad dig a foxhole in the treeline, but still take a hit from the Russian Infantry Gun.  Germans play a âlight woundâ to avoid breaking (but take a 1 VP hit).
-SGT Kaminsky orders a 3 hex firing group against the German LMG in OBJ #3, resulting in suppressing the German squad, but the Germans return fire, suppressing the northern most Russian Guards Rifle squad.
-SGT K makes the same group order, but the Germans play another âlight woundsâ to avoid the break!
-SGT K orders a rush of OBJ #3 across the road, but they are hit with opportunity fire and receive a mass Russian suppression event!
-SGT K rallies his squad and the infantry gun tries to cover them, but suffers an event and the gun breaks, followed by a german sniper completely taking out the gun!  Not good for the Russians.
-SGT K tries one more group fire on the German LMG.  Hits, but the germans keep getting âlight woundsâ to avoid breaking.
-Time!

[b]Time:2[/b]
-The Russian weapons crew (sans weopan since infantry gun gone) try to make it across the road.  They are entangled in wire and face opportunity fire, and â¦ Time!

[b]Time:3[/b]
-Russian weapons crew entangles from the wire, but right into a minefield.  Fortunately no damage taken.
-SGT Ganz orders his Germans into melee, completely destroying a Russian squad.  SGT K takes advantage of the Germans vacating OBJ #3, moving in but a squad breaks on the road from opportunity fire from that LMG in the house.
-SGT K and LMG make it to OBJ #1.  Russians making slow progress.
-Time! Sudden Death rollâ¦game continues

[b]Time: 4[/b]
-Russian sniper breaks the German LMG squad in OBJ #5, but SGT Ganz breaks another Guard Rifle squad with an attack.
-German rifle team makes a rush across the open field, diving into foxholes and popping smoke along the way.  Face opportunity fire, but the Russians miss from the smoke and foxhole cover.  Event!
-German hero appears!  He breaks a Guards rifle squad and moves into OBJ #2.
-Time! Sudden Death rollâ¦.game continues.

[b]Time: 5[/b]
-Russian sniper breaks SGT Ganz and Russian squad sprints across field to a foxhole, but are broken by opportunity fire just prior to jumping in.
-SGT Ganz rallies and German sniper breaks Russian Guards Rifle squad in OBJ #3.
-Germans play âhidden unitâ and a German HMG Crew enters play.  German rifle squad becomes a veteran unit, as does one Russian Guards Rifle squad.
-Time!  Sudden Death rollâ¦game continues.

[b]Time: 6[/b]
-Russian LMG eliminated!
Time! Sudden Death rollâ¦Game over

After 7 rounds, German AI wins with 32 VPs

You probably canât really follow along with this AAR, but I hope I was able to express some of the [b][size=18]chaotic fun[/size][/b] that can be had with this great game and a good solo variant.

From my playing of CC:E, I don&#039;t see that the variant is really required too much.  The only issue is opportunity fire and you&#039;re gonna play a real opponent as if he probably has it, so just play the same way against yourself.  &quot;Would I move this way if I thought he had op fire card?&quot;

But still, the variant looks interesting.

I agree, it&#039;s easy to just draw cards face down and Op Fire if it makes sense.  With the dice rolls and stuff, there&#039;s not that much that needs to stay hidden.  

I mean, it makes a difference in multiplayer, but with solo, it&#039;s just as easy to play both sides like I do with most wargames.

I agree, it&#039;s easy to just draw cards face down and Op Fire if it makes sense.  With the dice rolls and stuff, there&#039;s not that much that needs to stay hidden.  

I mean, it makes a difference in multiplayer, but with solo, it&#039;s just as easy to play both sides like I do with most wargames.[/q]

All good points.  When learning the rules, I played both sides normally against &quot;myself&quot; and it was enjoyable.  I do that with a lot of games, but I never get the sense of &quot;winning or losing&quot;.  I generally just feel like I am being a neutral party or referee.

The variant provided a bit more feeling of playing a side.  The opponents deck gets quite large with many more options to make it difficult to fight against.  If they are able to use an opportunity fire, it is usually pretty devastating since they generally have a lot of + modifiers available. For that reason, I think the variant works for me.

	<body>I am continuing my solo campaign, and this time I am playing SIDE MISSION [o]Viper&#039;s Den[/o]

[imageid=2406597large]

The rebels are ready, and everything is cat and baby-proof, so, in-between session, nothing will move, as white tac is keeping everything in place.

[b]EDIT on February 14th:[/b]

I played the mission today, and the rebels lost.

The Imperials just hit and hit again.
The E-web engineer just kept on shooting.
The Automated Imperial player didn&#039;t bother on getting the broken droid, and waited until the rebels opened the door [o]and when Fenn blasted the door open, more stormtoopers arrived, along with an elite officer, which made things worst[/o]

Fenn got the disk, and ran away, but was shot down, just short of escaping.


The scenario has some rules flaws, especially about how to gain the disk, and if it requires an action or not.
I played as if it did, but I am not sure I played it correctly.

The Tardashan hunters (are they called like that?) are TOUGH!!!  I really hope not to encounter them!

Thanks Byron.
I will post pics of the complete painted set also, when I actually take proper pics.

And, BTW, talk about &quot;cat-proof&quot;, this morning I woke up and my cat was playing with one of the crates (fortunately the cardboard token wasn&#039;t bitten) and all the walls were shill over the place... Oh well... At least the miniatures weren&#039;t hurt.


I will not post a full session report with pictures, though, this time, as it takes me ages.
I will write a short session report, though, when I finish the mission.

Even if it&#039;s not entirely cat-proof (call it &quot;cat-resistant&quot; :) ) I like your idea of tacking stuff down like that.

	<body>I played two games so far.

Game 1: A two handed two player game - Barbarians vs. Romans.
I almost got all of the rules right. I messed up the Raze-your opponent&#039;s-house rule - I forgot to give the razee wood and turn the card over. I just discarded it. I also thought Deals were made by paying gold instead of food.
The Barbarians got off really well. They had a lot of population and also bonuses for razing. 
The Romans were very slow to get a momentum going, but their last turn was fantastic. They managed to build a lot of their locations.
The Barbarians got a lot of VPs throughout the game, but Romans managed a draw.
37 vs 37

Game 2: The solitaire rules playing the Barbarians.
I thought I was pretty good, so I tried going against the AI. I had a really bad first turn in which I built just one location. I also made too many deals (which &quot;wasted&quot; my faction cards) and didn&#039;t generate a card-drawing combo. I had lots of resources, but nothing worthy to build. And I had lots of common buildings which made razing by the AI easy.
I lost 3 to 7 (and had 27 VPs).

I understand the game a bit more.

:thumbsup:Simple rules, buy a deep game underneath.
:thumbsup:Lots of replayability, with four very different factions and different ways to score points.
:thumbsup:Challenging AI and the published campaign mode.
:thimbsup:I keep thinking about it.
:thumbsdown:I keep thinking about it.</body>

	<body>I went on the tutorial missio  but with my own soldier choices.

NINJA STYLE.

[imageid=2406615]

every thing went smoothly except i couldnt get a location for 4 draws so that killed many rounds.  How do you like my mini soldier ;).

[imageid=2406617]

i am really enjoying this game and i actually liked picking my skills and equipment for my ninja.  I almost won but ran out of time because of the location search at the beginning.  It came to the final role vs the boss.  Ineed 2 kills.

Usually, the shorter missions allow you to Recon the Action Deck for a location card if you don&#039;t have one to start, which fixes the problem you encountered.

	<body>I played three games testing the third abductor pack.

I felt this one really changes the game. I was really surprised how those few cards can really make the game feel different. This applies to the previous ones as well (they have their entires on BGG now - [thing=172637]Abductor Pack 1[/thing] and [thing=172638]Abductor Pack 2[/thing] by the way).

I can&#039;t say much more, but it is hard as hell :-) I really enjoyed the games and I will certainly be playing more.

[b]Edit 2014.02.14:[/b] I played another four games a few days ago. I was crushed three times and had one really close one, but also lost.
Time to play with some modifications.</body>

Funny!  I played three games of AP3 today too.  :whistle:

Lost the first two.  Won the third play.  I don&#039;t know anything about the first two APs, so I can&#039;t compare this one to those.  But I agree, it does change the game up...which was my main hope for the packs.

I really like the theme of AP3 as well.  And the additional game mechanism is interesting.

I want to play it some more before making any further comments/judgements though.

It was quite [b]lucky[/b] - I needed two successes on two dice with no modifiers, and I got it.  Otherwise, it would have been a loss.  So, don&#039;t be too impressed.  :laugh:

	<body>I played this a few weeks ago with the box heros, going for a thematic deck since this is a saga expansion after all and I got creamed.  Gave it a few more tries and then put it away after I picked up a few other APs.  

Picked it back up last night and played a couple rounds with my all-star deck featuring Spirit Glorfindel, Haldir and Theodred.  Got completed destroyed in just a few rounds.  Thought perhaps it was just bad luck with the encounter deck so I tried again and got the same result.  Frustrated, I got on the BGG LOTR LCG forums and was reminded (doh!) of the recommended deck list on the back of the rule book.

Played again this morning with the recommended deck and I did get a win.  It was tense though, those black riders and hide tests really do keep you at the edge of your seat.  It was great! 

:thumbsup: If you love LOTR books and want to relive them LCG-style, this is the expansion for you.  
:thumbsup: You only need it, plus 1 copy of the core set, so doesn&#039;t require dropping a ton of money to play successfully.
:thumbsdown: It&#039;s kinda hard for a newbie.

One thing I have to keep reminding myself when I play this game - or any of the LOTR LCG quests - is to read every card carefully.  I find myself regularly making rules mistakes because I forgot one little detail on a quest card, or I miss a &quot;when revealed&quot; effect.  Gotta slow down.</body>

That is true and probably a lot of problems are solved that way. In fact I found that the whole game made a lot more sense when I understood that everything should be read word after word and actions executed sentence after sentence. Then the only difficulty resides in understanding and playing &quot;revealed&quot; correctly.

That expansion is very tempting for me. I find the black riders an aesthetically striking view (I have a weakness for goth designs and am a bit of a horseman) and would love to find the playmat with that illustration on it.

I guess my background in magic helped here. Cards are resolved in order, and sentences always are separate actions. I guess I was trained early in that and never think about it.

	<body>Another attempt at the [thread=1312771]Star Realms Challenge #3[/thread].

Started with Brain World &amp; Supply Bot - reportedly the easiest starting combo, and this shows on the Hi Scores.
Won the game :) - but with 33 pts, this is the worst score for this combo so far :whistle:

[b][i]Squads 1-10[/b][/i]; Seemed like an stream of Folorn Hopes, delivering slowly increasing stirkes, but the Beast was eating mainly Trade ships, so growing in size as well as strength.

[b][i]Squad 11[/b][/i]; (Fleet 13 - Beast 49)
This wave was initially a mix of StarFleet and Blob ships.  Each called for reinforcements - who in turn called forward yet more ships and/or bases, including a Machine Cult Stealth Needle (emulating a Blob Destroyer).  The combined fleet mustered a a 31 strength attack and earned 4 authority.

[i]Plans were discussed about scrapping 2 bases to generate an additional 10 attack, but as the Commander couldn&#039;t remember what was in reserve, and so couldn&#039;t estimate the next attack this was deemed too risky.[/i]

[b][i]Squad 12[/b][/i]; (Fleet 15 - Beast 18)
The battle now seemed winnable, battle logs were not well maintained in the excitement other than Squad 12 had 10 attack strength and could have slain the Beast had the Commander scrapped those bases during the previous attack.

[b][i]Squad 13[/b][/i]; (Fleet 7 - Beast 8)
Another squadron with a majority of Blob representation, delivering an overkill strike of 34.

:thumbsup: The more this is played the more the game, partly due to range of cards and artwork, pushes Ascension: Apprentice Edition aside.
:thumbsdown: If it weren&#039;t for Shaun&#039;s Challenges (with house-rules) this wouldn&#039;t hit the table as often.  [i]In fact the (full) App version with live opponents could replace this otherwise.[/i]

Edit: Added link.</body>

I really enjoy Shaun&#039;s creative challenges and am glad that they&#039;ll still be around for me to try later on. However, every time I think of playing one, I decide to do something else instead. I think I&#039;m just at a point in this game that I&#039;d rather do the simple, straightforward solo mode. But Shaun&#039;s challenges are definitely :star::star::star: quality.

	<body>This is on my 15x15 list and hadn&#039;t been played this year... decided to get it out after seeing a short tactics discussion in another entry this month.

[b]Level 2 Won; 78 pts[/b] (and a Personal Best)
Fight +35, -10.  Life +40.  Pirates +30.  Hazard -18.

I wasn&#039;t paying attention to the life pool, just that it didn&#039;t seem to run down too quickly this game.  I entered the Red Phase with 10 life in hand - which I have done before, and still died in the last couple of fights before meeting the Pirates on the beach.

This game I had won most of the eating/feeding cards - and got lucky in some fights when Aging cards were setting me up for a loss, along would come a Destroy card.

This allowed Robinson to step on the beach with 7 life in hand, ready to face off against #5 @ 14 Strength (based on ageing cards used) &amp; #6 @ 20 Strength.  [i]The Aging/Destroy luck continued here, otherwise Pirates may have won.[/i]

This technique is generally too damaging for board game cards, try overhand shuffling instead - ideally with sleeves.

Meh.  You need to do it a few billion times to see any damage.

	<body>Back from an evening out, and found this still on the table... seemed rude not to allow it a parting shot, given the time taken to refresh the rules. Played the beginner game, basic decks, looking for two succesfsul quests. Randomly drew Evil Has a Name (put the named villain - in this basic set, the &quot;mascot&quot; Greenknee - into the ground) and perennial favourite The Damsel. Final quest was the somewhat tricky The Stars Are Aligned (the dungeon deck of that round bears card values of 0, 1, 2 and 3). 

Played to a bloody but fairly swift win, tonight; I at first thought I was going to walk into the Stars quest, as the first three draws gave me cards valued at 0 to 2 consecutively - with another 2 card having to sit on the deck. I didn&#039;t have the equipment cards to allow me to get to creative with the dungeon, so I couldn&#039;t sustain the win conditions... Two rounds later Greenknee popped up, with his summons command and annoying stealth. A light spell let me find him in the dark corridor - and I put him into the grave within three rounds. When I finally discovered The Damsel, she was surrounded by non-aggressive terrain cards, leading to a quick breather for my final hero, who walked out of the dungeon with the maiden, Greenknee&#039;s teeth, and more dignity than I can usually muster.

Keep it up! Enough more of these posts might inspire me to pull out my base copy of the game and give it a try (it&#039;s been languishing in a cupboard since I bought it when it first came out; a few years now?).
I liked the idea of the game, but the artwork and graphic design puts me off.

Nice job, Jason, you&#039;re keeping this at the top of my list.  If this thing ever showed up in auction lists more often, i surely would have gotten it by now.

It does seem a little discouraging that the rules require so much &quot;refreshing&quot;.

There are a lot of keywords, and some of the rules aren&#039;t that intuitive, so it can take a refresher. 

After you struggle with it in the initial learn (which can be tough), the refresher shouldn&#039;t be too bad.

I have a head like a sieve, to be honest. The best thing the designer did is put those quick flash tutorials on their website. They are a brilliant learning tool - and actually show how easy the game is to play; it was more an initial issue of parsing the rulebook. 

Can&#039;t recommend this one enough.

	<body>I [i]finally[/i] got my shipping confirmation for this yesterday or the day before, and it arrived today! I&#039;ll certainly be giving it a play or two today, in addition to wanting to replay Darkest Night. Kicking myself a bit that I didn&#039;t plump for the Deluxe version, but there&#039;s still plenty of variety in the retail box...

[b][size=14]Update:[/size][/b]

Hey, that was fun! :D

I played my first game on Normal difficulty (2 Dire Enemies) using the standard solo setup (2 heroes). I randomly drew the Warrior and Paladin, and used the original side of all the regions. The Dire Enemies turned out to be the Wraith and the Minotaur, while my Epic Foe was the Demon Lord. I was so scared to attack him (he reduces your health to 1 whenever you attack) that I almost lost the game. Luckily, I realized just in time that I could deal up to 3 damage to him in one turn, which was way more important than keeping my health up to defend the regions.

I really like how the importance of the different regions changes throughout the game. In the initial deck, there were no enemies attacking the Coast or Desert, so I got used to ignoring them...and then the Coast was destroyed before I knew it. I did find some of the rules/abilities a little vague, but overall, this is a great little game. Feels like much more than a microgame.</body>

Byron, seems we&#039;re on the same game schedule (or at least I&#039;m trying, if not for fedex).  My first kickstarter, and it arrived last week!  

I haven&#039;t played solo, but did break it out for 3 games with my son.  I think it will be a better solo game than [thing=65532][/thing] and [thing=30549][/thing], because of the strong similarity of gameplay in a fraction of the cost, time, and footprint.  But as a group game, it might be a little cramped.  Will be interesting to see which one i keep longterm.

Second scenario for my group of 2 with my own Pathfinder variant I describe [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312765/my-own-variant]here[/url].

I was quite lucky on this game. Lini disarmed the first poison trap on her first turn and close the Town Square. I think, she disarmed all the poison traps by herself with the help of her crows. And well, this ability is quite amazing. She manage to recharge all her cure except one at the end. And she defeated Pillbug Podiker twice. Only Valeros had some difficulties, against a Mercenary and a Shadow in particular.

I like the look of your variant, although it is certainly complex.

I am playing my own variant at the moment and have played four scenarios with it so far. I need to write it up. It is fascinating how many variants there are that look good. I think anyone could make one that suits them based on the different ideas in all the variants, and there is a wide range of complexity too for all tastes.

	<body>This is a game I&#039;ve been looking forward to and it met my hopes and expectations. 

I&#039;ve enjoyed [thing=43710]Pocket Cricket[/thing], a fast playing game that reflects the shorter form of cricket. This new game brings features that add significantly to the tactics of play. They provide both the bowler and the batsman with new choices without straining the basic simplicity of the system.

I can see that I&#039;m going to have to be careful with these [company=17797]Pocket Sports[/company] products. I just received their [thing=168578]baseball[/thing] and [thing=168577]boxing[/thing] products, as well, and am a bit concerned that they&#039;ll distract me from my main challenges for the year. :(

My first play through gave me a pretty good feel for the flow of the game, though I&#039;m going to have to get it out a few more times before I&#039;m confident about the match-ups. In any case, lots of fun for the armchair cricket fan.:D</body>

	<body>So I had a good gaming session tonight and didn&#039;t feel like posting all of them separately, so here they are:

[b]Fleet with Arctic Bounty [/b]- played the solo variant posted on the geek instead of the one with the expansion tonight.  I had a CRAZY score on this, beating the AI 152 to 51 - how&#039;s that possible with only 50 cubes you ask - well I ended up getting all Canadian licenses, which made each cube on those vessels worth 3 points each, so that was 9 per boat, and I had a large fleet of those alongside some shrimp boats which helped to keep the AI out of contention for the auction.

[b]At the Gates of Loyang [/b]- I wanted to try my hand at this tonight, and farms were running well, but I managed to upset a few regular customers which hurt my chances.  I was able to pull out a 17.5, which is right around average for me.

[b]Paperback [/b]- To me this is one of the most enjoyable deckbuilders to play because every turn is a new word puzzle.  In the solo variant you&#039;re working your way up the pyramid which top tier cards getting harder to acquire.  I built my deck around a few cards that allowed me to score wild cards, and then added a few more that increased my draw, but I was unlucky in the last few rounds and fell short of the 17 points needed to get the win

[b]Samurai Spirit[/b] - My latest acquisition, and such a great game. I managed to pull off a win tonight on normal mode.  A few more times and I think I&#039;m going to ratchet up the difficulty to Hard.</body>

I&#039;m feeling lazy, Kevin.  Is the solo variant for Paperback official or fan made?   Not that it makes much of a difference if it&#039;s good, I guess.  

And I need to look into Samurai Spirit one of these days.

Re: Paperback

So I&#039;m watching part of a video playthrough focusing on the co-op game.  Looks neat.  But do you have to play a minimum of two hands as a solitaire gamer?  Would you be able to just play a single hand?  Maybe that would make it a bit easier as you can build up a single deck faster than two, but you can adjust the difficulty via the number of cubes as a penalty.

Just wondering.

Well, I&#039;m glad to see they are keeping that a secret.  At least, I didn&#039;t see it listed on the BGG page, the official website, or in the rulebook.  :whistle:

After watching the video, it seems like this game could really bog down with higher player counts...just take waiting around while players figure out words to play.  

I might be going for it.  I could use a cool solo word game.  :)

It is my favorite word game, a great light solo game, and tough! It&#039;s also a pretty good deck builder, though thinning your deck is a bit of a problem. I sort of understand why there&#039;s not too much deck thinners, since if you could thin your deck to a few cards you&#039;d just make the same word over and over. An unusual design in a way.

	<body>Like many others, I got my Kickstarter version in the mail this week and finally found some time tonight to get out the rules and give it a go.

I played two games, but the first one shouldn&#039;t count.  I was making way too many rules mistakes.  For the second game, I was the Cleric and Druid.  I just never could seem to be in the right place at the right time.  Desert fell first, then the Ocean and the Plains.  I did make it to see the Epic Foe (Dragon), but only got one hit on him before the capital city fell.  

:thumbsup: Huge replay value thanks to the variety of characters to choose from and enemies to encounter.  Like TEK, I&#039;m sure this game will feel fresh for a long time.
:thumbsup: Challenging solo play with a lot of tough decision-making moments.
:thumbsup: Great variety in both scaling and in difficulty.
:thumbsdown: Not a great rulebook, took a lot of stumbling to figure out how to play the first time through.
:thumbsdown: Slightly confusing location layout in how you can/cannot move to the capital city.

I definitely need a few more plays in before I have a solid opinion on this game, but so far so good.  Glad I backed it, and I think it will get to the table often, both solo and 2P.

Anymore, with a hobby game, I try to find a play-through video before reading the rules, and then consult the rulebook. I find it helpful to see the game as a whole before diving into the rule details.

He has gotten some static on this list earlier this month, but Rahdo Runs Through is a good one (though I think Richard is a bit of a spatz). Wil Wheaton&#039;s Tabletop is pretty good too, though they aren&#039;t as numerous as Rahdo.

And, before you say it -- I can&#039;t stand the Dice Tower reviews. They don&#039;t have enough meat or details on them, imho.

I almost *always* watch a Rahdo (or Watch It Played) video before trying to play a game for the first time.  Yeah, he&#039;s kinda crazy but his thinking-out-loud play style actually helps me understand the game better.  However, when I went to watch his video for this game, he said that he was playing with an early prototype and many of the rules would be different in the final version.

Hello fellow backer! :cool:

[q=&quot;suzyvitale&quot;]Not a great rulebook, took a lot of stumbling to figure out how to play the first time through.[/q]
Our first game, we got creamed, and then realized we made a huge mistake - we had all 9 cards in the enemy turn deck.  Yeah, every round, we took massive damage.  Though I can&#039;t blame that on the rulebook, just in my reading of it.

Once we got that figured out, medium became too easy, so I guess we&#039;re moving up to hard!  

The basilisk was the toughest thorn in our side so far.  He somehow knew when we couldn&#039;t defend to come out early so as to mess with us the whole round!

I watched Rahdo with Tiny Epic Galaxies (which just finished it&#039;s KS) and he had the same disclaimer. But I feel that they aren&#039;t going to change the rules dramatically -- mostly just tweaks. Richard would at least give me a feel for the the game.

Actually my favorite part is also it&#039;s most annoying -- when he &quot;runs through&quot; what he could do. It&#039;s a bit hard to follow because he talks so fast but he&#039;s giving you what strategies to use -- and why. That gives me the best feel for the game.

I do need to watch his video for TED because I&#039;m thinking about getting it on retail.

Same here as far as watching playthroughs. I don&#039;t care about the person&#039;s final thoughts, I just want to see it played for myself and then supplement with reading through user comments and possibly the rules. I have a large number of geekbuds who correlate well (or don&#039;t and give me the ability to triangulate) and always use the &quot;analyze&quot; feature to see what they think. Proper &quot;reviews&quot; have greatly diminished in their use and importance.

	<body>Picked this up last week and played about 4 or 5 games, making it through the first 2 maps.  

This is the only solo game I&#039;ve played more than three times not called [thing=96848]Mage Knight[/thing], so i must like it!  My son also played solo, which is rare for him - his only other one was [thing=94362][/thing].

:thumbsup: = the very small footprint, even smaller than [thing=155708][/thing], which i just got this week.
:thumbsup: = each map feels like a quest.  Makes you want to complete one map before going on to the next, even though there&#039;s no connection.
:thumbsdown: = setup is kind of fiddly, with all the card finding and separation.  Not terrible, but enough that I keep the cards for the map I&#039;m currently working on separate, so I can only be working on one map at a time, which is fine (see previous :thumbsup:).
:?block: will the map progression be interesting enough to keep it interesting, or will it start to feel samey?  At its low price point and commitment requirement, it will have been worth picking up even if it provides only 10 or so plays.

Comparing this to 2 other games really popular solo games that I didn&#039;t like:

[thing=71721]Space Hulk: Death Angel[/thing] - in DDD, you build up your troops, acquire special soldiers, acquire more tools.  The opposition will wear you down eventually, but you still feel as if you are getting more powerful.  In SHDA, you start at full power, and the game beats you down; it&#039;s a one way ticket to hell.  I guess i like the feeling of playing DDD&#039;s game arc better, even though I like SHDA&#039;s theme more.  

[thing=121921]Robinson Crusoe[/thing] - Both games are scenario-based puzzles and rely heavily on dice.  DDD feels lightweight and nimble, and let&#039;s you play in 20 mins.  RC has tons more setup and rules and fiddliness and time involvement, but i didn&#039;t feel that it gave more game, and possibly even fewer decisions to make.  It is oozing with theme though.  I&#039;ve still got theme stuck to my rug, even though I sold the game months ago :p</body>

About how long do your solo games take?

10 to 20 minutes. At most. It&#039;s a quick playing game.

Chris&#039;s estimate is about right, though i tend to be on the longer end of that.

I do!  It seems to be a dice chucking puzzle which sounds practically perfect, and a perfect time length for weeknight gaming.  It will be here on Wednesday, can&#039;t wait!

	<body>I don&#039;t quite get this game, but I haven&#039;t yet given it a fair shake yet either. Nonetheless, my Spidey sense is tingling with &quot;This game isn&#039;t for you; let it go.&quot; I&#039;m going to have to wait another month before I can get a proper play.

Let me back up first. I had played a ftf learning game with a friend who got a thank you copy for proofreading (NOT on this game as he was sure to point out; these rules suck big time). He lent it to me afterwards as he has no interest in wargames of any type. Tonight I figured I&#039;d muck around and play a scenario or two, you know, just play both sides. I was unsure how I felt about the game after my ftf play as I was expecting something different, and I&#039;ve been curious to revisit. More on that in a bit. 

First off, I discovered my friend had gotten some things wrong, including giving me the wrong units to play the first scenario with, heh. No worries, I figured I&#039;d just read the rules and figure it out. Ugh. After struggling with the rules I was incorrectly taught, the rulebook, and consulting BGG, the light went on and I was able to get started. 

Well, while some wargames lend themselves to playing both sides as best you can, I don&#039;t think this is one of them. And I do realize there is a solo variant posted but I didn&#039;t want to learn the base game AND a variant at the same time. Trying to plan the sequence of orders for each side against myself was not interesting or fun for me in any way. I finally decided to randomize the orders for one side and try to play the other side intelligently. I got through the first scenario OK, as in &quot;just OK but I didn&#039;t get a sense of the fun&quot;, and decided to try the 2nd scenario to see if things got more interesting. 

They didn&#039;t, and I finally stopped the play 3/4 of the way through because I realized this is just not a good candidate for solitaire play and I may be predisposed against the game to boot. Something about the game seems discordant. On one hand, whereas I was expecting a &quot;fun, light, WWII movie-esque game&quot;, from the first impression I&#039;d gleaned, I found myself locked up in AP with the programming. I think the ostensible fun of the game is programming some of your units in order and hoping the sequence actually works out. For me, it was annoying and not fun when the sequence didn&#039;t pay off. I find playing [thing=24800][/thing] a lighter experience than this one. 

OK, so my impression of what the game is was off, but then (and here&#039;s the discordance), the cards introduce some really, and I mean really, random elements. So the experience of the game for me is, Have a hard time envisioning the order of units I should activate, agonize over it, finally commit, and then have very little if any of it matter anyway. Repeat. And I get the whole &quot;... until contact with the enemy&quot; concept of making a wargame, but from a player&#039;s standpoint, it wasn&#039;t tripping the fun wire for me. 

Wow, that was longer than I expected, but it feels good to work my thoughts out. I have a friend I normally play CoH with who wants to try it with me next month, so I may do that, but I packed it up and put it back tonight. Not gonna force it. Guess I&#039;m kinda bummed because I was set to spend my evening and tomorrow playing around with it.

:thumbsup: Um, I have a free copy to try

:thumbsdown: Not a good solitaire candidate IMO

:thumbsdown: I doubt the fun the game offers is the type I like

Love this game for solitaire play.  I&#039;ve bought a ton of the extra units too as they come available and as February is becoming Wargame Month for me, I expect to get it out again.

How I&#039;ve handled the solo play with the unit orders is quite simple.  I made numbered chits for each unit (1-15 or so for each side, grey and white).  One number goes on or next to each unit on the board.  

Then for the number of orders I&#039;m to receive, let&#039;s say 3, I put into a cup or bag the number for three units I want to move and one more (so 4 in this example).  Do that for both sides.  Then you draw up to the number allowed (3 in this case).  So it mixes up what order they resolve in AND even you don&#039;t know which three of the four you are going to actually get to use.  

As for the cards, since they are pretty much just special abilities, playing them as you see fit is just fine.

You just have to remember that when you&#039;re playing the Germans, you&#039;re German and when the Allies, you&#039;re allied.  Do what works best for the turn your own.

Works like a champ.

I  don&#039;t have any solo opinion on that game. I played it a couple of times with a friend, no more. But I loved to read your post, Kurt, found it nicely written.

I enjoyed that part a lot:

You put, in few and well chosen words, the feelings I&#039;ve had with too many games.... :D

[i]PS: the sophisticated chits suggestion by Kevin looks good to me. Maybe I should borrow the game from my friend and give it a solo try...[/i]

For those trying this I should add that all units that don&#039;t get orders still get their move only activations per the regular rules. 

I also did separate draw cups for each side but you could easily use one to really mix it up.

Not my favourite for solo play, but it can be done if you don&#039;t use hidden units.

Love the component quality, especially the template system and the armoured units.

Probably the best sandbox game I&#039;ve ever come across because of the template system.

	<body>Just picked this up today, and needed to learn the rules so I set up for a 1 player Tutorial game and hit the ground running.
[imageid=2406956 large]
Unfortunately, it hit back. The missions went fine, but I took a big hit to the base and ended up bumping all the terror levels by 1. Couldn&#039;t get a whole lot researched early, and the worst part was the UFOs [u]EVERYWHERE[/u]! I ran out of Interceptors and by the time the final mission came up everyone panicked.

	<body>My first attempt at the [article=18260586]challenge[/article] is a 17.6. Mostly got what I wanted, which was nice, but still just fell short. Respectable, but nowhere near the leader (19.16!!!!!!)

Edit (2/8/15): So, I&#039;m not sure what to do with this. I scored 20.0! however, I forgot to draw a field card along the way, so I drew my last field card with the last harvest. Things certainly went well, I was able to be satisfying the cabbage/leek customer on round 2. I had fields when I needed them and was able to keep them stocked. I 2 packed every round. I feel like if I missed that card I might have missed somewhere else, but I felt I was being very diligent about going through each phase in order (sometimes I get ahead of myself). It blows me away though! It&#039;s hard to believe it.  </body>

I find that after I harvest and turn over the next field, I often jump right over the card phase and start satisfying customers. Can&#039;t count the number of times I have had to backtrack to the card phase :p

That&#039;s exactly what I do. I had to force myself to focus on the cards and then get into the more free-form action phase.

I put this all together when I first got the game.  It allowed me to pack it up and move it out of reach of little hands and cats while in the middle of a game.  Now it&#039;s just convenient to keep it setup this way.

Btw - that pad on the right of the board is a Target kitchen mat I picked up for $20.  Basically a 20&quot;x 40&quot; mousepad I started using for gaming.

	<body>Second play of this one. Again, I just used the base game components, picking most of the heroes I hadn&#039;t tried last time: Knight, Priest, Acolyte and Wizard. I&#039;m more and more impressed how different each hero seems from the others. I&#039;m also impressed by how the game avoids cliche. For example, the Knight&#039;s abilities, especially [-]his[/-][b]her[/b] Oaths (another unusual thing, of course, is the knight&#039;s gender), are very thematic while at the same time being unlike anything else I&#039;ve seen associated with a Knight character in a game, while the Acolyte character is all-around unique (but also very thematic).

I had a lot more killing power this time. Unfortunately, none of my characters were any good at searching, and this was compounded by a lot of lousy rolls and a few poor choices. I also started the Darkness track at 5 this time (since I won the previous game, I figured I should increase the difficulty). All together, that led to a drawn-out loss. I [i]nearly[/i] turned it around at the last moment after the Priest died and was replaced by the Rogue, who is great at searching, but the same round the Rogue dug up the last key, allowing the Knight to unlock a Relic, the Darkness track spawned a fifth blight in the Monastery and we were all doomed. :(

Spent a lot of this game hiding out in the monastery. In many games, that might be un-fun, but this one does it so thematically, I ended up enjoying myself anyway. Enjoyed it more when I won, of course. :D

I&#039;m not sure if I should mix in the expansion stuff yet or not. I&#039;m still barely getting my bearings with the base set heroes, but I am feeling a lack of variety in the blights being spawned (near the end of the game, I had to do a lot of redraws when the Map cards called for a blight that was all out of stock). I may just mix in the new Map cards from Shifting Winds and maybe play around with some new characters, but not necessarily take on Quests yet.

Last game, I had a lot of trouble finding space for my heroes as they powered up, so I tried a new table setup this time that worked much better:

I don&#039;t think you need to fuss with quests for a few games; they work to mix up the routine (for people who claim to have broken the game, in particular). I agree, it can be a table-hog once your characters begin to develop. I eventually settled on this:

I actually start to stack cards on top of each other, since the illustrations don&#039;t do much for me. The top card just covers the illustration of the bottom card, leaving the rest of the bottom card and text visible.

The board itself is not that large. I think you could condense it quite a bit if you kept the heroes&#039; powers in a &quot;hand&quot; instead of spread out, as I am attempting to do. Of course, that means you&#039;d spend more time picking up the hand of powers and reading through them.

Jason, that&#039;s pretty close to the original setup I tried. Didn&#039;t work for me, unfortunately--I kept having to push the board further and further left. You seem to have a nice long table, though.

	<body>Yup, again. Can&#039;t seem to get this one off the table, this weekend. (As a sidebar, I&#039;m rather enjoying my new philosophy of not bringing bloody work home on a Friday - and I sure can&#039;t remember a single time in all these years anyone thanked me for such.)

Simple set-up, basic decks - with a couple of promo adventurers thrown into the mix, for the first time: the Barbarian Beserker and the Ice Dwarf Explorer (figured I could make use of a couple of extra health points). I haven&#039;t used any of the new dungeon promos yet, but I rather like the new tricks they bring. 

Anyway... the dungeon was up to its old tricks, this morning. I met a card that I couldn&#039;t get around (a troll, giving me terrible memories of similar issues with the Lord of the Rings LCG). The bugger is immune to regular melee damage... unfortunately, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I pulled a couple of swords out of the bag, but spent ages getting slapped around until I grabbed a magical damage dagger. (Yeah, he wasn&#039;t immune to that.) Greenknee, once again, made an early visit to the dungeon, but I seem to be getting better at handling him. Got close to the Stars are Aligned quest, but I think it&#039;s just too random, unless you have rare cards which allow for dungeon deck manipulation, and I might swap a different quest in, next time. 

Sheer weight of numbers wore me down, I suffered a couple of drain effects - which toss the top card of your deck to the discard pile. Lost a useful bag of supplies which would have restocked my hand, and a fire spell, which I could have happily used five or six times. As ever, unable to find the Damsel to rescue, my poor, wounded, Gypsy Stormcatcher was left alone in the dark. Until she realised those strange sounds weren&#039;t her imagination... and she ended up blundering into a dart trap. Whilst poisoned. 

Which is thorough, you have to admit. 

[imageid=2407256large]
An unusually good opening hand. Plenty of defence. Which you will need. 

[imageid=2407257large]
Greenknee and the troll (which sounds like an excellent title for a 70&#039;s cop show). A glance at the Necromancer&#039;s cards shows a stamina (health) of two and an attack power of three. His attack is augmented by a ranged three magic attack (he gets plus three power against adventurers without the &quot;ranged&quot; keyword, &quot;magic&quot; is the damage type); he is a unique character, which means he allows the completion of the Evil Has a Name quest; he adds one extra point to encounters (add the numbers in the top left of the card, usual limit is five); he is a Reaver - which means he can kill a low level monster to regenerate a life point; he summons bastards to help him, once he arrives; stealth means you can&#039;t attack him until every other villain character is dead.

I promise, this all becomes really intuitive after a few plays. The rule book glossary is great at explaining and referencing it all. (It was just the basic mechanisms that were initially woolly.)</body>

It&#039;s a lot more thematic and I thought. It&#039;s an interesting game, that&#039;s for sure, but it&#039;s a bit hard to get. There are a ton of keywords (four pages worth printed out and font size 9, with the chaff cut out), but not all of them show up in the starter set. 

The expansions are expensive, and printed differently, so it&#039;s very obvious which cards are expansion  (different card stock, and very different shades of colors), but I think they add a decent chunk to the game. Well, I haven&#039;t played with them much, so that&#039;s just a guess.

I agree that after a game or two it makes sense. But the game first few can be painful. The rulebook is structured for someone who already knows how to play the game, and doesn&#039;t give adequate info on some things. Like, area damage, or some of the interactions of abilities (one of the slimes cost me a headache when I first played). 

Thankfully, the designer has posted an absolutely fantastic flash tutorials that teach the game. And he&#039;s great about responding to questions on the geek page.

Those files Gary did were great (who?) too. Though I reformatted them to get rid of the yellow background. 

It&#039;s sort of like Race for the Galaxy. It&#039;s a bit hard to understand all the keywords (or icons) at first. But once you get them, they make perfect thematic sense.

	<body>Played a solo game of this against 5 Civ-Bots (2 medium, 3 easy). Used two variants which I hoped would add some spice to the game:

I) Advanced rule of choosing your advisor when allowed to draw a new one, instead of drawing randomly.
II) playing with the events deck

I will definately stick to I) in all future games (solo or multiplayer) as it adds more control. 

The events are quite harsh at times, even though you can see them one round in advance. Makes fun in the solo game, where I will keep them. Not sure, if they do the multiplayer game any good. Rather fear the opposite.

Got my butt kicked by one of the noble Civ-Bots. We had the world under our control at game&#039;s end with him being roughly 50 points ahead of me. The mid 2nd era was crucial as he was already up to highest military due to combination of events and always drawing both advance military cards. Thus not the slightest chance for me to get in his range and I could only hope for the other bots to slightly sting to him. They did, but were wiped out eventually and my mixed tactics saw me falling short.

:thumbsup: Still a challenging solo Civ-like game which holds enough challenges for me. 
:thumbsdown: The character of the solo game is quite different from multiplayer, especially as the leaders (scoring you VP at end of each era and thus providing you with additional strategic direction) are not in play. 
:thumbsdown: the rulebook is a pain in the butt. Searching specific rules is not an easy task. In addition, there are quite some loopholes in the rules, especially when it comes to events and to Civ-Bots. </body>

	<body>Another solo game with my playing both hands while I waited for Darkwynd to post his solo rules for the CapAp version of the cards (that version is now posted!).

The Aliens got off to a slow albeit steady start.  They were never able to massacre the marines but were able to kill off at least 1 marine per round.  This meant that, relative to the movie, they were slightly behind (Apone didn&#039;t die until the marines were escaping by way of APC).

However, in the mid-game, the Alien player managed to pull off another dropship disaster which helped to thin down the marines.  The murder of Ferro lead to an additional 2 rounds in the Dropship Evac stage which gave the Aliens a chance to recover and get some kills.  Particularly helpful was the lack of operations cards during the same period.

Moving into the final stage on the Sulaco and things were pretty tight.  The marines still had Ripley, Bishop and Newt.  By now, the Alien player was starting to feel pretty good albeit the marines did have a pretty decent handsize as the marines were unable to play many operations cards during Dropship Evac.

These cards were promptly discarded to power the Sentry Gun!  Woohoo!

However, the joy was shortlived as the Aliens threw down an Alien Swarm and managed to kill off poor little Newt.  Advantage to the Aliens!

However (again!), a lucky draw in the second round of the Sulaco (after poor little Newt got eaten by a passing Alien) allowed the marine player to field the Powerloader.  Together with the Sentry Gun and other ops cards, the marines now had 13 power on the Sulaco stage!  Firepower FTW!

The last couple of rounds were brutal as, in desperation, the Alien player threw everything he had at the marines.  Two security doors dropped to delay the marines final escape - pushing back the turn marker back twice in the final rounds.  However, this would only delay the inevitable if they couldn&#039;t pull any Alien cards to overwhelm the marines firepower.  With the lack of marine kills, the Nuke counter was also ticking perilously close to zero!

Aliens kept coming at the marines in waves.  Some were devastated by careful controlled bursts by the marines.  Others were blown apart with grenades.  Despite this, the Aliens kept coming - knowing it was their last chance to take out the last surviving marines before their timely escape.

Ultimately, despite Bishop being torn in half, the marines were able to keep the Aliens at bay and scrape out the win.  It was a close call but, in the end, the combined firepower of the Powerloader and Sentry Gun proved too much for the Aliens to deal with.

Hoo-ah!

:thumbsup: What an intense way to end the game!  When the Powerloader dropped, it looked like it was all over for the Aliens.  However, the two security doors kept the game going (1 more round!) and, in addition to giving the Alien a chance to get back in the game, had me starting to worry that the marines were fated to lose!
:thumbsdown: Still waiting for the CapAp version of the solo variant (Its up now!)
:thumbsdown: I now play the Dropship Evac stage with the Ferro side up by default.  So far, I have never had a game where Ferro died after the Dropship Evac stage!

[size=18][b]Origin story[/b][/size]
My origin story is fairly simple and started last month.  I found this geeklist while looking at Lord of the Rings LCG and considering whether to buy or not.  Somehow, from there, I managed to find my way to this geeklist which blew my mind.  How could I not have known about this before!

I quickly posted my solo plays of Aliens: TTiW and found an amazingly welcome community of like minded gamers.  Which is also the reason I keep coming back (well, that and the fact that I play games solo :))

As to how much money this list has cost me?  So far - none.  But this question scares the heck out of me!</body>

Are you sure you want to do that? 

When I came back from seeing Alien at the cinema when it first came out  I was living by myself in my own flat and I was spooked all night long. The light switch in the hall was by the front door, so I kept it on all evening as I didn&#039;t want to have to go into the hall while it was in darkness! :D

	<body>The fourth week of the Monthly Sentinels challenge!  Here were the rules:

Week 4: We&#039;re all citizens here

Villain: Citizen Dawn

Environment: Ruins of Atlantis

Heroes:

Everyone MUST use AZ. The random hero is: 1d10 = 9

Reroll: 1d10 = 4&#039;

Wraith

rounds+wounds+1 for each HP that Citizen Dawn (and only Citizen Dawn) heals. 

EG, if the healing light card is played and she would heal 10 damage but only has 5 HP to heal, you add +5 and not +10.


And here are my results:

I went with Legacy, as I know he&#039;s a great match with Wraith, and I wanted some potential for team healing.  It nearly worked, but ultimately wasn&#039;t enough.

I knew this was going to be tough, but wow did I get pounded!  Once Citizen Dawn flipped, a pair of Krakens kept picking off the citizens, which kept her flipped!

[b]Time:[/b] 17 turns
[b]Legacy:[/b] 32 wounds and K.O.&#039;d
[b]Wraith:[/b] 26 wounds and K.O.&#039;d
[b]Absolute Zero:[/b] 29 wounds and K.O.&#039;d
[b]Healing to Citizen Dawn:[/b] 31

[b]Total:[/b] 135 and a loss!

Ugh.  Dawn&#039;s card sweeper came out late in the game, which would have been great, if I could have beat her before then.  Worse, Citizen Tears came out right after Dawn scrubbed everyone&#039;s ongoings, and after that, it was just a matter of waiting for the beat down to end.  Still, it&#039;s losses like this that make the victories all the sweeter!</body>

	<body>After changing job last week, alongside all the bumf that goes with finishing my last job, this afternoon has been my first solo session of the month, a lovely relaxing intro game of Loyang to ease me into the rules. It seems to travel along at a nice clip once you have the rules down and probably only took 45 minutes or so - although perhaps I ought to have spent a little longer think looking back on my ignominious score of 14. Still, it seems to be one of those games where you realise stupid things as soon as you&#039;ve done them so I know a few little tricks for next game that&#039;ll hopefully bump the score up somewhat.

:thumbsup: Quick, brainburny goodness as you might expect from Uwe (I seem to remember saying almost the same thing about Glass Road actually, but this felt a lot more satisfying for some reason)
:thumbsdown: Putting all the veg on those little cards is an absolute faff, especially for my sausage fingers
:thumbsdown: Tempted me away from painting the bathroom which is what I was supposed to be doing this afternoon</body>

You know, sometimes for your mental health, you need to do some gaming even if more &quot;responsible&quot; tasks need to be done. &quot;Phooey&quot;, I say, &quot;to what it looks like to the outside observer. Phooey!&quot;

yes i&#039;m supposed to be rewiring my fire alarms today.  But Sunday is a great day to play board games with the family so..  :whistle:.

EDIT: well, kids got onto video games, so I had a couple hours, and i did re-wire all 7 of them.  But not by choice!

	<body>[b]Origin Story[/b]:
So everyday for about two years I drove past two FLGS, always curious, but never stopping in. One I knew was a Miniatures type store, which wasn&#039;t my thing, but last year that at the behest of my wife we stopped in at the other one.
After purchasing Dominion, I had the bug, and went back up looking for something to play solo. After a whole lot of help from the staff, I picked up Pathfinder. I really dug playing solo, and after I found out some of my co-workers played games, I got pointed in the direction of BGG, and checking it out I stumbled across this forum. At that point, I joined, and never looked back. Great club to be a part of, although my wallet may disagree;)

That being said, I played this beast today, starting with scenario number 1, and boy did I get hammered. That being said I did kill a lot of undead, and had a blast doing so! </body>

This is definitely one of those games that I have as much fun losing as I do winning! Just picked up the Uncle Honk hero box, hoping to play a little clown vs zombies this afternoon.

Yes, scenario 1 is one of the hardest IMO.  I think #10 was the one I got my first success.  Y Zone was a good introduction but on the easy side, even after they changed the win condition.

	<body>Played &quot;Might is Right&quot; where the goal is to find three survivors in hiding and get off the map. Used the &quot;Romero mode&quot; which uses spawn cards 43 to 54 and only spawns regular walkers, no berserkers, runners or fatties. Just rewatched Dawn of the Dead, so wanted to go old school!

==================================

So a priest and a clown walk into a zombie apocalypse:

[imageid=2407761 medium]

Padre Johnson armed with a pistol and Uncle Honk with a claw hammer, they head into the first building:

[imageid=2407762 medium]

In the building they find a shotgun for Padre Johnson, another clawhammer for Uncle Honk and the first survivor, Bones:

[imageid=2407763 medium]

Scouring the building, they find a riot shield and a sword for Bones, then head out into the street:

[imageid=2407765 medium]

Inch by inch they work their way forward, Uncle Honk swinging wildly with his pair of claw hammers and Padre Johnson blasting away with his shotgun:

[imageid=2407766 medium]

As Padre Johnson stays in the intersection, keeping things clear with his shotgun, Bones and Uncle Honk work their way to the door of the next building:

[imageid=2407767 medium]

Uncle Honk pries open the door with his hammer and finds another survivor, Belle, plus a matching sword for Bones and a sword for Belle:

[imageid=2407773 medium]

Rejoining Padre Johnson in the intersection, the survivors work their way to the second last building, hoping to find the last survivor there. The noise they are making is drawing more and more walkers:

[imageid=2407776 medium]

Belle and Padre Johnson remain in the street, hoping to keep an escape route open. Uncle Honk and Bones fight their way into the heavily infested building and Bones finds a dog that has been hiding out from the zombies:

[imageid=2407779 medium]

With their two swords and two claw hammers, and some help from their new canine friend, Uncle Honk and Bones clear the building of zombies in a bloody battle. Bones&#039; riot shield the only thing preventing him from becoming zombie chow.  As the battle ends, the last missing survivor, Joshua, emerges from hiding. A quick search uncovers a hatchet he can use to fight his way out, and Bones gives him his riot shield:

[imageid=2407783 medium]

Now it is a mad dash to the exit before the ever growing horde makes escape impossible:

[imageid=2407784 medium]

Padre Johnson continues to blast away with his shotgun as the other survivors make a break for the exit:

[imageid=2407785 medium]

As Uncle Honk gets held up by a swarm of zombies, the rest of the survivors wait for him:

[imageid=2407787 medium]

Dispatching enough zombies to make a break for it, Uncle Honk makes a final run for the exit:

[imageid=2407789 medium]

With everyone alive, it is time to head back to their boarded up safe house and celebrate this rare victory!

I have been on a binge of zombicide this week (coupled with a complete Romero zombie film-fest - my girlfriend hasn&#039;t seen any of them). Love the simple rule set combined with tough to beat missions. Have started seriously considering picking up the [thing=137987]Toxic City Mall[/thing] expansion for added variety. Though I may just wait for the [thing=161866]Rue Morgue[/thing] season to hit stores. Decisions, decisions!

I [i]almost[/i] picked up Toxic City Mall this weekend, but decided to wait, as I am just starting to explore the base game. The simple rules are what I love too. It&#039;s just a fun, thematic game.

I started with Prison Outbreak (skipped season one), but ended up buying the map tile set for season one so I could play those missions. I like the option of variety with the berserker zombies (must be killed in melee, not affected by ranged attacks). I have played this a ton, so I am starting to feel ready for something new. Just have to decide whether I prefer toxic zombies (will damage survivors in the same zone if killed in melee) from Toxic Mall vs. the skinner/crawler (if you roll ones while killing a skinner, will spawn a crawler) from Rue Morgue. The one thing that is tilting me towards Rue Morgue is the inclusion of 12 survivors (and the helicopter).

	<body>First play, finally! And a lot of re-reading.

[ImageID=2407744]

Set up took me quite a while but I guess this will be faster next time. It took me some time to find out what marker is what ship and which ones are not recommened for the first few plays. After I sorted out what I need for this learning game I had the map ready pretty fast.

I played the Deathmachine Solo mission. The small one.

My Scouts were racing through the galaxy and exploring as much as possible. Lucky as I was I had two planets right next to my home system. And my first question came up. Can I transport Ship Yards? You start the game with four in your HS and I was asking myself if I can transport one or two with a ship to a planet I colonized. Guess not. I only found that you can build them on planets but nothing of transporting them. I know, I know... how do you want to transport a Ship yard? :what: Hey it&#039;s Sci-Fi, right? Nothing is impossible! If I can shot my PDS in [thing=12493][/thing] into a system next to the system where the PDS is stationed, why not transport a SY? I mean how crazy is that? Shot a cannon on a planet into a system next to it&#039;s own and even score a hit! :D

Anyway...

[ImageID=2407745]

I lost 2 of my Scouts because of a Danger! marker. But I did not waste any rescourses on new ones because the first DM was about to enter the game.

I used my resources to get technologies and to build ships. I build my first Destroyer which I used to explore. The DM then entered in the same area as my DD and was a real killing machine. My DD was out in no time. I have to mention that I played the EASY mode. :p

[ImageID=2407746]

Ok, I am sure I played some things wrong and the DM was faster at my HS than I thought. My two new build Cruisers managed to score 1 hit on the DM but that beast also took them out with the first attack. The dice hate me! I rolled fantastic on the DM rolls and totally failed on my own.

First impression.
:thumbsup: I like the idea that you always play with a fog of war kind of thing. Always a galaxy to explore, always new. Just what I love!
:thumbsup: The more I play games with markers instead of minis, the more I prefer marker over minis. The strategic point in a multiplayer game is unbeatable if you compare minis and markers. I really like the idea of not knowing what your opponents might have under their markers, like they handle it here in [thing=84419][/thing]. Ok not of interest in a pure solo game.
:thumbsup: The Tech sheet is fantastic! I wish TI3 had something like this.
:thumbsup: A rulebook so short but a game that has such a depth. A great example for others!
:thumbsdown: I lost my first game. :D :p No really, I couldn&#039;t find anything so far that was really bad.</body>

Welcome to the fandom of counters over stupid plastic minis. Counters are the best. They can have info printed on them and no on cards. They don&#039;t need to be painted (just clipped), and you can fit a ton more on a small space. 

They just don&#039;t look as fancy. But they sure are a better system for most games.

Not let me get back to painting minis... :whistle:

Seriously, though, I do vastly prefer counters to minis in 99% of games, and get annoyed when they try to shoehorn minis into games that don&#039;t need them.

Yay for minis and boo for counters... And yay for either of them over blocks :D

But in fairness, it depends upon the game in question.

In the commands and colours system, the minis of M44 and Battlelore first edition defifinitely hit the sweet spot after painting (not so keen on them unpainted, but still better than blocks).

Can&#039;t imagine playing Descent (strictly first edition), Shadows of Brimstone or Mansions of Madness without minis.

On the other hand I can&#039;t imagine playing GMT CDG&#039;s without counters.

So it&#039;s horses for courses.

I prefer the CnC blocks over the minis. But I really like the clean lines. 

I agree that Shadows of Brimstone would lose a lot without the minis, though it&#039;d be better with better quality minis... 

Overall, though, I prefer compact and informational over hunks of gawdy plastic.

I generally agree with this, though I feel compelled to report a recent case where I went against my own policy. I&#039;ve been looking at [thing=143096][/thing] and plan to get a copy. I missed out on the KS, but there&#039;s some talk that you can email the designer via KS and still get in on a preorder, so I did. There were several expansions offered as add-ons in the KS campaign, and one was for miniatures. Looking at the campy nature of the game and the minis, I felt like I preferred the cardboard standups to go along with the cheesiness of it. The minis felt oddly out of place, too realistic or something, so I didn&#039;t order them.

And full disclosure, I&#039;ve not yet heard back from anyone so I can&#039;t confirm as of yet that the game is indeed orderable (b/c I know you ALL will want this if you go check it out). :D

I thought the same thing until I played Machina Arcana - and the black and white standups are perfect.  I&#039;m leaning more and more towards counters, and less towards minis; but I think that&#039;s also showing a change in my gaming tastes as well.

[b][i]Game 2[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #12  (When I lost Eowyn and 3 allies on a single The Necromancer&#039;s Reach)
[b][i]Game 3[/i][/b] (with shadow card): [color=purple][b]Fail[/b][/color] ; cause I forgot the ability of Banks of the Anduin.
[b][i]Game 4[/i][/b] (with shadow card): [color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] turn #16 ; 150+35+4-10=179 (I had never seen any Sneak Attack, so I had to delay the fight against the Troll till I had enough allies)
[b][i]Game 5[/i][/b] (with shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #7  (Or when the encounter deck doesn&#039;t stop throwing horrible things to you)

[b]The Deck[/b]
[u]Heroes:[/u] Theodred - Dunhere - Eowyn
[u]Allies:[/u] Faramir - Longbeard Orc Slayer - Northern Guide - Wandering Took - Beorn
[u]Attachments:[/u] Unexpected Courage
[u]Events:[/u] Ever Vigilant - Sneak Attack - The Galadhrim&#039;s Greeting - A Test of Will

[b]Verdict[/b]
That doesn&#039;t work as expected. But, strangely, I think I did mulligan on each game. I don&#039;t really see how I can improve it right now. A Test of Will is perhaps not that important against this quest. Power in the Earth could be more interesting in fact. Or at least it would be useful for me on game #5.

	<body>I am trying to avoid spending too much time writing for the SGoYT lists as it could be time better spent playing games.
However I will occassionally add an entry for a less popular game such as this one.

There is a simple solo variant included in the rulebook, however it really does limit gameplay and doesn&#039;t provide the complexity of the full game.
The designers did submit a Co-op variant, which works very well as a solo if you do not mind playing with three ships. 
The Goal is to survive, although I like to add the extra &quot;super win condition&quot; of actually destroying the end Boss. :devil:
I have played this a few times before, so I did have a strategy and was aware of the &quot;gotchas&quot; in game play (Like things you forget or lose track of!) :)

The first bonus was having spaces for all the ships to enter play.
[ImageID=2407757 medium]

I then made sure I tracked all the Bellonium both from defeating enemies and the occassional Global acquisition. (It is something I missed often last game).

The other objective is to keep ahead of the Nemesis Cube by earning Glory and preventing enemies from exiting the board. This proved to be a lot easier in this game than in previous sessions.

A lot of energy was wasted using the rotary cage to target enemies, so the first upgrade for all ships was to give omni-directional firing. This was quickly followed by Generators and Weapons. Captain Hawk (Yellow) and Captain Bomber (Grey) both took the short range level 1 flamer while Captain Warlock (Red) took a level two laser to get rid of those stronger enemies.

With good coordination and the death of many enemies, shields, upgraded generators and more powerful weapons, meant we were ready for the final Boss.
[ImageID=2407756 medium]   

The generators were essential to the strategy as there were only two turns to wreak damage because of the short range flamers.
Unknown to me, one Boss segment was immune to Laser damage, so the final ship formation was also exceedingly lucky.

We all managed to survive but I just couldn&#039;t get enough firepower together to destroy the Boss (Although there wasn&#039;t much left!!!)
Even a suicide attempt (I did have an extra life available) would not deal enough damage.
As it is Captain Warlock barely survived the Broadside on the final row.
[ImageID=2407755 medium]
Well, Maybe better luck next time.

:thumbsup: An exciting puzzle type game where the luck is reduced to card draws.
:thumbsup: Plenty of variety in enemies, upgrades and other effects. You are never bored.
:thumbsdown: Lack of a true solo game.
:thumbsdown: A large investment of time (Although you don&#039;t actually notice that when you are playing).

[b][size=14]Origin Story[/size][/b]
I was lucky enough to have lurked right from the beginning in May 2013. I think that was because of something Albert had posted somewhere.

[i]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? [/i]
It was a subscription to a print and play game (Utopia Engine) that lead me to the SGoYT geeklist and made me subscribe 

[i]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/i]
It wasn&#039;t until July 2013 that I eventually posted my own entry of Space Hulk: Death Angel. Yes, I still own it and all the expansions. I don&#039;t play it as much now as I have so many solo games.
This game was also my first &quot;SGoYT made me buy this&quot; although that was before that geeklist even existed! :)

[i]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/i]
Probably just the amount of people who were posting. I didn&#039;t realize there were so many dedicated solo gamers.

[i]What keeps bringing you back?[/i]
Same as most people ... the solo information and opinions about various games and ... the friendly attitude about those opinions.

[i]How much money have these lists cost you?[/i]
AU$1,486.61

However, we ARE sort of at an early stage of the official coop version or expansion depending on what decisions are taken about the game.
And it is looking exciting, let me tell you that! There are just SO MANY neat ideas to play with when it comes to Kemble&#039;s coop :). Just the possibility to merge two players&#039; ships together to get a combined upgraded weapon is an awesome thing, which makes it possible to put out enemies with  6-7 energy, enemies that needs to have shields taken out the same round (think Death Star :whistle:), enemies that need to be damaged by two types of weapons during the same turn etc etc. The possibilities are endless and I need to stop ranting right now ;)

Without me having to dive into the rules, can you explain WHY?  Is there some kind of timer, or did you literally not have enough resources left to buy a big enough gun, or what?

There is a timer.
The board consists of 5 rows of cards and after each player has had their turn, the bottom row is removed and a top row is added.
The Boss consists of the last cards in the game, so when he appears you no longer add a top row to the board, so it gets smaller.
The last two photos are of the last two turns of the game.
The first photo shows the start of the 2nd last turn (2 rows without any damage yet) and the last photo shows the end of the last turn (1 row).
Flamers are short range weapons, so I should have moved the player ships up closer to the Boss earlier. That way I would have had more turns to deal damage instead of trying to do it all in the last two turns.

	<body>After easily and successfully [thread=1315325]completing the Jungle Campaign[/thread] earlier this month, I was keen to move into the Middle East for some much higher intensity firefights.

My first attempt at [b]Short &amp; Sweet / Command APC[/b] was tense and down to the wire, and I lost it due to a lack of actions (and a poor decision perhaps to not hold onto a Mortar Call), as well as some bad &#039;Event&#039; draws at both locations (Refugees and an IED). [listitem=3724385]My second attempt[/listitem] drew on lessons learnt (more bang! for those numerous groups of hostiles), and was ultimately successful, which is always a rush.

Enthused, I embarked on mission 2 of the Insurgents campaign last night ([b]Short Patrol / Chieftain[/b]). [geekurl=/plays/thing/149951?userid=659773]2 attempts, and 2 dismal failures[/geekurl]!!!! GAH! Those numerous value 1 Gunmen, with 2 reticules and Defense of 3 are a curse, especially when you are rolling poorly on the Penetration dice! 

My second attempt was a protracted firefight, that saw large numbers of suppressed hostiles in side street, on whom I squandered my explosives, but really struggled to eliminate. Eventually my men pushed through into an open field just shy of the chieftain&#039;s house, but as they started to empty magazines on the prolific number of defenders, the hostiles&#039; return fire rapidly pinned them down and overwhelmed them.

Sigh... Back to the drawing board. I think I may try two player-soldiers next, just to get more action cards (and more frags?)..... And I need to maximize my penetration bonuses for ranged attacks....

I have found I like having two player-soldiers before I add any NPS or squad-soldiers. They don&#039;t even have to be maxed out super player-soldiers either. Having two hands of cards gives me more options in how to handle the hostiles/situation. 

There is something to be said for having more actions to help handle the hostiles, but I place a higher value on two hands of cards and then actions.

Yeah, good call Waylon. I guess the Action Deck is really the implementation/manifestation of the &#039;Special Forces&#039; advanced training of your team (compared with the Hostiles). If you fall back on solely actions and firing, you will eventually get overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. The trick is to be able to buy yourself the time to gain and leverage those action cards....


I spent a very relaxing 20 minutes last night planning my next team. Two cheap player soldiers: one with ranged &#039;bang&#039; (UGL); and one with  a suppressor on a HK417 (I recall?) and attachments, plus a few frags and M2, for close range bang. Suppressor should help a lot with higher defense value hostiles in adjacent locations, rather than wasting explosives on them; it also means this soldier is effective at both range 0 &amp; 1 (unlike the much cheaper but more limiting suppressed MP7&#039;s etc). I did look longingly at the SCARS, but reloads on 3&#039;s would really hurt a 2 man team...

	<body>[size=18][b]Six nations tournament, first round
France-Scotland, Stade de France[/b][/size]

First time out with that game, I decided to play a 2x20 turn game since it seems that a turn lasts about 2 minutes.

[b]Kick off
[/b]Scotland aims for an early gain on their left flank, hoping to outrun the French. It is however a mess and France gather the ball.

[b]10th minute[/b]
[imageid=2408088 medium]
The Scottish defence is nowhere to be seen and Fofana eases on the right wing to score an opportunistic try. Despite an easy angle,  Spedding fails to convert it. France leads 5-0.

[b]14th minute[/b]
Trying to keep possession for his team, Russell cannot anticipate the tackle and is badly knocked down.

[b]32nd minute[/b]
[imageid=2408089 medium]
Scotland keep the ball and dominate the game. They seem to play the French from one wing to the other and back. The home team is pushed back in its own 22m and the Scots try to find an opening along the touch line. Dunbar makes a silly handling mistake and the referee is quick to blow his whistle and ask for a scrum. As Russell gets back on his feet, a nice introduction by Kockott helps his team mates and France finally get the ball. In order to ease the pressure on his team and push the Scots back, he opts for a long kick and finds the touchline close to Scotland&#039;s 22m line.

[b]34th minute[/b]
Ford throws the ball in for Scotland but cannot focus his aim, offering it to the expert hand of France&#039;s Chouly. Well aware that such a chance may not present itself again, he grows wings and dodges the challenges of Beatty and Bennett. Fortunately for Scotland, Dunbar is there to save the day and brings Chouly down.

[b]36th minute[/b]
[imageid=2408090 medium]
Le Roux gathers the ball and passes it to Huguet who scores a great try without being challenged. Spedding makes amend for his previous miss and converts the try.

[b]Half-time[/b]
A lucky French team leads Scotland 12-0.

[i]next: second half, stay tuned![/i]</body>

Probably because I don&#039;t know the rules.

The material of the components may not be on par with the standards set by FFG or GW, but they are great to play with. There seems to be a will to launch a new series of miniatures to replace the flat player tokens. That would be really great (like that [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/285307/crash-tackle-rugby-board-game]example[/url]).

Funny enough, I was at a baseball game last year and a British family was sitting near me, they kept asking me a ton of questions, but I enjoyed explaining it to them. I never realized how odd the sport looks to people who don&#039;t know the rules. 

I mean, you have one pitcher who plays half the game, or more, and the other half is played by like 4 of them!

	<body>Playing on Easy Mode with Shadow cards

Oh man did I get lucky!  I actually played it pretty well, I got a good hand for the Spirit/Leadership deck. I put Steward of Gondor on Aragorn and got Northern Tracker out immediately and Sylvan guide out soon after that as well as Faramir. So, I was a questing beast (oops, wrong mythology!)  I intentionally chose Impassable Bog as my active location (has 12 quest tokens to be placed!) because I figured there was no way that I would get a low number of resources on Gollum&#039;s first time out of the Encounter deck. He starts out in the staging area and then you have to do escape tests-draw 2 cards and look at the escape value, but you have to have exhausted more characters to combat this and if you fail you put tokens on him, if he gets 8 he goes back in the deck until he comes out again. At the end though you must draw escape cards equal to the number of tokens on him and pass that test to win the game. 

Well, he had 7 tokens on him. I &quot;over-quested&quot; again and blew through the remainder of the Impassable Bog and the final 3 tokens needed and had to then pass the test. Thankfully I didn&#039;t use Aragorn, Glorfindel or a Gondorian Swordsman and could muster 6. I drew 7 cards. Only 1 was from the Dead Marshes deck!  The others were all Core and so didn&#039;t have &quot;Escape&quot; values on them and were therefore 0!  That Escape value? 1!!!!!  

So, I won. I nearly burned myself pretty badly with my own strategy, because then I would have had to go back to the first Quest card (of 2) and get 12 more tokens and find Gollum again, etc etc. 

Whew!  

I&#039;ll have to come back to this one (and several of the others), but right now I&#039;m just playing each one until I beat it. More for the adventure than anything.  </body>

[b]Almost disaster![/b]

Played Executioner&#039;s Song against the Kingpin.
With Maggia Goons, The Streets of New York, and the Marauders.

Spiderman was captured.

So it was up to Daredevil, Elektra, Blade, Deadpool, and Captain America to save the day.

Originally, I didn&#039;t like the Bribe ability of using Cash cards for Scratch cards, but when all hope was beginning to be lost, I became quite happy hitting the Kingpin with the bribes.

6 Spidey&#039;s were captured early on. 9 would have spelled D.O.O.M.
Also the henchmen and villain abilities of Ko&#039;ing heroes made it quite dangerous playing.

Blade was pretty hidden most of the game. Daredevil did most of the Damage. His guess a card number, kinda didn&#039;t do it for me. But then with some Spidey&#039;s saved, I could use Spidey&#039;s ability and then Daredevil&#039;s to pull in some big combos. :laugh:

	<body>A fun bowling game that enables you to play a league fairly quickly.

I finished up my Roller Rumble league this month, so I thought I would play a games of this PLAAY game that hasn&#039;t had as much playtime from me. After 5 games this weekend I think I will do an entire league.


:thumbsup: 2 ways to play, Spectator-mode and Participant-mode, with quick-play options for both. I usually use the spectator mode but the Participant mode does give a nice feel for actually bowling. 
:thumbsdown: There are some charts to refer to. Personally, I don&#039;t mind charts, but some people do. Most of the time the only chart needed is the bowler&#039;s card, but sometimes, for those really bad frames, a couple of other charts are needed. 
:thumbsup: It&#039;s bowling. I like to bowl every once in a while but I can&#039;t anymore because of my joints. This game has the same appeal without the added pain.
:thumbsdown:It&#039;s bowling. Some people would definitely be turned off. Even I thought it would be boring at first, but I&#039;m glad I gave it a shot.</body>

	<body>Ran a trial on this months ISGOYTRA tracks and did pretty well but I thought I could do a little bit better.  I used my SISU in the first special but I managed not to wreck the rest of the way.  I blew an acceleration die in the first short cut of special 2 but used assistance in between so I&#039;d be fresh for special 3.

I studied the track a little bit after I got my son off to bed and started my official run, I wanted to get it done before the new TWD started...

Special 1: I made better time throughout, even earned a few more time attack seconds.  I did have to use my SISU again on this run but I finished about 40 seconds faster than my test run! Off to a great start!

Special 2: I lost an acceleration die in that same shortcut! However, I managed to handle the middle bit a little more efficiently this time and improved on my test run by about 20 seconds! Woohoo!

Special 3: :thumbsup::!block::shake::thumbsup::!block::cry::gulp:  My total time after special 3 was now 24 seconds WORSE than my test run even after my big improvements in SS1 &amp; SS2.  Them&#039;s the breaks.  

I hope I&#039;ll have better luck on the monthly challenge anyway... plenty of more months ahead for me to catch up on points in the ISGOYTRA cup. :p

I&#039;ll turn in my times to Shaun after I get the monthly challenge done.

[size=7][b]Monthly Challenge[/b][/size]

My follies continued in my first trial run for the monthly challenge with the double downshift rules... I lost 4 gears by the time I made it 2/3 of the way through... I still played it out because I&#039;m a sucker for punishment.  My second trial run was much better - more than a full 6 minutes better. :p

Official run will be tomorrow when my dice tray is done drying.  I decided to stain it, add more felt, a two-way mirror and a pit boss.  

[b][size=9]Official run...[/size][/b]

The dice tray still reeks a bit of stain but I ran this month&#039;s challenge anyway.  I figured out a few ways to improve my time from my second trial run and gave it a go.  I&#039;m fairly pleased with the results (at least based on my test runs).

[o]I was fishin&#039; just a bit longer but not by much...

[youtube=hOIsYA1QDuk]
[/o]

I&#039;m also pretty happy with the pimped out version of my dice tray. :D

Before and after shots... this is just a wooden tray I found at Michael&#039;s for a few bucks plus two sheets of red self-adhesive felt and a stain job.

	<body>First play of this PNP that I&#039;d won back in December [i](along with Lord of the Rings)[/i] from [username=garyrbrooks].
[b]Thanks Gary![/b]



Hadrian and Renee were randomly chosen as the starting characters.
Round 1: 25 points
Round 2: 18 Points
Round 3: 12 Points
Total:  55 Points [i](Showy Seeker)[/i]

The first round went really smooth and I got through most of the deck before things started to really get bad.   In the second and third, Specters appeared early on which made the decision on whether to proceed much more difficult and forced early retreats.

------------

Mechanically this is a simple push-your-luck game that works along very similar lines as [thing=37759][/thing]/[thing=15512][/thing], where you get more points the further you go, and where some of the bad doesn&#039;t happen until the second time you see a particular card.  The encounters throw an extra wrinkle into it, but some can actually help you quite a bit.   The four different player abilities add some options as well, and also add a bit of replayability and variety as you try out the different combinations [i](only two get used each game)[/i].

Thematically the push-your-luck mechanism fits really well into the concept of exploring a haunted house because it&#039;s very much a matter of seeing how far you can go and how scared you can get before you&#039;ve had enough.  The &quot;loss&quot; trigger fits even better than it does in IG/D because that always seemed to imply that your adventurer was killed [i](which didn&#039;t make as much sense with multiple rounds)[/i], while in this game it basically means you shit yourself and ran screaming out of the house.  You&#039;re still alive, but you&#039;re not getting any points for bravery...   unless you go back in and try again.

:thumbsup:  Highly thematic fit to the push-your-luck gameplay
:thumbsup:  PNP made up of just over 30 cards, so it&#039;s very easy to build and transport.  It would be completely playable even if you printed just one side and didn&#039;t include the card backs.
:thumbsup:  Plays super quick and has a tiny footprint, so it&#039;s a great option when you have only a few minutes free and little to no space available.

:thumbsdown:  Very luck-driven.   You do have some control over when to back out, but with good luck you can ride it out far longer than with bad luck.
:thumbsdown:  It&#039;s a high score chaser.  You can&#039;t really &quot;lose&quot; unless you manage to panic all three rounds, so your measure of success depends almost entirely on how you&#039;ve done in previous games.
:thumbsdown:  Replayability seems somewhat limited.  The four characters can be mixed to provide variety, but without the high score chase there&#039;s not a lot to draw you back.</body>

	<body>Last night I played the first reconnaissance scenario to get back into the swing of things.  Tonight I&#039;m playing the [thread=1315341][/thread] hosted by :
[user=flannc][/user]
This challenge is based off the [thread=936337]Draconum infestation[/thread] variant.  I&#039;m half way through so far and really enjoying this.  Playing Tovak, I ended the second day at level 7.  All three villiges are freed of the draconum.  I&#039;m just approaching the blue city which hosts two random draconum.  I should be through that in the night phase.

:thumbsup: I don&#039;t mind the AP with this game at all.  I&#039;ll stare at my card for 10 minutes with glee as I solve the puzzle of my current turn.
:thumbsup: This challenge is very fun.  I&#039;ve never played anything other than the introduction and conquest scenarios.  This is a nice change of pace.
[b]EDIT:2/10[/b]

Finished this variant tonight with a score of 206.  I had some spells and AA that helped ease the threats of the Draconum.  Here are the details of my city battles:

[b]Day 3[/b]
Blue city â Ice and High Dragon.
I cast Tremor on the Ice Dragon giving it -3 armor (down to 4).  The Fire Golems finished it off before it could attack with a ranged fire attack 4.
Since these are not fortified I used the Illusionist to prevent the High Dragon from attacking.  I hit it with the cold swordmanship (attack 2),  Utem Guardsmen hit it for 2,  3 from the Soul Harvester,  and 3 from the Utem Swordsmen.  9 normal attacks.  The blue city is saved and I&#039;m rewarded with the Altem Guardians.

I decided with my last turn of the round to assault the Red City.  I had a good hand and tranquility.  I might as well take out a few enemies before assaulting the city again in the night phase.  Revealed were: a High Dragon, Fire Dragon, Fire Mages, and Ice Golems.  The red city fortifies them and gives them the brutal ability.  Also, the city has a white crystal and according to the variant rules I canât use white powers here.

I used Cold Toughness (6 ice block) to block the fire mages.  I used shield Mastery (2 fire block) to block the Ice Golems.  Altem Guardians (8 block), Rage and 2 cards sideways were used to block the high dragon.
The unblocked Fire Dragon hit me with 18 pts of brutal damage to disburseâ¦ouch!  Fire Golems absorb 8, Utem Guardsmen absorb 5, Illusionists absorb 2, leaving me taking one wound with the final 3.
My turn.  Snowstorm + Cold Swordmanship kill the Fire Dragon.  Fireball kills the Ice Golems.

[b]Night 3[/b]
Only one thing left to do, conquer the Red City.   Using the Sparing Power tactic I assaulted the city with 10 cards.  Using black mana, I turned the Snowstorm into a Blizzard (Ice Siege 8) killing the Fire Mages.  The High Dragon was blocked using Cold Toughness, Shield Mastery and Rage (12 total block).  Using the remaining cards I easily generated 9 normal attack points to slay the dragon.

:thumbsup: I like the revealed map.  It really allows you to plan out an strategy right from the start.
:thumbsup: A bad hand is rare (personal opinion).  Even when I think I have a bad hand, I always find a way to use it efficiently.</body>

Solo AP is not antisocial so you won&#039;t get arrested for it  :)

However, I do find that the more I play this game the less puzzly it feels. To be honest I don&#039;t consider it puzzly at all any more. The theme rules for me.

I am REALLY intollerant of AP, to be honest it makes me grouchy.... I&#039;m getting old so every second counts :D

I try never to take more than 5 mins for a turn even in a complex game like GMT&#039;s CDG&#039;s.... I consider it my civic duty. I&#039;d sooner lose than find gaming a chore.

I was starting to get to that point too when I was playing consistently.  That&#039;s until I reached he cities.  THat would usually take a good amount of time to plan the attack.

I agree with you about AP though, I don&#039;t want to spend time staring at the game.  Especially when the majority of my play happens at night when I&#039;m already a little tired.  But I just never minded it with this game.

I have the same attitude, just with this game, for some reason.  On occasion, I have stared at my cards for more than 10 mins, I am sure.  I feel like i&#039;m moving fast if 1 round (a night or a day) takes less than 30 mins!

Dislike for AP is one of the things that makes vassal pbem so great to me. Doesn&#039;t matter what game or which opponents I play, there&#039;s never any AP apparent.

Have had some great 3 player games of MK on vassal, always got one going and the current one, on the last day turn is my best ever score to this point.

	<body>Was challenged by a co-worker that I wouldn&#039;t play this after I got through the first battle, so of course I had to prove him wrong.  Setup for this game is so easy really once you sort and bag the counters.  Except for markers, the units are used in only one scenario, so like [thing=42673][/thing] you can just bag up all the ones for a given map.

This time I took on Bentonville, which only lasts 6 turns.  This one starts with a lot of units already on board and the Union phases in reinforcements randomly over turns 2-5.  To win, the Confederates only need to capture one of 6 objectives.  If none, then the winner is determined by victory points.

[imageid=2408320medium]

About turn 3 I realized I needed to use the Union forces to keep some of the rebels engaged away from the objectives and the rest to close in on the objectives and protect them in sort of a zone defense.

For the CSA, I tried to use my cavalry unit (just one) to skirt the perimeter through the woods, but in the end didn&#039;t make it close enough due to movement restrictions.

The CSA fought well up until the last turn, closing in and managed to take one objective and contest a few more (via zone of control), however they were driven off via the two attack pulls and the Union elite moved and occupied 5 objectives and controlled the sixth.

However...

The next to the last chit pulled was D.H. Hill&#039;s Corps of the CSA.  They were only two units strong to begin with and were both reduced and on opposite ends of the battlefield.  But the westernmost unit, closest to the objectives had kept moving over to support and had just enough time to move into the only unoccupied spot, [b]giving the CSA a substantial victory![/b]

[imageid=2408333medium]

Had it gone to points, the Union would have eeked it out 23-21.</body>

[imageid=2408351 medium]

Scored another 85.5 (110 is listed as an &quot;excellent&quot; score). This time however I could see a route to a higher score. I made one miscalculation, but almost had enough to purchase another 15vp building on my last turn that would have brought me to 100.5. Feeling kind of addicted to this one.</body>

:what:

Yeah the sheep got a little out of hand!

I misjudged my grain levels on the last turn or I would have had a much better score this time around.

As an aside, when I first bought this game I was missing the two grain indicator tokens from the box. I emailed Z-man games about a replacement. They were in my mailbox 5 business days after I sent the email. Amazing customer service.

	<body>Due to the lousy weather here in Toronto, my construction work site has been shut down for the week. A great opportunity to hibernate with my game collection. Set up this awesome GMT game before bed tonight so I can leap right into the campaign game in the morning.

[imageid=2408356 medium]

[b]Update 09/02: [/b]

So played the full campaign this evening. The whole thing took me about 5-6 hours (not sure exactly what time I got started). Very immersive experience. I lost badly.  14 Lancasters and countless crew lost. The effectiveness of Group 5 was seriously damaged and both Bomber Command and the Ministry of Aircraft Production were very disappointed in the results. A catastrophic loss so bad that Churchill suppressed news of the raid from the public. No Dam Busters movie in my alternate timeline.

Now I have had a full run through, I have a better idea of how to manage the pre-mission planning and training. My sloppiness around security (especially requesting too many resources) cost me dearly in the final raids. Almost every dam turned out to have added significant defenses since the last reconnaissance. The added spotlights in particular made it almost impossible to breach the dams. 

I think the next time I play the full campaign I am going to split it over two nights, my brain hurts! 

:thumbsup: In-depth and engaging look at a very specific event in history.
:thumbsup: For a procedural game, I find there are a significant number of choices, particularly in the full campaign game.
:thumbsup: Great components and a beautifully designed map, with some of the most useful player aids in any game I have played.
:thumbsup::thumbsdown: Definitely a procedural game. If you don&#039;t like that style of gameplay you won&#039;t like this one, but if you do this is a fantastic example of how to do it right.
:thumbsdown: My enjoyment of this game has led me to an interest in [thing=39941][/thing], another procedural game that generates an interesting looking narrative.

I&#039;m looking forward to &quot;Scenario 10&quot; myself.  I agree, it&#039;s easy to get lost in story, get lost in the game, and lose.  Just lose.

	<body>I finally have played Claustrophobia thanks to 

[username=reverendunclebastard]

and the idea to play it both sides like he mentioned [listitem=3694830]here[/listitem].

Claustrophobia has sitten on my shelf for a long time now and I just have never gotten it to the table to play it with my girlfried. Even though I really think that she would enjoy the game. She loves playing [thing=104162][/thing] and she loves rolling dice. Claustrophobia would be the perfect game for her, wouldn&#039;t it? I think so. But in reality we always end up playing something different so I thought to my self, I should try to play both sides and see if I would have fun.

I had a lot of fun...:thumbsup:

The fact that there are not much (or even none?) hidden informations and your actions are determined by the outcome of the dice-rolling makes playing both sides a fun way to enjoy the game. It felt a bit like watching a story unfolding. But I constantly had the &quot;what to do next &amp; what is the best thing to help my guys or the demons&quot;- feeling, and thats awesome. 

I have never done playing both sides in a game and that was a new and exciting experience. So much that I was very intrigued by [listitem=3725155]this mention of playing Memoir&#039;44 both sides[/listitem]. [thing=10630][/thing] is a game I always wanted to try out but never found another player (my girlfrined would not play a game about WW2). But it seems like Memoir&#039;44 could give me the same experience like I had with Claustrophobia. That&#039;s awesome and it&#039;s now very high on my wishlist.

So I only had one game so far (first scenario) and the humans won, but I guess I made some gameplay mistakes on the demons side. It&#039;s great to acknowledge those mistakes. Makes me want to play again and see if the humans can cash in another easy win.

:thumbsup: I can play such a great game whenever I want to

:thumbsup: It&#039;s beautiful. By the end of the game you have got an entire dungeon on your table plus great looking miniatures.

:thumbsup: As a dungeon crawler it plays fast so you can play a couple of games in quick succession

:thumbsdown: I wish there were more different bad guys</body>

I traded this quite quickly because I found the replayability low. It may have improved with expansions but the game was gone by then.

Glad you enjoyed it Sebastian! I am slowly working on an AI for the demons. Lots of playtesting to do. Until then I have enjoyed playing this both sides a few times now.

I picked up the first expansion of this, it does add some new human characters and one new type of demon character, plus a dozen scenarios.

If your going to play Memoir 44&#039; here is a good simple solo solution so that you never truly have control over the AI side.
[url]https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/103650/simple-solo-game-sheet[/url]

I use this variant and I get beat by it plenty since there still is a fog of war for which card the AI has or which one will be used the next turn.

Enjoy!

	<body>Did one more game of this with the base game stuff only (except I mixed in the Map cards from Shifting Winds...helped a lot!). After being stomped all over in the previous game, I went back to starting the Darkness track at default instead of at 5. I also picked my four favorite characters from the previous plays: the Rogue, Wizard, Scholar, and Knight. To compensate for choosing my characters, I selected their starting powers at random.

This was definitely the dream team for me so far. The Rogue is just insanely good at searching and remaining undetected. He&#039;s no good at fighting, but he&#039;s good enough at eluding that it doesn&#039;t matter unless he needs to defeat a blight for some reason. The Wizard is the most fun to play with his frankly overpowered abilities (balanced out by his low default grace and the fact that most of his powers need to be exhausted after use). When he got the Rune of Interference, giving him a 1/6 chance of instantly destroying every new blight that spawned, that was a real game-changer for this playthrough. The Scholar was also good at searching, although squishier than the Rogue. I parked him at the Swamp and tried to find an Inspiration. Finally, I got to play with a lot more of the Knight&#039;s Oaths this time. They&#039;re very fun and make her a great asset in combat--it was a no-brainer to give her the three keys to collect the Relic and defeat the Necromancer at the end.

This game is so good, it&#039;s not even funny. I&#039;m sorely tempted to get the Into the Abyss expansion, and I haven&#039;t even played with the other two yet! The rules tend to be straightforward, but there are a few I find myself occasionally forgetting: you lose 1 secrecy when attacking a blight, and if you fail the attack, you need to apply the blight&#039;s defense. I also sometimes forget to draw an Event card in the heat of the moment. I think I caught all of my mistakes as I was making them, though, and I&#039;m getting comfortable enough with what the blights do that I can start putting them face-up on the board, which makes it a lot more attractive.

I also played another game of [b][thing=155708][/thing][/b] earlier. I chose two more random heroes, excluding the ones I&#039;ve seen so far, and ended up with the Druid and the Oracle. I also randomized which side of the Regions I used. I don&#039;t know whether it was the new heroes, the regions, the Horde deck, the Epic Foe, or my own poor play, but I lost badly this time. I was holding onto the game okay, with just one destroyed region when the Epic Foe appeared, but he was the Giant...at the start of the round, he knocked the heroes over, meaning they couldn&#039;t defend or do anything else until they used an action to stand up. Well, I was halfway through the Turn deck before my heroes got a single action, and by that time, the Capital was well on its way to ruin. Boo!

thanks for continuing to post about Darkest Night.  Almost as good as having the game!  Almost...  

As for TED, I&#039;m starting to wonder if the timing of the action cards in the final round is the overarching predictor of success (along with being able to get artifacts).  In our last game, playing hard mode, we seemed to be losing consistently, and lost a region early 2nd round.  But when the epic came out, our move cards were in the top half of the deck, and we dispatched him quickly.

I think the same thing. It&#039;s not a completely luck-driven game, but a bad run of enemy cards in the later rounds can be literally impossible to react to. And artifacts are of the utmost importance--for various reasons, I only got 1 artifact in this game, and I think that definitely hurt me.

If you get 4 hero turn cards at the start of the round the Epic Foe enters play, yeah, you are probably going to win. (May not be true for all Epic Foes.)

But that luck of the draw is an integral part of the game. I think it&#039;s excused by the game&#039;s shortness and lightness.

If you wanted, you could prepare the deck after the Epic Foe appears so that each half of the deck contains 2 hero turn cards and half of the enemy cards. While that would be more fair and consistent, I don&#039;t think it would improve the game for me.

I hope you love Darkest Night when you finally get it. I&#039;m loving the heck out of it.

Byron,  thanks for posting all about Darkest Night. It&#039;s really getting me excited about this game again. Your enthusiasm is really inspiring me to take it off the shelf and play it. I have to finish learning Cuba Libre before I tackle something new, but it will be very soon that this game gets played. 

I don&#039;t have the Necromancer Bundle, I just have everything separate and I can&#039;t get them all to fit in the main box. So, I splurged for the larger box. However, I&#039;m really lucky because my parents live about two miles from VPG. So, my dad just drove over and picked it up for me. They are coming to visit this weekend so he&#039;s bringing it with him. It feels like a much smarter purchase when I didn&#039;t have to pay for shipping. :) 

On a side note, VPG is just awesome. I called them and they said they didn&#039;t have any in stock, but then I was told that whey would print one up for me and they did! Great, great company!

Yeah, I&#039;m new to their games, but they seem great both in terms of quality of gameplay and in customer service. And I think their component quality is really good, too, especially their laser-cut tokens that almost feel like wood. I really want to try to support them more by buying their games direct from the website, or at least getting retail copies instead of secondhand.

The robot crushed me last night 34-10 or so.  It started with Old Earth and seemed to roll the &#039;x2&#039; action every turn.  It collected 21 VP chits while I had the other 3.  I think we both had 5 or 6 cards out.  It was over quick.

	<body>So I&#039;ve lurked these board for the better part of a year after getting my copy of Mage Knight - which consequently, got me into this whole solo board gaming mess. I have since suffered from a bad case of GAS - Game Acquisition Syndrome (stolen from my musician friends).

I usually have the opportunity to put up two solo games at a time. On the dining room table in the basement I have Robinson Crusoe set up for the second scenario and on the dining room table upstairs, I played a session of At the Gates of Loyang.

I was stymied for most of the game, only having one regular customer for the first five rounds; finally drawing a second one in the card offer in the 6th.

Posted an abysmal 14.6 - although I did have  16.12 BEFORE seeing the challenge! Poop...

Anyway, can&#039;t wait to post much more in the coming weeks and months.</body>

Well the solution to GAS is your FART (Fast Acquisition [i]Retirement[/i] Team) here at BGG; sell some games. :yuk:  Remember, GAS is internally generated, but it helps to avoid BEANS (Browsing Each And every New Sale) or (Buying Everything Always Now Syndrome).

	<body>[b][size=18]ORIGIN STORY[/size][/b]

Recent converts to the SGoYT lists may not even recognize me, but I&#039;ve been here from the start. In the past few months I&#039;ve built a house, got a promotion, and had a baby, so coming here to post has been lower priority. I still do read all your posts, though!

Here&#039;s a fun piece of history to go back and read: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/156765/may-solitaire-gaming-month/page/1?]the very first SGoYT thread[/url]. Although it wasn&#039;t called that when Albert got it going. Go give it a read. You&#039;ll recognize a few of the posters as being regulars around here, and it&#039;s fun to see some of the same games show up (my favorite: Hostage Negotiator is on that very first list, and I&#039;m getting excited about getting a physical copy and adding it to lists two years older!). Scroll down to the bottom and you&#039;ll see Ryan start the next list and name it SGoyT. The rest is history.

[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/156765/item/2651593#item2651593]My first post[/url] there was Dawn of the Zeds. Coming up on two years later, I&#039;ve just done another play with the expansion mixed in.

I [i]think[/i] I&#039;ve had at least one post every month since. I don&#039;t post as often as I&#039;d like because (except for a couple times recently), I tend to be very wordy ([url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/169311/item/3085395#item3085395]there[/url] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/179645/item/3536412#item3536412]are[/url] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/178257/item/3438655#item3438655]lots[/url] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/176697/item/3386096#item3386096]of[/url] [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/172996/item/3252423#item3252423]examples[/url]). The :thumbsup::thumbsdown: approach to review just doesn&#039;t work for me.

I keep coming back because of the people. The people you recognize from Albert&#039;s first May list are now people I&#039;ve been gaming &quot;with&quot; for almost two years. They&#039;ve [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/172996/item/3202533#item3202533]participated in my challenges[/url], [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/169311/item/3085395?commentid=4446733#comment4446733]rooted me on[/url], [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/171003/item/3170584#item3170584]bought me stuff[/url], and even [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1011853/wip-2013-solo-pnp-harbinger-project-defeating-enem]playtested my games[/url]. I&#039;ve met a couple of them face-to-face for multiplayer games, and met up with a few for Vassal games.

And the people who are newer to this list are people I look forward to sharing games with in the future over the [i]next[/i] two years.</body>

	<body>The fourth encounter. Finally! I decided to play the Witch-King and before I even made my first move I wondered, could it be that this is the most difficult character to play unless you really know how magic works?

I guess I made many mistakes (again) but this really is no easy game. Help appreciated.

[ImageID=2408651]

I decided to go on an adventure from the Book of Quests again. Last time I was hunting that dragon and couldn&#039;t find it, this time I decided to hunt down a demon. Why not?

[b]Passage into Darkness[/b]

This is a short but brutal story. It took me exactly 2 phases to discover where that demon is, not like on my dragon hunt where I was running through the whole realm and was killed by a giant. Dragon? There are no dragons in [thing=22][/thing]!

The spells I took were:
- Fiery Blast
- Lightning Bolt
- Pentangle
- Broomstick (I wanted to have Melt into Mist first but how does this damn spell work? Can someone explain it to me? Can I move with it from Hex to Hex or from Clearing to Clearing? Can I move with it at all? I don&#039;t get it.)

Broomstick was cast and I was flying around. First hex, nothing. Second hex..... Lost castle. I was unhidden, so I turned those chits around. Monster roll was 1 &amp; 2! This time I rolled 2 dice for the monsters, I did not forget it. Now what do we have here:

[ImageID=2408653]

Well, I found my demon. Damn that was fast! But since I was unhidden and the monster roll was 1 and 2 those guys:

[ImageID=2408654]

attacked me. I did not even roll. I just died. Crying. I am not sure if I played this correct. Again, help appreciated.

Set up time was faster this time. It took me around 45 minutes I guess. But I am not sure if I can get it any faster. Even though I have everything sorted into tons of plastic bags and ready to be placed as soon as the markers are out.
Play time today? Well I guess with rules re-reading... 30 minutes? :D

:thumbsup: If I master this game one day it will be a dream come true. The options you have, the adventures you can go on, the characters...
:thumbsdown: What a chaotic rulebook. Really. If you&#039;re looking for something and you are not sure where exactly it is... it will cost you a lot of time finding it. Like the spells! Spells are cast during evening. Ok. Ok? No. What about the Fly spells? Do I also cast them in the evening? But when do I actually move? Argh! Need to get back to the reading part!

I guess I should first have gotten myself more spells. First mistake. Maybe some armor? Second mistake. And the microbadge of the Witch-King of course. Third mistake! Need to get that one...;)</body>

[q]Dragon? There are no dragons in Magic Realm![/q]
Just to clarify for those unfamiliar with the game, there are dragons (including the infamous Tremendous Flying Dragon). They just don&#039;t always show up--so if you&#039;re hunting for one, sometimes there won&#039;t be any (and then a giant will come along and kill you).

If I remember it correct you only need to find the hoard or the lair to fight the dragon and free the girl when playing that first quest from the book of quests. But I could not even find that. :D [geekurl=/geeklist/186592/item/3711445#item3711445]Here[/geekurl] is a small report about it.

I had eyed this one for a while, then I heard that White Dog were no longer listing it so swiftly ordered it from Noble Knight games.  Postage was pricey and I was hit by a customs charge - oh dear.

Then I heard a new version was to be produced with &quot;bells and whistles&quot; - double oh dear.

With That in mind on opening I was slightly disappointed with the production values - they&#039;re not bad but they are on the &#039;keeping the cost down&#039; side of things i.e. very thin cards, stiff paper map.  The counters though are great, lovely and thick and generally speaking I do like the design.

[center][imageid=2408728]
Lots of suppression after a particularly heavy Artillery Barrage[/center]

But that is all so much sausage, let&#039;s get the meat and bones.

After one play - I like the game.  It plays nicely, it&#039;s a different kind of wargame and the mechanisms really fit the theme.  It&#039;s very much a grind down but the real action is in setting units up to be evacuated and making the most of your time to do that. You get hemmed in and attacked and pounded all the while trying to get more and more units together and on to the escape routes.  All very thematic.

I finished with a score of AWFUL which I&#039;m pleased about, you wouldn&#039;t want to do well in a game on your first go when you&#039;re not really sure what you&#039;re doing now would you?

:thumbsup: Good game
:thumbsup: Very different angle for a war-type game
:thumbsup: Good rulebook (but could do with an index)
:thumbsup: Small footprint
:thumbsup: Good player aid but could do with a couple of small additions
:thumbsdown: Fiddly set up (but not terrible)
:thumbsdown: Need more dice

I bought the pnp pdf from White Dogs Games last year. A closer look at your counters makes me regret the pdf optionâ¦ 

It is an excellent fast playing wargame with a very original approach: itâs not common to do your best to flee from the enemy...

For those who are interested in the game, it is no longer available from White Dog Games but the pdf files are now available for free : http://theboardgamingway.com/free-pnp-copy-spoiled-victory-dunkirk-1940/

And for those who donât like to DIY, the designer, Hermann Luttmann is re-designing it with more &quot;bells and whistles&quot;. It will be published by Legion Wargames with a new name : [b][gameid=171868][/b]

Thanks guys! 
Yes indeed, the physical package offered by Legion Wargames will make this game much nicer to look at. I&#039;m also adding some layers to the gameplay - ship counters that will be used to actually transport the evacuees back to Dover, there are more units, artillery is added, etc. - but yet keep it at the same playing time. 
Stay tuned!
Hermann

	<body>I know the game since it was published. It plays fast, it&#039;s puzzly, it&#039;s thematic, it&#039;s challenging. So many qualities... I like that game a lot. 
What I didn&#039;t notice before last month was that there is a story in it.... and it&#039;s funny.

[b][i]personal back-up story[/b][/i]

Last Christmas, my father - who will be 83 in a week and has never played a boardgame in his life - asked me to find a solo boardgame he could play. 
First idea that came to my mind while talking with him was Infection. However, he doesn&#039;t understand English: I had to translate the rules and the cards in French. 
I assumed, it would not be an easy task. 

Before initiating translation, I asked for advices [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1291377/help-me-choose-solo-boardgame-lifetime][b]in the 1st Player Guild Forum[/url][/b]. I received a lot of very interesting suggestions (I&#039;m still working on two of them) but as I &quot;sold&quot; Infection to my father in the first place, he was really interested in playing that particular game.

It took me more time than I expected. 
It is especially challenging to translate cards. Very often, it takes several words in French whereas English use one or two to express the same idea. 
Anyway, I did finish the translation just in time to send the game to my father for his birthday [i](it was the initial goal).[/i]

[imageid=2408761medium]


[b][i] my revelation regarding infection story [/b][/i]

When I play, I focus on the effects [i](place a molecule here or there, substract 1 or add 2 to your die roll...) [/i] and not on the ambiance text.
 
The translation forced me to read every single word on the cards. 
That&#039;s was a mistake to ignore the ambiance text. It&#039;s really worth it. 

There is a true life in this Laboratory! 
Adam, who is the youngest team&#039;s member, is really a nice &quot;kid&quot;. He fells asleep regularly which pisses of Amanda whereas Sylvia is more forgiving. He disguises Marvin - the RatLab - when he&#039;s got some free time and watches TV a lot! The relationship are tensed between the Lab guys and the story develops in few-well-chosen words.

On the other hand, there is also a life outside the Lab. The death section tells that story like a never-ending-scrolling informations at the bottom of the TV screen while watching the TV-news.

Just don&#039;t know how I could have missed the excellent job they did with the story in this game. 
It cannot be called a &quot;story-telling&quot; game, though, but there is a story. I will play it with new eyes now :D

:thumbsup: Fast playing, Thematic, challenging and funny!
:thumbsdown: Highly improbable to save humanity playing the viral level
:thumbsdown: Unlucky die rolls. There is a lot of luck involved in that game, anyway. I don&#039;t mind but some do...

[b][u][size=12]Update[/size][/b][/u]: I did save the world for the last time (I cowardly played the bacterial side and I was insanely lucky during mutations steps, though...) before sending the game to my Father. 
I also did my first (highly unprofessional) video playthrough to teach him the game.

[imageid=2414830medium]

Humanity&#039;s fate will be in his hands starting from Monday [i] (if French post-office permitted)[/i].</body>

Thanks for sharing, Koinsky. :)

That&#039;s a lot of work to translate so many cards. I truly hope that your father enjoys the game.

As for the Infection story, I spent 3 days working on the text of the cards. I tried to envision it like a movie, but I had to keep in mind that the cards would be pulled in random order, so there could be no real linear plot. Think of it more like a movie trailer where they show you a series of quick clips that might not be in the same order as they appear in the movie. They give you a sense of the drama (and humor) of the film without dwelling on any particular scene.

It was like trying to write a novel but I could only use a Tweet amount of characters per scene. :D

So yeah, it was very gratifying to read about your appreciation of the story and its characters.

That is great, Koinsky. I&#039;m sure your dad will live it. This sounds like a very special present.

You&#039;re right about the story! I love it. One of my favorite moments is when Sylvia places a blanket over a sleeping Adam.

Do you, really? :D

I&#039;ll translate his thoughts with pleasure (here and/or in the Guild) but I wouldn&#039;t wait for it soon. He has always soooo many things to do [retired people! :)] he&#039;ll probably take his time before giving me any feedback on the gameplay.

	<body>Having played through The First Waves scenario a couple of times to get the rules down I&#039;ve now started my play through of the full Two Days in Hell scenario.

I don&#039;t like to clutter this list with detailed session reports (disclaimer: I&#039;m not knocking anyone who does it&#039;s merely personal preference on my part!) so if you want to read up on the woes of the 2nd Marine Division then head over to the [geekurl=/forum/740202]game&#039;s Session forum[/geekurl]. I&#039;ve only completed the first 10 turns so far and therefore splitting the session into several posts. It&#039;s got pics! They&#039;re not very exciting but they are definitely pictures. :)

It is a bit of a conundrum for me whether to post the session report here, in the game forum, or both. Not that I&#039;m a big session writer (yet), but it&#039;s something I wonder about.

I figure, when you post here you&#039;re adding to the health of SGoYT and when you post on a game&#039;s page, you&#039;re adding to the health of the game.  Both are good things, so why not do both?  If you didn&#039;t post here, I&#039;d never have the opportunity to see it (as I don&#039;t frequent the DDay page) and likewise, someone researching the game DDay would never see it if you didn&#039;t post to its specific page.

Personal Experience:  When Shadows of Brimstone first came out I was ravenous for session reports.  Some were getting posted to the board, but I&#039;ve stumbled across a lot that were posted in other forums, blogs, etc.  I would have loved to have those things also posted to the SoB forum for easier access.

[u][i]My [/i][/u]hesitancy about &quot;double posting&quot; comes from it feeling self-serving or self-aggrandizing.  After all, it IS gratifying to get feedback and having double exposure gives more feedback.  But I think in this case, it&#039;s not only OK, but a potentially good thing for the hobby and the game itself.

I really like it when people do what you have done here - post a link on here to your session report on the game page (a direct link might be nicer though).  That way those interested can click through and others can pass on by.  I know an extra click can be annoying but first world problems and all that.

Also, I think it&#039;s great when people sum up their opinions about the game here but go into more session details in their reports.

So, nice work!

But feel free to do it however you want to do it - no harm in double postings.

Then someone comes along with a well reasoned opinion that make me question everything I thought was true, thanks for that  :p

For the sake of consistency (and my undiagnosed OCD) I&#039;ll probably post my last BTech session in full, but after that I&#039;ll try out exactly what you described above: Sum up my opinion on here and provide a link to the full report.  (I [i]was[/i] a little self-conscious about how much real estate my last session took up :) )

	<body>My third game for today! And my second time for [thing=84419][/thing].

[ImageID=2408906]

I played the Doomsday Machine solo mission again. Easy mode of course.

This time I wanted to have more ships on the board when the first DM was about to attack. The first planets to colonize were 2 hexes away from my HS.

[ImageID=2408907]

My HS was surrounded by minerals. Which was a good thing. My Scouts were exploring and exploring finding planets, minerals and everything else but Danger! markers - good.
But one of my three Colony Ships got destroyed by a black hole. Damn!

[ImageID=2408908]

The Scouts were in the game almost until the end. And while writing this down I realised that my DMs were coming in too soon! :D I let them appear after turn 7, 9 and 11 and NOT in economic phase 7, 9 and 11. That makes it of course an unbeatable challenge. :D Ok second game at all. Still learning...

Anyway I had lots of fun getting destroyed by those killing machines. I almost took the first one down with the three CAs I managed to bring in. But the dice again. Today they hate me. Attack rolls on my side - bad, attack rolls for the DM - score, score, score...

[ImageID=2408909]

The DM attack is a powerful one and my last fleet was no match for them. (of course not, since I played it too hard)

[ImageID=2408910]

Those two DMs entered both in area 8 and that was a straight line to two of my colonies and my HS. The third DM entered in 2 but did not even matter. Next time I need to play this correct.

I played wrong (again) but it was good for learning how battle is done. Next time, with more time to build a good defense I think I can handle at least one of those DM with no problem. (if the dice are on my side)

[ImageID=2408911]

One big :thumbsdown: for myself for making this big mistake. :shake:
One big :thumbsup: for the game, because I am already addicted! Can&#039;t wait to bring it on the table again. To read the tech sheet only makes me plan my defense and counter attack on those DMs! Next time you bastards I bring you down!</body>

i also only started playing this game this month!
sofar i really enjoy it  - setting up your empire while knowing about the impending doom has a good tension. 
with a very lucky planet distribution, an useful alien technology find (and lucky die rolls of course) i actually managed a win but still cannot imagine how to do this in a harder setting! (- post will be following below shortly!)

	<body>I brought this back out this month (don&#039;t worry Navajo Wars - you&#039;ll be back soon!).  Two games so far, one a clear Jihadist victory (ouch!), but then the luckiest game I&#039;ve ever had for the US.  The Jihadist AI was stuck with Serbia and China on its first two radicalization placement rolls, and with plenty of cells available, kept recruiting there (I kept the rest of the board clear of cells and cadres besides IR Afghanistan).  Relatively free of interference (and with a hand that was full of 3 point cards), I was able to Regime Change Iraq with Iraqi WMD and a couple of action phases later, get it to Good (thanks Mass Turnout!).  With Gulf States also on Good Ally, I was well placed for the Oil Price Spike coming out of the Jihadist hand.  Two lucky successful rolls later, and Saudi is Good Ally - 12 Good Resources victory with half the deck remaining!  This was my first solo victory before the shuffle.  Love this game!  :D</body>

	<body>[b][u]Challenge 7, Week 4[/u][/b]

[b]Villain:[/b] Citizen Dawn

[b]Environment:[/b] Ruins of Atlantis

[size=18][b]Score: 56[/b][/size]
Rounds: 10
Wounds: 38
Dawn Heals: 8

[b]Hero Wounds (order of play):[/b]
Visionary: 16
Absolute Zero: 8
Wraith: 14

Finally, a victory on my sixth attempt at this challenge!  The win feels very satisfying, for I had just about despaired of beating it with this set of heroes.  It seemed like every time I got something going, Devastating Aurora would turn up and set the heroes back.  Absolute Zero in particular has a tough time with that card -- it takes him a few turns to get going even without interference, and it is just, well, devastating when his board gets wiped.

Ideally of course, the heroes can manage some villain deck control to keep the Aurora&#039;s out of the game, but I found that even with Infrared Eyepiece going, things could transpire such that a D.A. showed up despite my best efforts to keep it away.  Those cards which play an extra villain card per turn can scupper the best-laid plans this way.

My other issue in previous sessions was somewhat self-inflicted: I tended to lose focus and hit citizens when I should have been concentrating on Dawn herself.  After several sessions, I started to figure out which citizens were not urgent threats and to leave them on the board in favor of directing damage at Dawn.  This, I&#039;m convinced is the key to beating her: you simply have to take her down as quickly as possible and ignore all but the most dire distractions.  Yes, the heroes will take damage, but it&#039;s a race they can win if they get a bit of luck and have some time to set up (i.e., avoid Devastating Auroras).

[b]Visionary[/b] contributed in several small but significant ways.  I chose to use her primarily for her inherent power, which is invaluable in helping Absolute Zero get set up early in the game.  And in the event, this is exactly what she did.  She then got Mental Divergence out, which she used to take out some of Dawn&#039;s more annoying ongoings.  She later drew a Wrest the Mind and the Cocoon, which is a great combo.  She first played Wrest the Mind on a recently-arrived Mystical Defenses, making sure that she took enough damage to take her down to 10 HP so she could be the lowest HP hero (the better to suck up hits from Krakens when no citizens were available), and on her next turn went into the Telekinetic Cocoon.  She pumped as much Mystical Defense damage into Citizen Dawn as she could, and then remained in the Cocoon because, yes, there were two Krakens out.  Finally, Visionary used Mass Levitation a few round to cut down on damage from the environment cards.  Visionary came out of her cocoon in the final round to play a Mind Spike on Dawn so she could participate in the final takedown.

[b]Absolute Zero[/b] was able to get set up about as quickly as possible thanks to Visionary helping him draw cards.  He started with a Null Point Calibration Unit in hand, but to really get going, he needs Isothermic Transducer, Thermal Shockwave and Focused Aperture.  With this, he can start to both do damage and heal himself each turn.  His second card play was an Impale which he stuck on Dawn, and this was responsible for 9 damage over the course of the session.  Once he had his equipment suite up, he started to do steady damage using Thermal Shockwave while keeping himself healthy.

[b]Wraith[/b] did what she does with her equipment, but her focus throughout was using the Infrared Goggles she began the game with.  She was thus able to bury both Devastating Aurora&#039;s during the game.  Before her Utility Belt appeared, she forwent stealth in order to keep checking the villain deck each turn.  The goggles also helped to bury the more annoying citizens, such as Citizen Tears.  Once the Utility Belt showed up, she used the goggles and a Micro-Computer aided Razor Ordnance to hit Dawn each turn.  Combat Stance played a role in keeping damaging citizens and environment cards in check.  She also used Grappling Hook twice on pesky ongoings; keeping Dawn&#039;s various ongoings in check is also a key to fighting her, I think.

In the final round, AZ could have finished Dawn off, but instead simply healed himself to improve the final challenge score, leaving Wraith to effect the coup de grace.  Even though Dawn had just 3 HP remaining, she played Inventory Barrage to do 12 damage, just &#039;cause.

[b]Citizen Dawn[/b] could not get her Auroras out thanks to Wraith&#039;s goggles, and fortunately, she was also not able to get any synergistic pairs of citizens played.  The Infrared Goggles also kept some of the more effective citizens out of play.  Dawn did flip once, but then flipped right back.  She did manage to heal 8 points of damage during the battle thanks to Illuminate the Dawn and Citizen Spring, but Wraith buried that one-shot which heals her for 10.  With her citizens unable to effectively team up, Dawn lost health at a steady rate.  The game would have ended a round earlier but for the last-minute arrival of Citizen Truth; the heroes had to spend another round taking him out before they could finish Dawn off in round 10.

[b]Ruins of Atlantis[/b] was more help than hindrance in this one as it turned out.  All three Krakens were played, but these feasted first on a steady supply of citizens, battering themselves ineffectually against Visionary&#039;s cocoon when no citizens were available.  Two Mystical Defenses also came out, but one helped the heroes as mentioned above when Visionary wrested it&#039;s, uh, &quot;mind.&quot;  Toxic Seaweed showed up twice as did Leaking Room.  Fortunately, both of the latter appeared late enough in the battle so that the heroes could continue doing damage using the various powers at their disposal even if they couldn&#039;t play cards.

While this was one of the more frustrating challenges, it was a fun one to try to solve.  After five defeats, I wasn&#039;t sure that I&#039;d picked the right hero in Visionary, but she proved her worth in this battle.  And the repeated plays also forced me to learn how to play Absolute Zero.  He&#039;s not a hero I&#039;d choose to play on my own very often because he takes so long to get set up.  He operates with a different paradigm from most of the other heroes in the game, but I came to appreciate how powerful he can be once he gets his stuff out.</body>

	<body>[size=18][b]Origin Story[/b][/size]

[b]What brought you here?[/b]
I can&#039;t even remember how I found this place.  Probably cruising the &#039;Geeklist&#039; section of the &#039;geek front page, or else I was looking at a particular game and looked for &#039;active&#039; on the geeklist section of the game page.  Something like that.

[b]What was the first game you posted?[/b]
See game listed for this geeklist item.

[b]Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
Yes, and yes.  Just played it today so it would match up with my secret origins&#039; post.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
Maybe not the 1st visit [i]per se[/i], but once you start following SGoYT, you start to see the same games over and over and THAT leads to (see 2 questions down).

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
Camaraderie, learning about new games I might want to acquire, posting my own plays, the contests. 

...and this is a big point--&gt; it might seem counter intuitive, but spending time HERE makes me play more games.  Yah, I spend an hour or so here, but then I get all amped to play something.  Web surfing something like www.si.com doesn&#039;t get me playing games more often.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]

This is the wrong way to frame the question.  The right way to frame the question is:

[b]How many time have your friends at SGoYT helped you to make an informed decision on a cool new game?[/b]
Glad you asked.  After seeing and reading all the hype on these games here, I have acquired [thing=71721][/thing], [thing=29603][/thing], [thing=41490][/thing], and [thing=68876][/thing]. 

[b]ADDITION[/b]: Looks like SGoYT has convinced me to acquire [thing=39941][/thing] as well.

Now that you&#039;ve heard about my SGoYT origin, let&#039;s talk about WMTtE.  I always play for military victory.  Knocked out the Brits.  Had Mac and Nimitz on their last spaces, but couldn&#039;t get the DRMs to get rid of them, too.  When you go for knock out something else has to give, and in my case it was resources.  All 3 went to 0 on the 1st card in the Late War deck.

	<body>It&#039;s only the 9th and we&#039;re off to an amazing start for solitaire games this month!


We&#039;re looking at:

Pathfinder Runelords: 8 plays- 2 to finish off my last campaign with Ezren/Seelah, and 6 so far with my new team of fatales: The druid, barbarian, and sorcerer. Great team so far! 3 characters makes a HUGE difference vs. 2 characters.

Sentinels of the Multiverse: Only 1 play so far this month, but that will change in the next couple weeks as I gear up the next Rook City challenge for my month sentinels challenge thread!

D-Day Dice: 1 solo play on map 14. Lost horribly. STUPID FEW GOOD MEN!!!!!

Dungeon Roll: Looking for something super quick, cranked out 2 plays. Score of 20 with the Spellsword, 32 with the Guild Leader. Wonder who is a better character in general?


Thunderbolt Apache Leader: 2 plays. Iraq show of force. Had a score of 27 or great with no losses. A ton of fun!

Second play saw me barely escape losing 2 planes in 1 mission but taking on Libya 2011 with a total victory during the 4 day scenario. I took out all 8 battalions I drew.



I&#039;ve also just completed a trade and will be getting Thunderbolt Apache Leader and Dawn of the Zeds, so more solo games to enjoy! Plus, my birthday is this month too so.... More games!


MORE GAMES!!!!!</body>

I have all the non kickstarter maps so I think I have a total of 20. And zi finished my first campaign and restarted the next. Want to get going on skull and shackles but the wife wants to play it with me so I went back to this one. I would find it basically impossible to run 2 campaigns out of the same pathfinder box unfortunately.

Ah right, S&amp;S.  That&#039;s probably the best reason to get S&amp;S - one box for solo play, another for the group campaign!  I&#039;m not sure i&#039;m continuing on with S&amp;S though.

I only snagged it because it was on the Black Friday sale at csi. Unless something looks super awesome like iron gods I a. Done getting new pathfinders.

i am still waiting for my copy. :cry: fedex lost it, and it is taking quite some time getting the replacement.  I&#039;ll let you know once i get it!

you will presumably have to get the rest of the s&amp;s scenario expansions, though?

Ah that is most unfortunate! And my csi order that was waiting for gates of arkham just arrived with scenarios 3-5 for s and s and I have 6 on order by itself just waiting for it to Arrive! It&#039;s not a bad investment in my mind. I played runelords once and am going through it again so that&#039;s great. Be about 70 games across everything there. And I like the theme of d ands. After this I am done unless they come out with iron gods or I can get a sweet deal on a complete set. I have enough samey games here to last me for a long time.

How did they lose your package?

good question.  They don&#039;t seem to know either.  All that tracking and barcoding, and then it suddenly stopped being tracked.  Like a blip in Aliens that suddenly stops blipping.

	<body>Finally, fulfilling a promise to myself, this month, to get this wonderful beast back on the table. Embarrassingly, it&#039;s been so long that I&#039;m playing the training scenario, once more, as a refresher. Volkare will be breathing a sigh of relief for another day or two (which is how long I&#039;ll be able to leave this on the table, this time). 

Going to try to get a first play with Krang, this week, too. 

And, this weekend, I&#039;m pulling out [thing=22][/thing].

	<body>Oh wow, haven&#039;t played Hunters since [b]LAST JUNE[/b].  This is still the game that I have put on the SGoYT list the most-- I listed this for 8 straight months when it came out.

On to today.  I am the host for the Hunters [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/18211721#18211721][B]You Only Die Once[/B] challenge.[/url]

Only sinkings at close range ON THE SURFACE count.  Very nasty.  I am not playing in the challenge, but I thought I&#039;d try it out to see how it plays.

So far, 6 patrols, all in British Isles. Some numbers:

1 Abwehr agent delivery
1 Unsuccessful patrol 
1 Doctore SW, later KIA on patrol
1 LI rated [i]Experte[/i]
1 ship sunk at long range, wouldn&#039;t count for challenge
2 air attacks, damaged but escaped
2 hull damage boxes in air attack
6 ships for 32.800 tonnes put under so far

	<body>Ah, so now I see why this game pops up on this list so much -- so addictive. That is, if you like getting beaten into a pulp. It&#039;s a fun beating though, with the promise of maybe, just maybe, winning the next one.

I&#039;m not a very experienced player having just 6 plays under my belt, and those interspersed over the past 6 years, so I had to relearn the game and then learn the AI. It was a little painful for a bit. The whole Consume action was hanging me up, but I think I got it -- unless you choose Consume: Trade yourself, you can&#039;t sell, but you can (and must actually) trade for VPs even if you didn&#039;t choose the action (assuming you have a card that allows you). 

So, assuming I played correctly, the bot kicked my butt good and hard, 5 games to 0. I got as close as 48-42 but was frequently 10+ points lower. Still, this is exactly what I wanted it to be -- a training ground for me to catch up to my friends who know the game well so I can play better from now on. 

And now that I have a copy of the game, it&#039;s more likely to come out on game night. I&#039;d sort of avoided the game only by virtue of the fact that my friends and I were all in on [thing=19857][/thing] rather than try to split our plays between the two games. I know that one the way some know this one. Lately, though, I find myself interested in playing this both m-p and solo. I look forward to more practice sessions of this one.

I was surprised at how addictive it feels. [i]Just one more game![/i] But I got tired and decided to retire to the couch with all of you on my lap. 

Now, don&#039;t get weird about that. :D</body>

[c]+59, Monsters (11)
 +8, Treasures (2)

-80, Dungeon Tax[/c]

Man, this game is so fun!  It&#039;s a mix of tile-laying goodness and a solitaire tableau.  The joy of building your dungeon and seeing it completed is so satisfying.

And then you get hit with the Dungeon Tax.   :shake:

I randomly drew the Thief and the Prophetess this time around.  The Thief can move 1 or 2 spaces and can avoid Monsters without discarding.  The Prophetess can look at the top four cards of the deck, choose one to play, and move the rest to the bottom.

The Ladies were fighting machines, slaying Monsters all through the dungeon.  They took down the big 7 and 9 strength Monsters, a couple of Enchanted Monsters, and even a Double Monster.

[ImageID=2409585medium]

For Treasures, they went with Potions for the first half of the adventure, putting to good use the Speed, Deja Vu, and Reprise spells.  Although, they should have waiting a little longer to cast the Reprise spell.  It refills the dungeon with Monsters and Treasures, and the bottom of the deck was stacked with some juicy rewards they could have grabbed on the way out.

No matter, though.  The construction and ensuing adventure were great fun.  If you&#039;re looking for something to use that ArtsCow coupon on, give this one a gander.

2015 WRC Sweden ES1 snow tires

Love the use of snow tires and double down shifting.

4(4):3(3):3(5):5(6):5(5):5(5):5(5):5(5):5(4)

2:20 - 0:42 = 1:38 with 9 cards

2015 WRC Sweden ES2 snow tires

Love the use of snow tires and double down shifting. SISU needed right at the start. Started getting worried about running out of luck.

2015 WRC Sweden ES3 snow tires

Love the use of snow tires and double down shifting. This one was a lot trickier due to the tight turns at the end. Since I had used up my SISU card already, I gave up a lot of seconds to not crash double downshifting at the end.

	<body>What a fun little game this turned out to be!

I was skeptical after seeing only 2 pages of rules, but I enjoyed this game more than any game I&#039;ve played in a long time.   I was on the edge of my seat at several points during the game.   Real decisions had to be made.   The degree of historical background is outstanding, more than I&#039;ve seen for any wargame.  It&#039;s wonderfully compact and portable, and takes no time to setup and play.

My only criticism is that the element of luck is very high.   Also, it&#039;s unclear if the novelty will wear off with further play.

I&#039;ve alread ordered the expansion!</body>

For me [thing=70519][/thing] is the best hands down.  Each one brings a little different flavor and story and history (if not Zombies).  [thing=66080][/thing] is a pretty good Civil War based one. 

[thing=149361][/thing] and [thing=84465][/thing] are also supposed to be good and can be played separated or simultaneously for a mega game.  I&#039;ve never played these yet, but hope to one day.

If you&#039;re looking for a peaceful game of hand management, goals management, and the occasional poison mushrooms, this is a really great game and a great SoloPlay variant. There is tension, but for some reason it&#039;s not really pressing like it is in, say, Viticulture or Core Worlds SoloPlay. 

In some ways the SoloPlay variant (as it usually does) balances out some issues in the multiplayer game. For instance, spending mushrooms to buy walking sticks isn&#039;t as valuable in the multiplayer game as it is in the SoloPlay variant, where reducing the sticks unbought is important to game scoring. 

And when you do play it two-player, it is a nice walk through the woods gathering mushrooms.

[thread=1282189][/thread]

I was fortunate in patches and ended up with 32 points. Sometimes I did try to control the reaction of the AI. I&#039;ll try the &quot;Patchwork King&quot; variant next in its three stages. 

A final patchwork quilt. It&#039;s very fine, if I do say so myself.

Amazing we got two games on such a theme this year. 

For a game I&#039;m designing I came up with this awesome time based track so players who take longer actions allow the other players more time on their turn. 

Then find out Uwe&#039;s done that here too.

For a game I&#039;m designing I came up with this awesome time based track so players who take longer actions allow the other players more time on their turn. 

Then find out Uwe&#039;s done that here too. 

Now I&#039;ll be called a copycat, lol![/q]

Doesn&#039;y [thing=92319]Olympos [/thing] do that already?[/q]

Never heard of that game, but ok good... better that it&#039;s not a mega unique mechanic then :)

Actually I came up with it for myself 20 years ago in my design for a computer baseball game.  It would have the other games quickly play out the same number of at bats the player&#039;s game had had to advance the out of town scoreboard in a realistic fashion.

	<body>second try this month! - and this time it worked:

i was very lucky with the planet distribution: lots of them close to home so i could spend the first few turns expanding and building colony ships.

in additon to that my miners kept getting minerals home and even discovered alien technology which happenend to be advanced attack technology  - very helpful later on!

and all doomsday machines more or less appeared in the same spot - so my fleet was already there awaiting the next one, with all of my close to home planets still being able to churn out new ships.



Coincidentally the final battle was over Essen again: 

[imageid=2409753 medium]




Thanks to last minute built Battleships my fleet was able to defeat the machnine:

maybe next time iÂ´ll start the alien scenario - although it seemed quite difficult to understand from the first read through..

and by the way: what kind of counter clippers would you recommend..?</body>

I was very skeptical of spending the price of a game on an over designed corner clipper that could be used to bludgeon your opponents to death, but then I broke down and purchased it anyway. I&#039;m sooooo glad I did! I&#039;ve used it on several games and I would buy another one if mine came up missing. 

I purchased the 2mm, but wished I had went for the 2.5mm. Just do it, it&#039;s worth every penny.

why donÂ´t you like the 2mm? i would have thought that the smaller the corners, the better (to not loose to much of the artwork like coloured squares on the back of space empiresÂ´ counters) ?

Having just bought CoA&#039;s Legion of Honor, where the counters have information that go right to their edge, I&#039;m glad I opted for the 2 mm.  I think the 2.5 mm would have clipped off some of the info.

Doubt it. It just gives a nicer curve really. The difference isn&#039;t that great in terms of debris removed. But I don&#039;t think if I had one I&#039;d dump it for the other. 

And bad design to go right to the edge. From graphic design and production standpoint. No bleed area.

	<body>Am I completely insane to play an 18xx game solo? Can 18xx even be enjoyed solitaire?

Yes and No.

After a hiatus from the 18xx system, I&#039;ll soon be teaching a group of players (old and new) 18NEBraska so I decided to put it on the solo table tonight in order to experience the design. Private companies were randomly dealt, and my goal was to operate each corporation as efficiently as possible.

[center][IMG]http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l32/sacentaur/8e20e0dc-c617-43fc-bf96-eb357bc095aa_zps47287692.jpg[/IMG][size=7][i]At start, 3P setup[/i][/size][/center]

I aborted play before the permanent trains appeared as the tipping point had been reached and it was just too much for me to comfortably handle (alas, I found myself making quite a few mistakes).

But it was definitely worth the time and effort - this was a comparatively easy 18xx title to re-familiarize myself with, and I was able to explore many of the ins-and-outs of the design. One thing learned is that there is potential for a high screwage factor (strategy) here when Towns are upgraded to Cities and are then tokened by other railroads. Sweet!

18xx is not generally recommended for solitaire play, but tonight&#039;s action temporarily satiated my train craving and it also fully prepared me for the teaching sessions ahead. Mission accomplished...

I must conclude with the thought that 18xx is one of the finest gaming systems ever created - I simply love it.</body>

I still have the old 1986 Avalon Hill PC version of 1830, and break it out every now and then to play.  It was a pretty successful port of the game, and I&#039;m surprised no one has tried to update it.  I see copies are still for sale on Amazon.

I have never played an 18xx game but they have always intrigued me. I am not quite sure why though.

This system seems like you would need to find dedicated players to really enjoy...grognards if you will. Finding that group of players is easier said than done, for me at least.

Played my first f2f game of 18xx last Saturday. Four players on 1825 Unit 2. Also approaching the end of my first pbem of 18AL.
So far I&#039;m 2 for 2 on horrible losses and braindead decisionmaking. But had fun with the f2f game.

I played it a ton back in the day, and this was actually my introduction to 18xx - they did a nice job on the programming for this one.

Just a quick follow-up, we did hold a 4P session at a local Con this past weekend. My solo play definitely helped in teaching the game.

The session ran a bit long, and near the end the comparatively small map was full so our routes were pretty much set (we cruised through the last two operating rounds).

There was no train rush as the purchases were fairly steady.

I liked the game quite a bit, the six privates are cool just as are the two late start-up companies (who use rusted trains).

Definitely want to play again, 8/10 for multi-player but just 3/10 for solitaire.

Had a lot of fun with this.  Bumped into an Orc early doors, s/he initially got the better of me but I soon rallied and earned my first gold.  Later on I smashed open a rusty cage to free a merchant who was so grateful showed me the secrets to identifying potions (yeah, there&#039;s not much to it!).

Things were tripping along nicely and I was very slowly gathering a few things to me but getting weaker all the time.

Getting back to the Mystical Portal on only 1 HP I decided moving to the next level would give me 1 fruit which would be enough for me to rest and heal up and then explore more.  However, on Level 2 I teleported into a Dark Room which not having a lantern meant I had to move immediately, and to move you must discard a card and as it was my last card (cards = HP) I immediately lost.

Some great mechanics (multiple card useage, you weaken yourself to do more actions), decent replayability, small footprint.  Good game.</body>

	<body>My kickstarted copy of this plopped through the door today. (Well actually I had to answer the door to the postman as it was too big to fit through letterbox but the plopping description sounds better).

[imageid=2410098]

It meant that I have finally been inspired to write something this month and that I played this a few times whilst the girls were at school rather than [thing=121921][/thing], which had been my plan.

I had a couple of wins (1 on easy, 1 on normal) but I played the extra action rule wrong completely in the first game and then slightly wrong in the second game.

Played it a third time with all rules correct on normal level and lost.

[imageid=2410096]It had all been going so well.

I really enjoyed the three games of it I played and wish I could have played a few more.  It has simple rules but quite a few exceptions thanks to all the powers of the heroes and villains.  That means the rulebook comes across as a bit lacking but nothing major. Most of the stuff I called on the fly seemed to match up with the official FAQs when I checked them.

It&#039;s not as tiny as it could have been with the region, hero and epic foe cards being quite large for a &#039;tiny&#039; game.  This makes the footprint small but not tiny.

That said, the rules sink in quick, it is a challenge to win (when you play the rules right) and the quality of the components seems good. This will be coming on holiday with me and can fit in my work bag. It was more fun than [thing=158900][/thing] (another recent game I bought about defending) and I prefer the theme of this one too.

The arts quite nice in a cheesy fantasy way too and it fits in the box without loads of extra space.

Finally, I was worried that I wouldn&#039;t like it as my interest in it had fallen since backing it and the last game I crowd funded had disappointed me. My worries were unfounded. 

Despite the completely different nature of the game, this now makes me very excited about having backed [thing=163967][/thing].

[b]Like:[/b]
The challenge, the theme, the size, the fact that I could play it within 5 minutes and play it right within a couple of plays.

[b]Don&#039;t like:[/b]
The wait between backing a game and getting it can make my interest wane. It had with this but within one play I was happy I backed it.
Is it right to be disappointed with the final size of it being too big?</body>

Having the same reaction: I wish it were tinier.  Rahdo made the comment that the original pnp cards were small, and he liked it that way.  I do feel that the game would be better if all the cards were half as big.  Ironically enough, some of the bigger sizes of cards were a stretch goal.

But overall quality is great, and the box is a very nice size - and surely others would have complained about cards being too small if they had gone the small route.

Got mine the other day and have just given it a bash.  Really enjoyed it.  Rulebook not the best but not awful.  I was one turn away from revealing the Epic Foe but my last turn gave me all my actions up front with low health and two destroyed regions - it wasn&#039;t pretty.

However, I didn&#039;t realise this:
&quot;Does a Group Ally Card automatically trigger the &quot;Rest&quot; ability for all players in the Capital City?
No. In order to trigger the &quot;Rest&quot; ability on a turn from a Group Ally Card, a player must 1) have already been in the Capital City at the beginning of the turn and 2) use at least 1 Action Point.&quot;

That might have helped a couple of times.

What did I change? Most important, the DMs entered correctly. ;) Did I win? No. But first things first.

What did I learn? Even if your colony ship could get into a hex with an unexplored marker - don&#039;t do it! Happened to me yesterday, happened to me today...

[ImageID=2410219]

I took my time getting better technologies and building colony ships before I build myself a good fleet. My scouts were all over the galaxy only to end in dangerous areas. Anyway I found a lot of minerals and planets because of them. They will not be forgotten!

When the first DM entered the map I had a decent fleet to face it.

[ImageID=2410220]

The first attack of the DM was a laugh.

[ImageID=2410221]

I took the thing down but lost some ships too. To score 6 hits is not that easy if the dice hate you.

Finally I got the technology to build my first DN! YES! The second DM was on the map and this was a real killing machine! My last fleet was good (looking), at least that&#039;s what I thought. I rolled 3 hits with every attack the DM did and it destroyed my fleet without a problem.

[ImageID=2410222]

DM 2 was a killing machine!

DM 3 entered the map. My last DN was no match for DM 2 and my HS was terminated.

Damn! If the dice were on my side I would have crushed that second DM! Next time I need to research more attack and defense tech!

:thumbsup: I am already addicted to this game.
:thumbsup: I love that it is not an easy game. Ok the dice hate me...
:thumbsup: I am up for new things! Next time I add some new stuff.

:thumbsdown: I won&#039;t be able to bring it back on the table before saturday. :cry:</body>

&quot;Easy&quot; mode again. But this time my loss was caused by miserable dice rolls. I took that first DM down fast, but rolled so bad fighting the second that failure was for sure.

A hint that I&#039;ve found works (at least in multiplayer) is not to spend a ton of time building miners, because after a few turns, they&#039;re largely useless.

The first few turns should be solely occupied by building colony ships, saving money, getting some techs, and scouting the snot out of your home space.

Once you have a few colonies up and running, and some techs research, you can start pounding out the ship to go destroy the enemy.  I haven&#039;t played the DM scenario in quite some time, so I don&#039;t remember what round it comes out on, but you should be able to build a decent fleet by the 7th round (I think that&#039;s when it comes around).

Yes round 7 it is. Followed by 9 and 11. I did it exactly as you just posted. But rolled terrible while fighting the second DM. It took down my strong fleet and after that ate up my second and weaker one too. But I&#039;ll get my revenge!

same here! just managed to build my first 8 ship strong fleet, which although not particularily good at shooting took down the first DM without casulties.. - the amount of luck in my die rolls was a bit embarrassing really..:shake:

If I say this beach is safe to surf, it&#039;s safe to surf ! (Cue Ride of the Valkyries)

There is a random element in how quickly or slowly the clue tokens come out and that impacts on the darkness rolls as well. Plus, I am the worst dice roller this side of the Mekong river....

:D

But I don&#039;t like games to be walkovers anyway, and last time the darkness escaped before finding the second clue so progress is being made.

I finished painting the minis for both core sets this past weekend(more brown please!) and have finally had the chance to get this to the table a few times since. All I can say is that its been a long time since ive played a game that I think about this much between plays. I have even gone so far as to print out the Hexcrawl map and laminate it all nice.

Where this game wins for me is that its the perfect balance in rules where there is enough to add some depth but not so many that you feel like youre swimming in them and missing things. Sure the first few game took a little while to get through but I am cruising at this point. Really happy with this game.

Also, as nice as the CD is ive preferred some Townes Van Zandt so all my characters play sad and drunk.

My paints were getting a bit low so I bought a large collection and citadel storage box on ebay. Not cheap but a fraction of retail cost.

Am going to start painting these suckers today... Or at least the suckers on these suckers

Thumbs up for the Townes van Zandt reference.

The desert&#039;s quiet, and Brimstone&#039;s cold
And so the story ends we&#039;re told.

Re painting, my target entry into it keeps shifting, from Myth, to Shadows of Brimstone, and now to Star Wars: Imperial Assault.  Since I&#039;m starting a SW:IA campaign this weekend with a buddy, that&#039;s probably where I should start.

I am inspired by this excellent set of videos (link to full series below):

choosing how many chars to play in this game is a strategy decision in itself!  Really cool how it scales like that and makes you take a different approach.  Though I found 2 chars to be much tougher than 3 or 4.

	<body>And [thing=151310][/thing]

Tonight, after watching the season finale of Fargo, i am going to play both back to back.
After having played a lot thematic games with miniatures, I am going to pull these more abstract games out.

While not overly thematic, I LOOOOVE these Knizia games, that give just enough depth and just that right amount of strategy without being overwhelming.

	<body>[size=18][b]Origin Story[/b][/size]

[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/b]
I got a GeekMail invitation from someone, so I thought I&#039;d check it out.

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
Hmm ... maybe [thing=28829][/thing] or [thing=71721][/thing]. Not sure anymore. I still own both, but I haven&#039;t played either in a long while.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I was overwhelmed by the size of the guild and of this regular GeekList. I had a reputation as a solo guy long before SGoYT came along, but I was under the impression that I was in a tiny minority. Hardly any other BGGeeks seemed much interested.

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]
I got off on the wrong foot by immediately suggesting that this list could stand to be broken down into a weekly thing so as not to grow so big and unmanageable. Didn&#039;t mean to complain or anything; I just wasn&#039;t used to the information overload (or the fun &quot;block party&quot; as someone else called it).

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
My subscription notice. Frankly, I often skip this list, or check in only now and then, because it&#039;s too much for me to keep up with.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
&quot;These lists?&quot; OMG, don&#039;t tell me there&#039;s more than one! :surprise:

Oh, maybe you mean one per month. (Whew!)

I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve cost me any money; only time. Well, except that I kept seeing Mage Knight praised around here, so I put it on a wish list, and my wife bought it for me last Christmas.

Aside from that, I&#039;ve been spending most of my money at GOG.com on non-tabletop games.

[b]If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?[/b]
Hmm ... maybe I&#039;m not. Could be I&#039;m just imagining it. Or maybe this is still part of my first visit, and I&#039;ve never really left. Or there could be some kind of multidimensional thing going on. But most likely, I have been back, so here I am.


[size=18][b]Game Rating[/b][/size]
Just noticed the game-rating bit in the header. I&#039;m new to Mage Knight, but ...

:thumbsup: A wonderfully variable, challenging puzzle of a game, with great components and a built-in solitaire version.

:thumbsdown: Deceptive, in that at first glance it appears to be an RPG/Adventure game; not very engaging imaginatively/emotionally.

:thumbsdown: A brain-buster; one of those games (like chess) where you do a whole lot of thinking before you make a move. (Of course, that&#039;s a thumbs-up for anyone who loves that sort of thing.)

The last few hours have been a bit of a blur, but the solo conquests were fantastically rewarding. I was still using the dummy player as a timer, as I&#039;ve always enjoyed the simplicity of it. I&#039;m getting to the point where not every game is a learning one, but I want to get another half-dozen plays under my belt before attempting to add in Volkare again. (I&#039;ve made the mistake of over-complicating a base game, without knowing it intimately enough, before.) 

Krang seems great, but I&#039;ve also realised there are two characters in the base game I haven&#039;t tackled yet. Must fix that.

I have had sooo much fun from this game and haven&#039;t even tried the Krang scenarios yet.

I&#039;m just getting back to this game too after a 7 month hiatus.  I&#039;m happy to say that I feel right back on track after going through the walk through again.  I just completed the [geekurl=/article/18295702#18295702]Draconum Infestation Challenge[/geekurl].  It was a nice change from Conquest.

	<body>I just finished my third straight game of this. I think I can say that it doesn&#039;t make the cut. I really wanted to like this game. It&#039;s got dinosaurs, evolution, cataclysmic events. I love all three of those. Sadly, this game isn&#039;t the one for me.

Why it&#039;s getting fired:
1. Rules are not easy to digest. I read the rules, watched Rick Royal&#039;s video, played the game, read the rules, played two more times. I still find myself needing to consult the RULES! Yes, I have the living rules.

2. Herbivore and carnivore contests, herbivores can become carnivores, road runner DNA, dentition, size....it&#039;s just too much that is not implemented in an easy to understand way.

3. It seems as though the DNA I need is never in the display. Most of the early biomes require BB and I could never get BB or even a single B.

Me: &quot;BIOS: Megafauna, I&#039;m sorry. I wanted to like you, honestly. It&#039;s not you, it&#039;s me....good-bye&quot;</body>

I enjoy [b]Bios:M[/b] a lot, though it hasn&#039;t been to the table in recent memory due to the constant rules issues that you already mention (not nearly as grievous as High Frontier, however).

Still, I think it&#039;s a near-brilliant design and we have a full table session scheduled for a convention this weekend.

I&#039;ve been playing a variant of this game for over 15 years.  It started out as [thing=639][/thing], then became a better-looking AM 2nd edition, then added an expansion, and finally morphed into [thing=97915][/thing].

I have to say I like AM 2nd edition more than BIOS, as I think they took a lot of the Eklund-esque quirkiness out of the latter version.  I played AF solo by rolling the dice to determine bidding when needed.  The game was so cool it was fun just watching the titanic struggle ensue, without regard to who won. 

I was introduced to the game by this great review, http://www.panix.com/~sos/bc/amf.html, which has a variant I used for AM2.

Chris, 

I was hoping that the &quot;story&quot; would eclipse the gameplay. Unfortunately, for me, The story was lost in the fog of rules checking, herbivore requirements, carnivore contests, and turn after turn of not being able to get any usable DNA.

Maybe this one is better played against actual people.

I&#039;ve only ever played it multiplayer solitaire. I looked at the solo rules and just got turned off by all the nuts and bolts added. So I skipped them.

Well, I was going to ask that if you planned on trading it, if there was anything on my trade list you&#039;d be interested in, but now after seeing this discussion, I&#039;m wondering if I should just take it off my wishlist.

	<body>Inspired by Marco&#039;s recent video review of Cruel Necessity, I decided I was long overdue in getting this to the table again.

As it turned out, the last time I played this was 18th February 2014, and I had played the 1st English Civil War in my 5th Campaign. I was on -6VP after that.

I re-read Wes Erni&#039;s strategy tips, and felt ready for the fray once again, so onwards in this session with the 2nd ECW!
The highlights of the 2nd ECW were the 3 battle victories. They provided me with a little comfort and zeal, but that was all. I made little progress and finished the 2nd ECW on -9VP.

The position going into the 3rd ECW was fairly dire. The Battle of Worcester was fought as a decisive battle, and this again provided me with much needed zeal. However, my dice rolls failed to inspire for much of the game.

I barely managed to survive to card No.60, the end of the 3rd ECW, finishing with -11VP. Surviving counts as a victory, but the points edges the victory into &#039;marginal defeat&#039; territory. Once again, I just could not manage to obtain an achievement card! When a card appeared to be within reach, the political track moved me out of reach.

:thumbsup:  I love this game :) - it&#039;s a lavish VPG States of Siege game with high production quality, beautiful map, and so many moving parts.

:thumbsdown:  I hate this game..... :) I cannot seem to crack it and achieve any kind of worthwhile victory. I seem to be getting worse at it, not better! My last three campaign scores are -6VP, -9 VP, -11VP.

:thumbsup:  It has the Battle of Worcester :) - I live only ten miles from the site of the Battle of Worcester!</body>

I worked quite a bit with John Welch on this while it inexplicably languished in limbo at VPG for several years.

The prototype was a ton of fun, but there were some unfortunate issues (all initiated by VPG) that prevented it from being published by GMT (in the proposed Revolt &amp; Revolution pack that had to be cancelled).

Still, the final production turned out nicely but the game would have garnished more attention (and many more accolades) if it had been released by GMT - I feel bad for the designer who put his heart &amp; soul into the project, he truly deserved a lot more success than he actually received.

Having spent years in the trenches, few people realize that our cherished hobby puts creative talent at great risk, just like in movies, TV, books, etc. Just the way it is.

It is fair to say that John Welch has produced a marvelous game design, which provides a great insight into the history of the ECWs. It ought to have won an award, really. :D

It is a very tough nut to crack too, though I am probably not a good enough player (or my dice are not loaded in my favour!) to really get the most from the game!

	<body>Ok - so another solo game night and here&#039;s what I played:

[b]Euphoria [/b]- LOVE this game.  I stupidly backed out of the KS and had to acquire the Deluxe edition via trade, but now that I have it I&#039;m psyched.  There&#039;s a good solo play variant on BGG that keeps the general feel of the game, but I wanted to play 2-handed tonight, and in the end there was only 1 move difference between losing and winning - a very tight game.

[b]BIOS Megafauna[/b] - This was a recent acquisition after watching Ricky Royal (sidebar - every time I watch his videos I buy the game - seriously I&#039;ve got 90% of the games that I&#039;ve seen on his channel).  This was my second play of it, and I liked it better than the first.  I saw another SGOYTer post tonight about never getting the cards in the display, and that happened to me for part of the game tonight, but still managed to pull out an 11 to 9 win.  I&#039;m going to remove the advanced cards since the AI can&#039;t buy them - I&#039;m sure that will add some additional stress to the game.

[b]Shadows over the Empire[/b] - After perusing my shelves, this was collecting dust and was on my &quot;trade&quot; pile, so I gave it another shot.  It&#039;s not made for solo play, but since I was playing 2-handed earlier I thought it was fine.  In general the gameplay consists of influencing cards, and using abilities - but there&#039;s quite a bit going on in a small display for 2 players ( I can&#039;t imagine a 4 player game). Overall, I like the artwork, and feel that it&#039;s an ok game, but when shelf space is a concern, it&#039;s probably headed out the door.</body>

In reference to BIOS:

I was using the &quot;genome&quot; cards and at one time most of my display was filled with them. I was also using the double display, two rows of five. That could have been part of the problem. 

I am glad you like the game. For me it is frustrating.

	<body>Had a great run with Kyra, Valeros, and Ezren killing more undead in the 2nd part of the 2nd scenario.

Closed a couple locations real quickly, which helped them corner the villain swiftly.

Valeros broke open a chest and found 3 magical weapons. It became quite a debate for Ezren. Valeros offered Ezren a magical dagger and a magical straight razor. Both were better than the stick he&#039;s been carrying, but the dagger uses Dexterity, while the Razor uses Strength.

[IMG]http://www.buschfineartstudios.com/files/images/web2straightrazoredit.preview.jpg[/IMG]

Ezren can level up his Dex, 3 times, but his Str only once. He decided on the Razor though. The team has more Combat Strength blessings, and the Razor can add 3d4+1 rather than just 2d4+1. Besides, who doesn&#039;t want a magical razor.

	<body>Played for the first time tonight.  Won the first round (Normal difficulty) fairly easily, and then realized I&#039;d messed up the rule for assessing penalties when you haven&#039;t filled in your &quot;defend&quot; side of the card.  Played again and lost on the final card.  Fun, quick game.

For a solo game that plays in 20 minutes, I think it has a nice niche in my collection.  It works great multiplayer too.

	<body>Harsk, Amiri, and Ezren are back at it again facing the Stone Giants attacking Sandpoint.

I continue to be impressed by the small thematic touches in this game. This scenario has you roll for an open location each turn and reveal the top card. If it&#039;s a boon (good), you put it back in the box. If it&#039;s a bane (bad), you shuffle it back into the deck. Seemed like a bunch of stone giants were raging around the city slowly destroying everything in their path. Cool.

The fight itself was a pretty simple one. Find enemies. Kill enemies. The good guys won, taking out Teraktinus in the final location they ventured to.

The only other thing I must bring up is a beef I have with one Kev Cossley (I think that&#039;s the right name) who drew the artwork for the Deathweb monster.

[imageid=2410853 medium]

Seriously Kev... I have enough spider nightmares without you putting this horrifying image of a zombie spider in my head. Of course, you would probably take that as a compliment. :shake:</body>

	<body>[b]Origin Story[/b]

I found the list just by noticing it as a regular on the active geeklists.   As I started to play more solo games, I got curious and checked it out.  This was the first solo game I posted to this list back in August 2014.  The two games I can immediately think of that this list was instrumental in me buying were D-Day Dice (it&#039;s ok) and Navajo Wars (solid game).

I keep coming back just to see what others are playing so I can gather ideas on other things I might be interested in picking up.  I also like any solo variants for any games that aren&#039;t normally considered solo games.</body>

Still did better than in the past with the Las Villas firewall strategy, but could keep the insurgents under control.   Either Directorio or Syndicate could have won, it was up to Castro on his final turn to decide (he could either close the 8th casino or place enough guerillas to rest control away from the key Directorio population area).  As I was the government, I didn&#039;t really care. </body>

	<body>It&#039;s been quite a while since I last posted to SGoyT and that&#039;s partly down to the fact that I&#039;ve not been playing an awful lot of solo games, just the odd evening here and there but also just down to the fact that I&#039;ve been really lazy. ;)

Anyway, decided to make a bit more of an effort so here&#039;s a few posts of games I played yesterday.

First up was Euphoria using this [filepage=108724]solo variant[/filepage], written by [user=MrTetsuo][/user]

It was my first play using the variant and I&#039;ve only played a couple of learning games of Euphoria before that.  Needless to say, I didn&#039;t achieve the full victory condition, I took the easier victory condidtion and used my dilema card to place my last star.  I quite enjoyed the variant, it&#039;s quite a nice little sandbox to play around with Euphoria&#039;s optimisation puzzle.  I might have the opportunity to break Euphoria out tonight for a multiplayer game, so it&#039;ll be interesting to see how it compares.</body>

	<body>Viticulture was next up (staying on a theme) - there&#039;s been a ton of posts on this recently and even after just a couple of games I can really see why.  It&#039;s just so smooth and easy to play, yet challenging and for me, has that right level of thinky-ness.

I managed to pull off a semi-win in this one, technically I hit the victory point total but there was one winter when I forgot to apply the automa and it was halfway through the next turn before I realised.  I tried to handicap myself a bit to make up for it but really there was no telling just how much difference that made.  So I&#039;m not considering that one an official win for the campaign, just a good learning game. </body>

	<body>This was the last game I had time for and was the second play of the game.  My first game ended fairly violently with a Chestburster emerging after I was unable to deal with a Facehugger early in the game.  Happily, the second game was much more successful and I pulled off a fairly easy victory.  There&#039;s a lot I really like in this game, most of the art is great, I love the mechanism for building the Hive deck and the way it works with the objectives, I like the scanning and some of the enemies are really cool.  Yet I can&#039;t help but feel it&#039;s got some massive problems when played with 1 player.  There was very little tension in the game I played yesterday and the use of the Coordinate mechanic seems to be fairly integral to the game at times, losing that when playing 1 handed really took the shine off, imo.  These are all things (from what I&#039;ve read) that can be fixed by playing multi-handed (which I have no problem with), so I think, for me (rather than tinkering with house rules) that&#039;s the way to go in the future. </body>

	<body>For reasons that will become clear in time, I&#039;m trying to get more plays of this game in in the near future. I tried my first play of the Alien 3 (Fury colony) scenario today.

Wow! I had remembered the other scenarios being a bit soft for 3 players, but this one really ramped up the combat difficulty. I played with the Priest, Executive and Commander avatars. My Priest died before Objective 2. As I understand it, this actually helped me a little bit by giving the other characters more opportunities to cycle their decks. Still, this one definitely puts a heavy emphasis on combat, even more so than the Aliens scenario, with a lot of really nasty enemies. The Beast, the final boss of this scenario, is particularly nasty in a way that I won&#039;t spoil for anybody. In a nice thematic moment, I finished him off with the Lead Works.

I have also been playing through the tutorial of [b][thing=102435][/thing][/b]. I believe that where I left off last night, I had just used my first Ceremony card. I really appreciate the time that went into making this tutorial--without it, I bet I would understand the rules of the game, but I would have no clue what kind of strategies to pursue.

I was surprised to get a shipping confirmation from CoolStuffInc for my order of [b][thing=163602][/thing][/b], [b][thing=34119][/thing][/b] and [b][thing=166679][/thing][/b]! Looks like I have a lot of gaming in my future. Good timing, too, because my wife just started the spring semester and will be busy studying more often than not, leaving me more solo gaming time.

In a non-gaming related but happy life event, I had a job interview today that I think went pretty well. Hopefully something comes of it.

Finally, I&#039;m playing a game this week that, while I&#039;m playing it solo, I&#039;m not at liberty to describe the game in any way, even the theme or publisher. I will say that I think it will please some members of this guild. If things go as I expect, you probably won&#039;t hear much from me for the rest of the week.</body>

That would imply a joke. This is deadly serious!

The job I mentioned in the OP called today, and looks like I&#039;ll be starting training next week. This is a big thing for us--we&#039;ve been living on the sporadic paychecks of my freelance work, so a steady job is huge.

Even if that were true, I couldn&#039;t confirm or deny it.

Aargh, I just realized something: I dropped my ipad last week and broke the screen. Took it to a repair place and they managed to break it further--we&#039;re still waiting on replacement parts to come in. That means I might get the XCOM board game before I get my iPad back, so I&#039;ll need to wait [u]A DAY OR LONGER[/u] to play it!

Hmm.

I&#039;m going to guess what it is.

Looking through your ratings you seem to like thematic games.

So I am going to guess that this is a game about button making in the 1700s.  Its a Euro Game where you have to use an intricate time system to punch holes in your buttons faster than your opponents.

The sequel or expansion will task you with sewing those buttons onto a shirt.  Or pants for more points!  

That, or its an intricate simulation about tank tread repair in the winter of 1940 in Russia.

Byron, I hope I didn&#039;t offend you. Reading your reaction to my comment, I&#039;m assuming there is a double-meaning in &quot;punchline&quot; or an irony, I&#039;m simply not aware of... No irony intended. If there is, forgive my French, please.

My comment just meant: 
[q=&quot;koinskyz&quot;]A post full of suspense.[/q] Take it as a compliment. I read it with pleasure and I&#039;d like to know more.
[q=&quot;koinskyz&quot;]Looking forward the punchline...[/q] For me, punchline is what I use to qualify the &quot;end of a story&quot; in a book or a movie, the moment when you&#039;ve got the answers to all the questions. 

I would like to know the result of your job&#039;s interview - and sincerely wish you the best for your training, next week - and also the name of the game you mentioned in your last paragraph. In that matter, Chris did a nice detective&#039;s job... Anyway, the suspense remains and I&#039;m looking forward the [-]punchline[/-] answers... :)

Yes, I figured there was a translation error there. A &quot;punchline&quot; usually means the ending of a joke or funny story.

As Byron said, punchline in English is often used to refer to the end of a joke or humorous story. 

Resolution works for what you intended, I think. Or denomount. 

But no reason to forgive your French. I think we all tend to understand each other, with a miscue somewhere along the way now and then. 

But your English is about 6.8 trillion times better than my French, which is embarrassingly bad and consists of my ability to decipher writing now and then and maybe ask where I could find the library. 

But I took it in high school, and that was 15 years ago.

To follow on what Chris said, I did understand your general meaning and I thank you for the well wishes.

It also amazes me how many people I meet internationally who are essentially fluent in English. I&#039;ve taken 4 years of French and 4 years of Japanese, and as soon as I stopped actively studying them, I forgot everything. I can put together maybe 3 very simple sentences off the top of my head. Je suis dÃ©solÃ© (or is it j&#039;ai dÃ©solÃ©?). :)

@ Byron &quot;Je suis dÃ©solÃ©&quot; is fine. 

French used to be the international language in Europe during the XIXth century. 
No wonder why, English replaced it in the XX th. It&#039;s far more efficient and less complicated (I never know what kind of accent - Ã , Ãª, Ã¨, Ã© ...- I have to use on a word while writing in French and as I noticed when translating Infection, last month, we need several words to express some ideas whereas English uses one or two). 
I wouldn&#039;t learn French myself, too &quot;clumsy&quot;.

@ Chris : &quot;Je suis une bibliothÃ¨que&quot; means &quot;I&#039;m a library&quot; which is pretty .... intriguing :D

That&#039;s common in a lot of other latin based languages.  For some reason when Old English merged with Old French and became Middle English, they just took the most confusing bits of each language. Except the whole gender thing.

[q=&quot;Andreas&quot;]Je ne comprends pas. Je parle un peu de francais seulement. [/q]

Got that too.  Had to look up &quot;seulement&quot; though.  Don&#039;t think I every learned that one in high school French.  Probably a tad too advanced for my 15 year old brain.  That, at the time, could barely grasp the grammar of my native language.

[q=&quot;philmcd&quot;]I still want someone to explain how inanimate objects are either male or female in French?

As Chris said above, itâs linked to Latin roots.

Using different genders has many consequences, though, regarding the interpretation of words and meanings. For instance, âdeathâ is female in French and âmaleâ in German. It made a huge difference in the XIX th century literature which is usually referred to as âthe romantic periodâ. French romantic writers expressed a kind of âlove-fascinationâ relationship with the concept of âla mortâ personifying it as a woman most of the time, whereas Germans romantics were less fascinated by the subject.

We call a boat using the male gender âun bateauâ, âun voilierâ. French were not sailors in their blood. On the contrary, I noticed that English people use a female gender &quot;she&quot; to refer to a boat and not &quot;it&quot; for once. I donât know why but I find it fits well with their insular state and the passion they have ever shown for seas and oceans.

Yeah, ship is the exception to the rule for us and it probably does have it&#039;s roots in naval empire, though it is a figure of speech rather than a grammatical necessity.

BTW I wasn&#039;t criticising the French language, just curious as to how that particular feature occurred.

English is a real mongrel language, with Celt, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, and Latin all contributing to it&#039;s melange.

I would hate to learn English as a foreign language, with many words for the same thing, many words having multiple meanings and many parts of words spelled the same way but pronounced differently. Nearly as bad as learning to write in Mandarin.

I spent a semester in Brussels and still attend a French conversation group to [-]look for hot French-speaking women[/-] keep up with my skills. I do prefer the Belgian way of doing numbers though as the French 60-10 for 70 and 80-10 for 90 has never sunk in with me. Talk about absurd exceptions!

I studied Russian and Greek too, though I only remember a few phrases of each. Russian is a beautiful language, and I wish I&#039;d studied it more. 

Edit: And just to complete the subject: I have a great mind for memorization; have had a near photographic memory all my life and the ability to remember things, especially numbers very, very well. This made me particularly adept at learning languages (and memorize lines when I was an actor). However, that ability seems to have been stolen from my ability to remember things like to take my phone with me when I go back downstairs or that I have plans on a day which I then schedule more plans for (just did this!). Getting scary as I get older.

It&#039;s about kids learning written English, but there&#039;s a part in there about how our written language got so messy.

Some of that is hooey. Middle English didn&#039;t have unified spelling. It&#039;s been a mess for a long time. And it&#039;s because would language is derived from a weird bleeding of stuff, where it&#039;s about 60 percent rooted in French, and 40 percent rooted in germanic root.

Excellent article. Thanks for sharing Mike. 

I guess, one could find similar studies regarding French spelling for some similar reasons (first copyists were also mentioned as responsible for some letters&#039; accents). 
If I get it right, it&#039;s time to learn Finnish: could be the international language of the XXI th century...

[q]We call a boat using the male gender âun bateauâ, âun voilierâ. French were not sailors in their blood. On the contrary, I noticed that English people use a female gender &quot;she&quot; to refer to a boat and not &quot;it&quot; for once. [/q]

[q=&quot;philmcd&quot;]Yeah, ship is the exception to the rule for us and it probably does have it&#039;s roots in naval empire, though it is a figure of speech rather than a grammatical necessity.
[/q]

We need to work on these land lubbery attitudes!

Believe me, calling a ship &#039;she&#039; IS a grammatical necessity, for anyone whose heart has been captured by the sea.

Ok, forget the &quot;excellent&quot; just above. :)
I just read your opinion on the article Chris and learn the word &quot;hooey&quot; at the same time. I&#039;m not a specialist of etymology and language history... 

Should I forget about learning Finnish, then ?

Nyet, tovarisch.  Grammar is unimportant, a ship under sail is important, preferably with your feet on her deck.

[q=&quot;kittenhoarder&quot;][q=&quot;often&quot;]I think koinsky was referring to the last few sentences of your post:

[q]Finally, I&#039;m playing a game this week that, while I&#039;m playing it solo, I&#039;m not at liberty to describe the game in any way, even the theme or publisher. I will say that I think it will please some members of this guild. If things go as I expect, you probably won&#039;t hear much from me for the rest of the week.[/q][/q]

I probably could have phrased my reply better. They were meant to be two unconnected thoughts. In any case, you probably won&#039;t hear more about the mystery game for a while. It&#039;s something unannounced, plays solo, and that&#039;s all I can say. :ninja:[/q]

Sounds like &#039;Mystery Shopper, the Board Game&#039;

Come on, English is many things (because it derives from many diverse sources), but simple it isn&#039;t. It is a very complex language, made doubly obtuse by the various oddball pronunciations of seemingly similar words.

However, it&#039;s complexity has the upside of making it a very expressive language, capable of describing minutaei in a rainbow of textures and colours, each slightly different from the next.

My comment is a bit tongue in cheek to express my frustration at how English not only has inane spelling variations, but even the vowel sounds have been corrupted so the letters don&#039;t match the phonetic symbols. However, there is a bit of truth in what I say - just 700 words  represent 68% of written and verbal English material.

That will be the influence of the tabloid press and texting. When you&#039;ve got 100,000+ words to choose from, why compromise?

Personally I like to use words as a palette.

Well, the stats predate texting and the rise of the tabloid press, and I am talking about everyday usage; for instance, of the 21 words in your sentence &quot;That will be...&quot; 16 of those are from the 700. Of your next sentence only &#039;palette&#039; and &#039;personally&#039; are not from the 700, although &#039;personally&#039; is derived from personal, which is. Both % close to 70%.

The stats pre-date the 1970&#039;s ?? Maybe they are superfluous, out-moded or ambiguous :)

But in any case, the complexity of the English langage is a funtion of it&#039;s grammar, spelling and contextual pronunciation, not the quantity of vocabulary.

I know quite a large number of French and German words, but my French grammar is poor and my German is non-existent.

Being a teacher in Norway and teaching English, the phonetics of English puzzles a lot of kids. In Norwegian the letters usually have only 1 phonetic use, and more of our words phonetically match the letters. And we have 1 word (that I can come up with) that has different meanings depending on how you say it. 

Last week one of my pupils expressed great frustration when he encountered the word &quot;cuddled&quot; and learnt that it is pronounced more like &quot;cudd[i]eld[/i]&quot; &quot;Why can&#039;t English just write how it sounds?&quot; 

Another thing that can further complicate English for us is that school teach British spelling and phonetics, but most computergames and movies the kids encounter have the American spelling and phonetics. 

But in Norway we don&#039;t dub our movies, so kids get lots of exposure to English there. (Some kids shows are dubbed)

That&#039;s the main problem mentioned in that article I linked:

[q]But consider this: English has 205 ways to spell 44 sounds. And not only can the same sounds be represented in different ways, but the same letter or letter combinations can also correspond to different sounds. For example, &quot;cat,&quot; &quot;kangaroo,&quot; &quot;chrome,&quot; and &quot;queue&quot; all start with the same sound, and &quot;eight&quot; and &quot;ate&quot; sound identical. Meanwhile, &quot;it&quot; doesnât sound like the first syllable of &quot;item,&quot; for instance, and &quot;cough&quot; doesnât rhyme with either &quot;enough,&quot; &quot;through,&quot; &quot;furlough&quot; or &quot;bough.&quot; Even some identically spelled words, such as &quot;tear,&quot; can be pronounced differently and mean different things.[/q]

205 ways to write 44 sounds is ridiculous. Even 80 or 100 ways sounds ridiculous; I envy those languages with closer to 1:1 correspondence of spelling to sound.

And having a rich, diverse vocabulary doesn&#039;t necessitate 205 ways to write sounds; we could simplify our spelling and still have the same vocabulary.

That will be the influence of the tabloid press and texting. When you&#039;ve got 100,000+ words to choose from, why compromise?

Personally I like to use words as a palette.[/q]

Well the stats predate texting and the rise of the tabloid press, and I am talking about everyday usage, for instance, of the 21 words in your sentence &quot;That will be...&quot; 16 of those are from the 700. Of your next sentence only &#039;palette&#039; and &#039;personally&#039; are not from the 700, although &#039;personally&#039; is derived from personal, which is. Both % both close to 70%.

[/q]

The stats pre-date the 1970&#039;s ?? Maybe they are superfluous, out-moded or ambiguous :)

But in any case, the complexity of the English langage is a funtion of it&#039;s grammar, spelling and contextual pronunciation, not the quantity of vocabulary.

I know quite a large number of French and German words, but my French grammar is poor and my German is non-existent.

[/q]

Having had to conjugate verbs in French, German and Portuguese I still think English is simpler. In Chinese, apparently, how you intone a word changes its meaning, without the native ear for it, it is very difficult to get the right intonation. In Arabic, the difference in pronunciation is so subtle, when my friend Farah, told people her name they laughed, because her slight difference in pronunciation changed its meaning to &#039;rat&#039;.

I find English is simple in some ways compared to these languages, and very forgiving. It&#039;s amazing how metropolitan English speakers can understand English spoken in a wide range of accents and variants from countries where it is a national second language with very different but accepted ways of using it. 

I know I said this tongue in cheek, but as I said there is a bit of truth in it. 

As for the stats, they aren&#039;t out-moded, as I just used them on a contemporary use of English - yours. Neither are they ambiguous, you can take a sample of modern literature and count the words that are in the list of the common words.  Superfluous? I suppose it depends on what you are trying to use them for. Originally they were used as a way of teaching Pitmans Shorthand. 

I am not saying English is not a beautiful language with a rich vocabulary. I am sure it is popular world-wide for that reason, but its spoken accessibility is also probably part of the reason. It&#039;s just a shame about the spelling/pronunciation mismatch :angry:

Actually, taking 2 lines of my text to try and make a point was a bit limp, but I let it go to try and keep the conversation light. Feel free to use a larger sample if you think it meaningful, just don&#039;t make a &#039;selected&#039; sample.

The true test of complexity is in the experience of those who have to learn it as a foreign language. My conversational experience has been that it is not an easy task.

I am saying the same: that trying to speak and read English is not easy, it is hard, because of the spelling and the vowels not being the same as in most languages using the Latin alphabet. However, it is simpler to learn verb conjugation in English compared to French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German. English doesn&#039;t need you to match the articles and adjectives to the nouns gender. Even changing the order of words in English, like Yoda does in Star Wars, doesn&#039;t make it necessarily unintelligible. 

Don&#039;t you think that makes English a bit simpler to learn as a spoken language only? Lots of people learn to speak English from watching films, listening to songs, not from reading. You can learn to speak a language with no reading. For thousands of years most people were illiterate.

French has nothing to envy to English in terms of written complexity. Note that language is not my specialty, although I&#039;ve studied Latin, Greek, German in middle and high school (ages ago)

Because it went very far away from its Latin&#039;s roots (much more than other Latin languages, I guess), we&#039;ve got so many words with similar pronunciation and different orthography-meanings. Some of them are very common and used in every day life. For instance : &quot;cinq, saint, sain, sein, seing, ceint&quot; = &quot;five, holy, healthy, breast, &quot;signature&quot;, &quot;to put something around the head...&quot;

Then, we&#039;ve got the accents on letters, coming from Greek, which have a common grammatical rule and sooooo many exceptions to the rule. Furthermore, we&#039;ve got numerous letters (mostly consonants) which are written and not pronounced. But, we haven&#039;t got many diphthongs. 

German is incredibly difficult with the declinations (like in Latin and Greek) when the word changes depending on its location-role in the sentence. You have to master grammar when speaking-writing  German. Not a surprise to me to notice that German people are fluent in foreign languages and don&#039;t do many mistakes while writing. They learned how a sentence is built.

English grammar seems much more accessible, IMO. I didn&#039;t, actually, learn English at school, never read a grammar book but I guess I&#039;m fluent while speaking and understandable while writing even if I&#039;m not at ease when I write. I don&#039;t master all the subtilties but I find this language very... Inventive, let&#039;s say poetic and the English thesaurus is a beauty. 

Nevertheless, I&#039;m pretty sure, Steve will not spot any words in my comment which are not among the 700 words list he mentioned above...

Come on, English is many things (because it derives from many diverse sources), but simple it isn&#039;t. It is a very complex language, made doubly obtuse by the various oddball pronunciations of seemingly similar words.

However, it&#039;s complexity has the upside of making it a very expressive language, capable of describing minutaei in a rainbow of textures and colours, each slightly different from the next.

I think we are.

English grammar starts getting complex when you delve into it.  The best part of it is that the &quot;experts&quot; don&#039;t even agree on a lot of the fiddly bits.  The Oxford Comma?  Apostrophe S after words that end with s?  

Then the text generation has ripped apart a lot of the stuff we do.  Sentences end with prepositions all over the place.  There are split infinitives and people don&#039;t bat an eyelash.

I mean, SPLIT INFINITIVES!  Where will it end. :)

Very interesting chat.  Reading through the comments reminded me of the time I was chatting to a mate about the true story film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;. Basically Derek Bentley was hanged for saying &quot;Let him have it Chris&quot; to his mate when a policeman had asked them for the gun they were holding when caught during a burglary.

The informal meaning of &quot;shoot him, Chris&quot; instead of the literal meaning of &quot;give him the gun, Chris&quot; would seem to be an ambiguity that could not exist in probably most other languages (particularly German which we were talking about at the time).

Yes, there is a lot of ambiguity in English. I am always having to get clarity on ambiguous emails sent to me. Sometimes it is quite difficult to be unambiguous in instructions, I wonder if that is why there are so many complaints about rulebooks in English for games?

This is a geeklist about solitaire games. This item is about Aliens. I don&#039;t see Sigourney Weaver trying to kill Aliens with grammatical pulse rifles.

C&#039;mon folks, let&#039;s stop talking about language differences and shooting Chris in the foot and get back on topic.

A grammarian pulse rifle sounds like it&#039;s straight out of Star Wars.

Can we talk about Sigourney Weaver... She was hot in Galaxy Quest. :D

And talking of the hilarious Galaxy Quest has there ever been a better actor than Alan Rickman?

His Spock-mock in Galaxy Quest
His German terrorist gangster in Die Hard 1
His deranged Sherriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of thieves
His romantic lead in Truly Madly Deeply

The man is a genius, he never disappoints. Yes, Jeremy Irons and Daniel Day Lewis are just as good as pure actors, but Rickman picks the marrow out of every part he plays.

To make this post &#039;relevant&#039; I would like to see a boardgame made with a Galaxy Quest theme.

How weird. I just clicked the link above, inside your quote no less; it took me to the video page and immediately after the video started loading it jumped ahead to the 55 second mark.

Edit: maybe it&#039;s not supported in BGG&#039;s youtube linking code.

Reading your answer, I did some tests...

Youâre right, the link works on my browser (Iâm on my computer using firefox, now) It didnât work when I first tried it this morning, but I was on my ipad with opera as a browser. 
Thatâs the reason for my first answer.

I tried it again in an embedded BGG box and it doesnât work, even with my computer. 

Good to know. Thanks again. :)

it&#039;s really frustrating how the different youtube apps behave differently.  PC version on youtube browser site has most features, youtube tablet app doesn&#039;t let you increase playback time but does allow adjusting resolution (which is a requirement for bandwidth management), and youtube embeds don&#039;t have either one.  So i end up finding videos on bgg, but reloading from app to save bandwidth, and if i want to save time, have to wait to see it on pc.  Embeds are probably feature-nerfed in order to drive traffic to their website or app.

Getting back to the language discussion...

Did you know that Spanish is the most intelligible language? 
It was determined by otorhinolaringologists of several countries. They made a pool of bisylabic common words, and recorded them, then made the volunteers for the study hear them, one by one, beginning with very low sound volume, and slowly increasing it. The Spanish volunteers heard the correct word at much lower sound volumes than in other countries.

This arrived yesterday, what a small box.

Tried out the solo variant, it&#039;s a fun distraction but only gives the slightest whiff of the multi-player game.  I&#039;d certainly play it again even though it is only a beat your own score thing.  I only scored 11!  I think high 20&#039;s and 30&#039;s are more usual but I banjaxed myself by discarding too many soldiers and only using one Entertainment (purple) Guild card (as I had excluded the expansion/promo cards in my play) when these two Missio cards needed to be completed.  Doh!

A quick game, bit deeper than a filler.

:thumbsup: Fun, quick
:thumbsup: Nice looking
:thumbsup: Small, v portable
:thumbsup: I think will be an excellent multiplayer gateway game
:thumbsdown: Will need more plays for informed negatives</body>

I&#039;ve played this solo about a dozen times.  My best score is having only 2 Missio cards left (with a score of around 36 I think), and I now get 30+ points usually every time - but still not completed ALL Missio cards, the elusive elixir!

It&#039;s a nice quick filler solo game, but if I DO ever complete them all, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d want/need to play it solo again.

Would be nice if someone came up with an AI variant where you have to play against that player instead of just beating your high-score...

	<body>[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? [/b]
I think it was referenced in a post in one game or another but I honestly cannot remember.

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
First posted, don&#039;t know. But I do know [thing=142854]Infection: Humanities Last Gasp[/thing] was my first every solitaire game. Yes I still own it and I&#039;m eagerly awaiting new of expansion. :)

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I was blown away by the community. I came from MMO land and that environment has become caustic. The people here are a breath of fresh air.
My first visit to BGG in general was actually multiple visits. It comes up a lot when you search for games on Google and I would come here and then bounce right off in confusion lol. After a while I started to understand things and here I am.

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]
Mmmm....nope.

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
There is so much activity, it never gets old. 

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
I try not to think about it.

[b]If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?[/b]
Magic.

So this is my first Feb post, not much gaming so far this month. I think I&#039;m suffering from my first case of winter depression or something.
I was sitting here last night not wanting to go to bed but not really wanting to get into anything heavy so I ran an eyeball over my shelf and saw Friday.
I lost 1 point shy of taking out the first pirate (54 points, all face up cards count for +1) and ended with a 17 point score.
Haven&#039;t played this one in a while and it&#039;s still a fun little game. Well deserving of it&#039;s position in the peoples choice.</body>

	<body>[b]Today, I found, in my mailbox, a travel ticket to ....[i]Uranus[/i]![/b]

[u]Flashback [/u]
Last month, I wrote a [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/183994/item/3691517#item3691517] post[/url] on [gameid=47055]. 
Actually, the post was more on Rosetta&#039;s recent pictures released than the game itself. 
I haven&#039;t played it lastly and I&#039;m a bit puzzled by the original rulebook. I found an improved [i](hope so, anyway)[/i] one [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95763/high-frontier-alive-and-complete][b] here[/b] [/url]. 

[floatleft] [user=Woelf] [/floatleft]






, in a comment, told us that [gameid=149689] expansion [i](never heard of it before)[/i] added more solo experience. [clear]
However, one need  [gameid=124147] to play it. 
That was exactly the boost I needed to hunt for a copy of colonization!


Just received it today. I was limited to the inner Solar System with the base game and now I have access to Jupiter, Saturne, Uranus...

[b]WAOUH!!! look at the full Solar System board:[/b]

[i] I can [b]easily[/b] understand that not everyone will share my enthusiasm for the board....... [/i] 


[b][size=14]Thank you Kyle![/b][/size]. :D


[u][i][b]PS[/b] [/u] [/i] : some news of Rosetta ? On Feb the 14th, a very close flyby (6km) will take place.

Cool - It&#039;s always great seeing this one pop up on these lists!   You&#039;re welcome, too!


I can say with 100% certainty that this is the best gameboard ever created.   It doesn&#039;t have any of the fancy artwork that you see on most boards, but what is there is a marvel of functionality.   99% of what&#039;s on the board means something and is relevant to playing the game somehow.   Then you add the fact that every site shown on it represents some actual object that&#039;s buzzing around our solar system.  I&#039;ve owned the game for about three years now and still love looking at that thing.

Look closely and you can find a few Easter Eggs too.  For example, in the upper left corner there&#039;s a space marked &quot;Heliopause&quot;, and right next to it is [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1]a tiny silver object[/url].     I can&#039;t recall if it&#039;s on the Colonization board or not, but on the Poster Map version at least there&#039;s also a peculiar object in orbit of Europa.


Even if you never get into most of the extra Colonization stuff (Bernals, Colonists, GW/TW Thrusters, Futures, etc.) and just stick to the Basic or Expanded game, having that extra half to the board really opens things up.   You get a ton of new sites to develop, and gain new access routes to the tried-and-true sites already on the original board - especially if you add the slingshot rule to the basic game [i](there&#039;s no reason to ever leave out even with first-time players)[/i].


The A&amp;C rules are much better for learning the learning the game from scratch than the original set that came in the box, although I actually prefer the original.   To me it&#039;s laid out much more logically, and it&#039;s far better as a reference document when you need to look up specific rules.

I adore this board.  I printed out a copy in poster form and framed it for my office.  People walk in and wonder what the hell it is (they&#039;re confused when I tell them its a game board). 

Supposedly coming down the track, eventually, is a High Frontier Light, with streamlined and simplified rules.

I don&#039;t know when it&#039;ll come out, though.  Right now I know Phil is hard at work on Neanderthal (be jealous... playtester...), so its probably after the 3rd edition of HF (which I&#039;ll ALSO buy).

[q=&quot;often&quot;]Supposedly coming down the track, eventually, is a High Frontier Light, with streamlined and simplified rules.[/q]I&#039;m curious to find out what exactly that means.    It be really nice if &quot;Light&quot; was something similar to the current Basic+Expanded game, where you get a complete, fully-functional game but without the massive pile of extra rules and add-ons from Colonization.   Then the &quot;Full&quot; 3rd Edition would add in all of that stuff from Colonization plus whatever other extras they&#039;ve come up with since then.

Hopefully it doesn&#039;t end up being a stripped-down and/or dumbed-down version that only vaguely resembles the actual game and makes everyone that plays it immediately regret not going for the full version.

[i]I had to do a macro close-up...[/i][/q]That gives you a good indication of just how much &quot;space&quot; the board covers.  As far out as that spot is, there&#039;s still stuff beyond it - all the way out to [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna]Sedna[/url].


You can just barely see the other Easter egg in this image if you know what to look for (and where):
[imageid=947920]
But without access to the Colonization board at the moment I can&#039;t remember if it&#039;s on there too or if it was only added on the Poster Map.

The first time I spotted it, it looked like a graphical glitch or a printing error or flaw of some sort - until I looked closer...

OOOO, looks like the Vassal mod has the Colonization expansion with it.  I&#039;m terrible learning games through Vassal, though this might be worth it (though if anyone&#039;s looking to teach...)

I have the large poster map for HF (got it as a gift from a GeekBud) and absolutely love it.

HF has quite an intimidation factor attached to it, so I will be rather curious to see what the 3rd edition has to offer.

As it stands, HF has one of the best support groups of any title here on BGG (and that includes Kyle, whose passion for the game is contagious and he has personally enhanced my enjoyment of the game).

That is wild. As much as I would love to learn a complex and highly rewarding simulation, I&#039;ll look forward to the inevitable card game version of this, since that seems to be the trend that [company=101][/company] is following.

What annoys me with this game is that it&#039;s a pretty middle-weight game at heart. In fact, the core is much simpler than many Euro games that are popular. The art design and rule text, however, seem to go out of their way to make the game feel ten times more complicated than it really is.

I tried to learn this game and Dungeon Lords at the same time and it was interesting to compare them. In a many ways, Dungeon Lords is more complicated but has a very well-done art design that gives the players what is needed to understand and flow with the game. The card design still makes me dizzy in High Frontier.

There is another 20% of the factor that there exists too many rule exceptions and overwrought systems in High Frontier, especially with the Colonization modules, such that it becomes hard to keep the rules in my head. The A&amp;C ruleset of the Advanced game, however, is pretty solid and, again, if it had nicer designed components designed by someone who realized this was a &#039;game&#039; and not &#039;real life,&#039; would be much better.

	<body>Started the [b]Jovian Wars Prelude[/b] campaign last night with the 51st. I gave the [b]Deadly Strike[/b] talent to my shotgunner.

[b]Mission 1 - S002[/b]
Mission 1 turned out to be Surface 002, the search and rescue of four scientists from Jovian III. Intel indicated [b]Mercenary Forces[/b] on the surface. But our biggest fear were the native Sand Worms. I selected the Shotgunner, C/C unit, Fire Team Alpha, Fire Team Bravo, and the Explorer specialist. We&#039;d also be using the Pilium ATV to cover the vast distances on the surface. I used a full 110 squad points and all 8 allowed resources but chose not to use any Strategic Options in hopes of generating an extra VP if successful.

Things got off to a slow start. We had a hard time making good time on the planet&#039;s surface. In retrospect, when many nodes require a skill check that only one unit can accomplish (such as Pilot by the Pilium ATV), it is a good idea to invest in a lot of intelligence resources. I made a dash for the two locations where scientists were located near or in Cave Complex C. Unfortunately I only found two instead of all four. So I had to back track in a hurry toward Cave Complex B. However, I ran out of time 1-2 turns short of reaching then next scientist&#039;s location. Next time, bring more [b]intel[/b]!

During the course of this mission my squad eliminated three Sand Worms and a small patrol of Mercenary Forces (2 soldiers and 1 sergeant).

Result: [b]Failure[/b]
VP Earned: [b]-1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: -1 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 2 - S004[/b]
Mission 2 found us assigned to destroy an enemy base on an asteroid called New Phobos. The base had recently been taken from us. The brass decided that it was best if no one owned it. To do so we needed to infiltrate an automated Drone defense force and find access through one of two possibly blocked entrances. Our target was the Engine room fuel supply, which when crippled, would explode and cause a huge crater in the asteroid. Intel showed the base was protected by a force of [b]Mutants[/b]. The Squad Leader took Zero G Team Alpha, Zero G Team Bravo, our Sniper, Fire Team Alpha, an Engineer, and a Technician.

The mission ran smooth. After disabling a Drone and entering the base as hoped through Entrance A we ran into a small Mutant patrol in the computer room. Fire combat was brisk and went in our favor. We took some wounds but put down the enemy without suffering any incapacitated troops. Our next and last encounter with the Mutants was after we had breached the Security Door guarding access to the Engine Room. We were able to ambush a small section of Mutants. Two were killed and one wounded before we suffered any return fire. Once the last was neutralized we gained access easily into the Engine Room. Fortunately no hostiles were defending the room. Shortly after that New Phobos had a new crater and a new orbit. Any mutants that survived the blast were doomed to enjoy a lonely and cold death as life support systems failed and zero degrees Kelvin approached.

Result: [b]Success[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+6 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +5 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 3 - H003[/b]
Our 3rd Mission put us in a damn Hive system where an enemy base was thought to be located. These places are always ugly; I don&#039;t think any of us secretly thought we would make it out alive and knock out our objective. We needed to locate the enemy HQ and perforate the honchos inside with holes. The assault team was composed of the Squad Leader, Fire Team Alpha, the Heavy Weapons Team, our Sniper, Assault Team Alpha, and a Demolitionist. The Cybers, a robotic force with some great defensive systems, was holding the unfriendly turf.

There&#039;s not much to say about this. Not much good, anyway, At least we all made it out. We made a bee line for the location we suspected might contain the HQ. Unfortunately that was empty. Along the way we eliminated a group of Drones and got sprayed by some nasty Toxic goo. We had to back track to get to the next target location. Unfortunately we were hit by a couple of Cyber patrols. One of them got the jump on us. Assualt Team Alpha went down and nearly everyone else came out of the fight with a few more holes and burns than they had going in. Clinging to life and carrying Assault Team Alpha on our backs. We were able to make our insertion point and make a timely withdrawal. Mission failed but squad preserved. Assault Team Alpha made it, too. They&#039;re down for a bit in sick bay but will be back with us soon. In the meantime, we&#039;re still waiting to hear whether we&#039;ll be reattempting the assault or writing this one off. We just lost the element of surprise.

Result: [b]Abort[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +6 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 3 - H003 Reattempt[/b]
Command decided we had to go back in and make another attempt on that enemy HQ in the Hive. This time we didn&#039;t make it as far as the first time. We knew they would be expecting us (Nullified the scenario specific special rule describing the enemy being unaware and made all draws on the Enemy Presence Table at +2, both house rules to add flavor). We were greeted at the entrance by 4 Drones. Took us some time to knock them out and we took some hits. The Medic patched up most of the holes before we advanced to the next node. There we found 3 Drones and 2 Guardians waiting for us. Fortunately we were able to execute a Withdrawal under cover of smoke and egress the installation. The Armor used by all Cyber units is particularly challenging. We need to figure out a way around it. So many of our hits do nothing.

Result: [b]Abort[/b]
VP Earned: [b]-1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +5 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 4 - H002[/b]
A report of abducted civilians flung us back into another Hive, this time against Mutant forces. Intel said the civilians were going to be used for biological weapons testing. Our goal was to extract them alive. The Hive was large. All intel showed the civilians&#039; location to be on the far side of our entry point. We pushed our way in and found a likely spot for the civilians to be penned up on a dead end. Unfortunately it was vacant. At least halfway into our allotted time, we could play it safe and head for the entry point to abort or head for one of two remaining spots likely to hold the civilians. We headed for the easiest spot to navigate to. With only minutes to spare we made entry into the holding facility and took down the captors while taking quite a few hits ourselves. Unfortunately the civilians had already been hit. Looks like we were only a few hours too late to save them. Before making our escape we fired their remains and brought the ceiling down on them. Hopefully denying the enemy any use of their experiments.

Result: [b]Success[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+4 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +9 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 5 - S007[/b]
Brass had determined the location of a hideout on Xargon IV used by those wacko but insanely deadly suicide cultists who followed The Dark God. They&#039;d been wreaking havoc on several civilian worlds and space stations in the area and the brass wanted on the ground confirmation that they and their hideout had been sterilized. So we went in. But we didn&#039;t make it very far. We were hit hard in both of the first two sectors we passed into. Our Pilium ATV was annihilated by a couple suicide Cultists; we were lucky enough to make an emergency exit at the last minute. Not so the gunner and driver. After mopping the remaining few Cultists up we got hit hard in the next zone. By hit hard I mean that my entire squad was down once the last Cultist had blown himself up. They still showed signs of life. I called a Rapid Intervention Team to recover them while I headed back to our extraction point. Fire Team Bravo will need a couple weeks in Rehab before they can get back in it. The Sniper and Shotgunner got lucky and made out pretty well. Fire Team Alpha and the Medic...well, we&#039;ll miss them.

Result: [b]Abort[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +10 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 6 - S008[/b]
We lost a communication relay hidden within an asteroid belt to an enemy attack. Time to go reestablish commo! We inserted with our Zero G Teams and the Shotgunner. We were assisted by a Technician who we needed to help us navigate the technical aspects of this operation.  The enemy must have known we were coming because they hit us unexpectedly hard. We were attacked by Flesh Eaters in 7 of the 9 zones we maneuvered through. We made good time but they kept hitting us. As wounds started to mount and supplies began to run low a feeling of desperation set it. At the first power station our technician could only power up one of the two power couplings. We were hoping he&#039;d be able to get both couplings powered up at the nearby station, otherwise it would necessitate another journey to the furthest power station. The way we were getting hit it looked like we&#039;d all be sucking vacuum if that was necessary. Fortunately we got lucky and eliminated the forces holding the second station and our technician got both of the couplings powered up. It took tenacity to blast through 23 Flesh Eaters to find success, but this victory they couldn&#039;t take away from us!

Result: [b]Success[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+8 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +18 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 7 - S005[/b]
A craft on some kind of black ops mission when down. We were tasked with recovering the radio and a cache of supplies that were believed to have survived the crash. We went in light against the Mutant forces reported to be on the surface. This was a bad idea. Immediately after setting foot on the ground we were hit by a strong Mutant patrol. We took stiff casualties and several of our troops were incapacitated. We evacuated with nothing to show for our efforts. Fortunately everyone made it out alive. We took one straight to the jaw.

Result: [b]Abort[/b]
VP Earned: [b]+1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +19 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 7 - S005 Reattempt[/b]
Apparently what went down on that ship was important so they told us to get back at it. We were still pretty light going in the second time. Probably a bad decision but resources were getting scarce and were needed for multiple efforts. This time we made it just shy of our first objective. We had made it through three hairy engagements prior to running into this fourth group, comprised of only one Mutant who happened to be accompanied by an Abomination. Already low on resources we fought this one by the skin of our teeth. When it was over both the enemies were dead but the squad had lost nearly all of its combat effectiveness. We evacuated once again from this damned planet. Despair had set in. We weren&#039;t doing so hot and the big picture didn&#039;t look good.

Result: [b]Abort[/b]
VP Earned: [b]-1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +18 VP[/b]

[b]Mission 8 - H006[/b]
We were getting ready to pull back. The war was not going well and the brass was hoping some consolidation and reorganization would help. Just before we can ship out to somewhere relatively safer they catch wind of another enemy HQ far beneath the surface of some crap-hole planet. The Followers of the Dark God were holding it. Guess who gets to go in? It was a suicide mission - we told that to each other anyway. No one outside our company was interested in hearing about it. We were right. After making our initial entry we were immediately hit by an Acolyte and four Cultists in a Pitch Black sector. We entered Melee combat abruptly. We all had decent cover and tried to lay adequate fire to keep them from maneuvering. No luck. Or rather, no light. Three of them sprinted forward in the pitch black, dancing nearly unseen between our fire. They detonated suicide vests. None of us remember anything after that. Our Rapid Intervention Team was waiting just the other side of the entry point and came hot. They managed to pull us out of there just before more explosions brought the ceiling down. Somehow we all survived. At least until the next suicide run they put us on.

Result: [b]Failure[/b]
VP Earned: [b]-1 VP[/b]
[b]Running Score: +17 VP[/b]

I&#039;m getting my butt kicked. Fortunately I haven&#039;t lost any troops yet, but that failure on Mission 1 is smarting still. Had it not been so long since my last play I would have done a couple things differently and attempted to abort the mission instead of desperately trying to succeed on a Hail Mary.

My initial impressions of the best way to play everything about this game seem to be pretty far off. From assigning talents to determining what traits specific units improve with accumulated XP to mission planning; success is proving to be a formidable challenge.

It is fun try to figure out a way to defeat the randomly determined enemies I&#039;m facing on very different mission maps. Fun until I realize that I planned poorly! Hive missions are tough. Ugh.

The outcome of this campaign isn&#039;t looking like something to be proud of currently.

The missions leave me both enjoying them and feeling frustrated. The game is difficult. I also haven&#039;t figured out how best to approach the missions so as to minimize my odds at failure. My early impression regarding the proper implementation of my assets was faulty and I don&#039;t know if I can recover. It makes it a bit harder to go on when I don&#039;t think I can make it work. I&#039;ve got some ideas but will have to wait for a new campaign to see if they work.

The other problem I have is that some of the enemies are so difficult that I don&#039;t see how it&#039;s possible to succeed against them. I&#039;ve already eliminated three enemy groups from play because I don&#039;t want to play against them knowing it will be for naught.

I read a comment by the designer about facing one of the harder enemies, that they are designed for a specific strategy-using smoke bombs or something to cause them to become a melee opponent I think it was-in order to make them easier to beat. I guess part of the game is divining those little tricks. Not having played but once or twice I am not really expert enough to say if that is so or not.

I think I read the same thing Dave.

What I&#039;m struggling with right now is that my ineptitude (based solely on being inexperienced with this game, I hope) has put me in a bad place late into the campaign. As the Alert level rises the game does indeed get tougher. Having more failures than successes at this point has stunted the growth (via XP points) of my squad and made them less likely to handle even the gentler combinations of mission and enemy.

Toss in a real monster like the Dark Roots or the new enemies in the expansion (Beast Masters and Cthonians) and some missions look all but hopeless.

I&#039;ve got a better feel for how to proceed next time. I hope the game doesn&#039;t beat the spirit out of me because I&#039;d really like to play the same campaign again with a different approach.

I think there&#039;s far more strategy to this game than meets the eye.

Let&#039;s be brutal : we knew it would end like this for a some time....

Even if I don&#039;t have the game and surely missed some meaningful details, I had a lot of pleasure to read your analysis.

Glad you enjoyed it Koinsky. Hearing comments like that make all the typing feel more worthwhile and rewarding. 

The campaign was a strange mix of fun and occasional accomplishment with frustration. This game is hard. I&#039;ve played 17 missions total now and feel as if I have only a small piece of the comprehension necessary to play well. Frustration aside, I am looking forward to playing another campaign soon to capitalize on my experience so far.

Segueing to another thought now... It has been nice to focus on just one game. Usually I play a bit then like a butterfly alight to a new branch to see what&#039;s there, continuously flitting about for only short duration stops wherever I land. I hope to transition back and forth between Space Infantry and Silent War for a bit to gain a deeper understanding for each.

Focusing on two for the time being is much more attractive than playing ten different games once each. Part of my new angle of attack for solo gaming in 2015: [geeklist=185155][/geeklist]

A good read Ryan, thanks for writing that up. I really enjoy about 90% of this game, and would love to get it back to the table. I started a campaign and was writing up missions here, but only got through 3 or so (all losses I think) before I &quot;flitted&quot; off to something else.

The game has some really great mechanics (some of which I may even &quot;adopt&quot; for something of my own), but every time I think about playing it I remember all the chit pulling and decide not to.

I decided that I really like the chit pulling over die rolling. I used the die rolling variant and decided it took too long/was too clunky compared to drawing chits.

The biggest impediment I feel toward playing is the impending sense of doom from a mission that seems nigh impossible. I don&#039;t like going to the work of setting up and playing a game when I know there&#039;s not much I can do to win.

Hopefully, I&#039;ll be able to minimize that occurrence in the future with more skillful play.

I&#039;m glad the game is 90% working out for you, Jack. If I remember correctly an early perspective of mine may have had a bit to do with that...

	<body>As mentioned [listitem=3710246]way back at the beginning of this list[/listitem], this was my Origin game.  Technically I didn&#039;t even play it solo that time, but it was one of my goals for the month and it did get played, just with other, non-robot opponents.
---------------------------------

[b]Solo Play
Brazil map
2 Robots:[/b]

[bgcolor=purple][color=white][b]Purple Robot[/b]
1) Early Choice For All [/color][/bgcolor]
[color=red][size=7][i](The rules say to leave this piece out with two or more Robots, but I didn&#039;t notice that until after starting and it still seemed to work okay as-is.)[/i][/size][/color]
[bgcolor=purple][color=white]2) Highest Number; Max Bid=Min+Cities
3) All
4) 1:1, 2:2, 3:3
5) Always Last[/color][/bgcolor]

[bgcolor=green][color=white][b]Green Robot[/b]
1) Player&#039;s Choice
2) First For Minimum
3) Normal
4) Only Supplied
5) All Cities Cost 10[/color][/bgcolor]

I hadn&#039;t played this in ages, so it was long overdue for another trip to the table.

[floatright][imageid=2410814][/floatright]Coal was a very scarce resource on this map, so right away I tried to push both of the robots into buying the inefficient coal plants so they&#039;d be competing directly with each other for a dwindling supply.  Meanwhile, I went for the inexpensive oil and managed to grab both of the early wind plants.   Purple was effectively shut down early, but Green&#039;s slow and steady approach proved a bit tougher to crack.  It pulled ahead briefly in number of cities and cash on hand, but with it invested heavily in coal and BioGas [i](thematic replacement for garbage on this board)[/i] it was only a matter of time before it came crashing back down when the supplies dried up.  

Two turns later  the coal and biogas were gone and both Robots were floundering; Purple kept spending money on resources it didn&#039;t really need so it couldn&#039;t afford to expand, which took away just enough that it prevented Green from running (and building) to full capacity.  At the same time I used my wind-assisted nuclear plant to expand rapidly and push the game into Step 2, with the endgame within easy reach.  Two turns later I was able to build up to 17 cities and could power 15 for the win; Green had 11 cities but had no power at all; Purple had 8 cities with surplus power.

Resource deprivation proved to be the winning play with this set of robots.   A human would have gone away from coal and biogas long before they dried up, but these robots aren&#039;t programmed to feel pain.

----------------------------------

[thing=2651][/thing]
:thumbsup:  One of the best &quot;Pure Euro&quot; and Economic games ever created.  Period.
:thumbsup:  Loads of expansion maps and promo items to add tons of variety and replayability.

:thumbsup::thumbsdown:   Virtually no luck involved.

:thumbsdown:  No solo option in the box, and little in the way of variants aside from doing it multiplayer solo.
:thumbsdown:  Tends to get &quot;mathy&quot;, so beware of AP!
:thumbsdown:  The theme is kind of boring (but at least it&#039;s unique!)

-----------------
[thing=108667][/thing]
:thumbsup:  Solo Option!!!
:thumbsup:  Puts up a pretty decent challenge if you use at least two or three Robots

:thumbsup::thumbsdown:  The Robots cheat.  [i](Each gets a special ability that gives it an advantage, like extra starting money, discounted buildings, rebates on their bids, etc.)[/i]

:thumbsdown:  Not actually designed for solo, so there&#039;s a little bit of weirdness with some of the abilities.  Some minor modifications are required.
:thumbsdown:  Sometimes the Robots make really dumb &quot;decisions&quot; that can be exploited.</body>

Nice write up Kyle, I picked up the Robots a long time ago with an eye on solo play but never got around to it.  I did put it on my goals list and this has tempted me to break it out sooner than later... Power Grid is definitely one game in my collection that doesn&#039;t get out nearly enough.

[q=&quot;klkitchens&quot;]Gonna use the SoloPlay rules, but thought I&#039;d use the bots to help learn the game.[/q]How well do those play compared to the standard game?

I haven&#039;t looked into the SoloPlay rules for PG, but from what I&#039;ve seen of those variants for [i]other[/i] games so much gets added or changed that it ends up feeling like you&#039;re playing a completely different game.  That&#039;s fine when the only other alternative is not playing the game it at all, but it&#039;s pretty far away from my preference.    

The Robots work really well for solo, despite their issues, because you&#039;re still playing plain old Power Grid.  All they&#039;re really doing is simulating opponents in the most direct way possible, but the rules to the game itself are exactly the same as normal.

I like the SoloPlay rules quite a bit actually.  The idea is that the AI helps to block where you can expand, and the utilization of resources is also quite good.  The rules are easy to implement, and IMO doesn&#039;t deviate too much from fundamental gameplay.

I just picked up the robots.  This game has sat unplayed on my shelf for a year now. I&#039;ll be learning both the robots and soloplay rules.

	<body>[b]February, 11th[/b]

[i]First play of this one as soon as it arrived at my doorstep.[/i]

I randomly dealt one(!) hero, an epic foe and the outer regions. Else I played the easy variant, in order to get the rules down. After my play I realized that I was supposed to use two heroes ...

My hero was the Paladin and the epic foe was the Demon Lord. The Paladin did pretty well, but she was lucky that the single dire enemy showed up only in the last turn before the epic foe hit the stage. So I guess this game was the &quot;super easy&quot; variant.
When the Demon Lord arrived all the outer regions were in pretty good shape and the Capital City hadn&#039;t received any damage so far. So the Paladin could concentrate on taking out her epic foe, letting everything else go up in flames.

Here&#039;s a photograph of the game state at the end of the game:
[imageid=2411199]

:thumbsup: small &quot;pick your fights&quot;-game
:thumbsdown: The rulebook is not very well structured (at least for my mind).
:thumbsdown: Though the flame tokens are nice, they are bit small for my clumsy fingers.

Edit: Does anybody know why the picture shows right side up on my computer but upside down on BGG?


[i]Second play the same day:[/i]
This time Cleric and Sorcerer defended against The Ancient. Still the easy variant, but the dire enemy showed up early in the game this time. However, the heroes managed to keep the outer regions in good shape until the epic foe arrived. Concentrating all forces on The Ancient won me the game, again.

A few weeks ago there were some issues with imaging uploading.  Sounds like they changed the coding behind it and screwed something up somewhere.

Haha, I thought that was a sly reference to my Tiny Epic Defenders image a couple of pages back!

I think it&#039;s something in the metadata of the image file that BGG is ignoring. With my image, the preview pic in the email was upside-down, but the actual picture file, when opened in my computer, was right-side up. When I uploaded it, it was upside down again.

I&#039;m not enough of a computer geek to know if there&#039;s a fix to this.

	<body>Set this up a few days ago and took a turn here and there.  Had a pretty easy go of it, mostly.  My primary target (which was the Dwarf Warrior) only managed to take 3 wounds, one of which was intentional so he could counterattack and take out Greenknee (the bastard).

I got really lucky with the Damsel quest/event, as the encounter there was pretty easy and I was able to rescue her without incident.  

I really enjoyed my time with this, and the game flowed very well this time.  There weren&#039;t a ton of special cases, but after playing this a few times (second recorded play after my first few aborted attempts), I think I&#039;ve got a somewhat decent handle on the rules.

Quick question for those who have played:

Normally, no matter how much I lose by during the defense stage, I only put one wound on the primary target (unless it&#039;s a poison attack, or some other special type), right?  Even if I choose to not defend at all?

[b]Edit[/b]

Sometimes the shuffle gods giveth, and sometimes they taketh away.

Setup a second game using the standard 80 card decks.  Semirandomized both the dungeon deck and the crawler deck (mostly even amounts of each type of card, made sure there were at least 30 creatures, then grabbed another 15 cards from the starter deck) using the mines expansion.  Crawler deck consists of roughly equal numbers of each type of card, with a few favorites tossed in.

Drew my first encounter:

[imageid=2411567 large]

going to be a tough one.</body>

Adventure: [b]Perils of the Lost Coast[/b]
Scenario: [b]Black Fang&#039;s Dungeon[/b]
[color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] (Death of Valeros)

I continue with my group of 2 with my own Pathfinder variant I describe [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312765/my-own-variant]here[/url].

That was difficult from the very beginning with a Spectre. And it continued with a Werewolf and a Shadow. I think I need to reconsider adding Werewolf in this scenario by the way. The life of Lini and Valeros were going low. But I was still confident to continue exploring as Valeros had a Half-Plate in hand and 4 cards in his deck. But here was a Siren. Full damage that can&#039;t be reduced + a Soldier discarded from the deck due to her ability. 3 cards remaining in the deck and 4 to draw. Game over for Valeros.

[b]Acquisitions[/b]
[u]Lini[/u]: Aid - Inflict

[b]Next[/b]
Well, I need to restart [b]Perils of the Lost Coast[/b] with Valeros. That will allow me to death management rules on my variant.

[u]Edit:[/u] Too bad for me, I&#039;ve just figured out that the Temple ability would have saved Valeros&#039; life.</body>

	<body>Printed out squad sheets created by our fearless leader [user=fractaloon]fractaloon[/user] and the update rulebook and now getting ready to play.

2015-02-11 - [b][blogpost=38784][/blogpost][/b]

2015-02-15 - Brief update.  Have played very briefly, but boy a lot as gone on.  Operations didn&#039;t last long before the first encounter and we were  plunged into rounds.  Have done three rounds so far and now have three Germans in play, one soldier wounded and another incapacitated.  Not gonna post a lot of details here given the canned nature of the scenarios.  I can see though if I&#039;m wiped out early on, that I would play this like a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; or &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; and just keep replaying until I get through it successfully.

But, so far...

[o][b][size=18]LOADS OF FUN!!![/size][/b][/o]

Small spoiler... the event came up where this guy drives across the map and it was totally unexpected...

[imageid=2415768medium]

It had those watching in the bleachers completely speechless!

[imageid=2415769medium]

On a serious note, my upgraded card deck from the Game Crafter actually arrived today, so I immediately put it into tonight&#039;s festivities...  Here&#039;s a side by side (of cards not currently in use) for comparison.

Did you know that the Battle of Hastings wasn&#039;t actually in Hastings? It was in open countryside. William had a Monastery/Abbey built on the site and the village that grew up around it was named &#039;Battle&#039;. So it could be called the Battle of Battle now, though at the time it could have been called the battle of Senlac Hill.

[b]What brought you here?[/b]

[user=shacky22] brought me here. I think we were on the FTL thread, and he mentioned this awesome place.

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]

I believe it was [thing=65564][/thing] or [thing=121921][/thing]. Both, I still own and enjoy a lot.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]

I noticed what a cool group of cats are here.

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]

Was a little nervous at first, but found everyone to be really welcoming.

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]

Reading the stories of others&#039; escapades and hearing about new games and such, keeps me checking this place out daily.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]

[thing=96848][/thing], [thing=39683][/thing], [thing=129437][/thing], and possibly [thing=149951][/thing] were all purchases made from learning about them here. So definitely some ducats. And I have been happy with all the purchases.

Yup, I&#039;ve used to be an active lurker and posted maybe once or twice a week in FTL, but there were something things I was noticing going on that made it where I didn&#039;t want to keep up. Finally I just left, and it was about the time I found SGOyT. I&#039;ve been active here since and find my time spent here better used. :)

It also seems that my username is showing up here more than I am posting. :modest:

	<body>Picked up this pretty little two-player game today to play with my girlfriend. Quick to play, easy to teach but quite a bit of strategic depth and replayability. Couldn&#039;t wait for her to get home so I came up with a quick and dirty &quot;beat your score&quot; solo variant that seems to work quite well.

[imageid=2411763 medium]

[imageid=2411765 medium]

Game is a 3x3 grid of tiles, each tile with a set number of cattle on it and one randomized token. Cattle are 4 different colours and they are distributed randomly on the board. Players are represented by a two-sided token, each player represented on one side of it. Each turn the current player takes all of the cattle of one single colour off their tile, then moves the player token a number of orthogonal spaces equal to the number of cattle taken and flips the player token to the other players side. You cannot move the player token to a space with no cattle. Then the next player goes. If you take the last cattle off a square, you also take the token (which can have varying effects, good and bad). Game ends if a player is forced to take the sheriff tile (they lose), one player gets all 9 cattle of one colour (they win), or there is no legal move left. If there is no legal move left, the players take score, high score wins.

Here is an example of me with no legal move left (just picked up one cattle):

[imageid=2411769 medium]

The 3x3 grid is arranged randomly each time, there are 18 tokens but only 9 are used in each game, and the cattle colours are distributed randomly too. Seems like a ton of replayability for such a small game.

Scoring is interesting, you get $100 x (remaining cattle) for each cattle of any given colour you have (i.e. if you have 3 black in your collection and 4 black remain on the board you score 3 x (4 x $100) or $1200. Plus you add any gold tokens collected. 

Here is my solo variant (posted [thread=1318929]here[/thread] for easy linkage):

[size=18][b]Longhorn solo variant
[/b][/size]
1 - Set up the board as per regular instructions.

2 - Play as one character only.

3 - All tokens have the standard effect except [i]Extra Turn[/i] and [i]Ambush[/i] tokens will have no impact on play. If you clear a space with an [i]Extra Turn[/i] or [i]Ambush[/i] token, simply remove it from play.

4 - Gathering all 9 of one colour cattle will [b]not[/b] win the game.

5 - Take each turn as a single player. Stockpile all cattle and tokens acquired in one pool. 

6 - If arrested by Sheriff, game is lost.

7 - Once you can no longer make a legal move, tally your score as per normal instructions.

8 - Try and beat your high score.

My scores so far:

[b]Game 1[/b] - 6000
[b]Game 2[/b] - 8300
[b]Game 3[/b] - 5100
[b]Game 4[/b] - 8100

In the solo variant you are attempting to get 4 or 5 of each colour cattle for maximum score, while avoiding the sheriff (who will only show up 50% of the time) and trying to create an endgame position before you are forced to take too many cattle. 

:thumbsup: Gorgeous components
:thumbsup: Cheap (I picked it up for $15)
:thumbsup: Quick to set-up and play but lots of thinking involved
:thumbsup: Cowboys!
:thumbsdown: Not designed for solo play out of the box. Not sure how much longevity my solo variant will have (but optimistic).
:thumbsdown: I imagine it will be more interesting to play 2P (but haven&#039;t tried it that way yet).

[b]Update Feb. 14:
[/b]
Finally played this two player with my girlfriend and it has remarkable strategic depth for such a tiny footprint/ruleset. Will be trying it out again with my solo variant a few times before I can recommend it as a solo only game, but definitely worth it at the price as a quick but deep 2-player filler game.</body>

Lewis and Clark does look gorgeous. I don&#039;t own it yet but it keeps popping up in my peripheral vision.

Saw this game at the FLGS for cheap and it was so beautiful I knew I wanted it, but I have become better at reading up on games instead of impulse purchasing. Went home and looked up the reviews and I was happy when I saw it was well received. This is a perfect game to play with my girlfriend who doesn&#039;t have the patience to learn complicated rules, but loves a game with some depth. She beats me regularly at most things we play together.

	<body>[size=18][b]ORIGIN STORY:[/size]

What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page? [/b]
I ended up seeing geekbadges for solitaire play, and since I have a hard time meeting up with people because of my schedule and kids I figured I&#039;d get one of the badges.  I checked out the list and just started posting.
[b]

What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
The first game I posted was Space Empires 4x, although I had been playing a lot of games solo before posting here.  I still own it and have the second expansion on P500 order.  I enjoy the game quite a bit but it hasn&#039;t hit the table as much as I&#039;d like - I&#039;m actually clipping the counters now.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I saw a ton of games being played that I either had never heard of or had little interest in, but after repeated entries they went on to my &quot;check out&quot; list and then to my shopping cart at some of my OLGS.


[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]
I noticed there are a lot of &quot;Kevins&quot; in the SGoYT. :D

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
I like reading about the games, solo experiences, and feel some connection with everyone that plays solo games - it&#039;s our own &quot;cult&quot; of sorts.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
I&#039;m not even going to go there.... seriously.
Ok, well since you asked - I have no idea, but I know it was a lot and because of it I have a geeklist that tracks all my purchases and sales for 2015 to ensure I&#039;m not out of control.

[b]If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?[/b]

Ah! What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour! The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds!

	<body>Played this using the Researcher, Scientist, and Containment Specialist.
I had the red, yellow, and blue cured, and for the longest time the outbreak marker was sitting at 6 and the rolls were going in my favor..but I got cocky and kept re-rolling my characters dice to get what I needed, and BOOM outbreak city, and game over man.
Really dig this game, it has replaced Pandemic(as far as solo play), and I love rolling dice.</body>

This is a good walkthrough of DDD, Rev :D

http://boardgamegeek.com/video/18902/d-day-dice/rules-primer-session

For the record, I personally didn&#039;t find the game too enthralling but having learned the Rev&#039;s tastes, I think it&#039;s something that&#039;d really sit well with him

I guess this counts as an origin story, since this is my first addition to SGOYT.  I&#039;ve been lurking for a couple months, but this is the first time I felt I&#039;ve had something useful to add.

I played the [filepage=41710]SoloPlay variant[/filepage] of Carcassonne for the first time, with just the base game.  It *kicked my ass*.  I scored an 80 the first play, and then 64 the second.  

That...  kinda makes me want to play like five more times.</body>

	<body>I played the first mission of this with four Rebels. I had a look at some of the AI options for the Empire, but I just boiled it down to a simple series of rules for this scenario - either move and attack a Rebel (max range of 4, except for E-web with a range of 7), attacking the weakest non-wounded Rebel Or move to block the Rebels getting through. The officers used their command power to do the same. It was really close - last round three rebel allies were wounded and attacking the last two terminals. One Imperial Officer moved in from of a terminal. He died, but saved the terminal, with the Rebels just losing.

It is a fun game to play. I didn&#039;t fell like I need to completely abstract the Empire. I think there was one option that I ended up rolling a die to decide.</body>

Not sure if you (or anyone else) is interested, but I&#039;m working on a web app version of the Automated Emperor deck. I just pushed out an alpha for Redjak7 to take a look at, but it should be ready for some beta testing soon. I&#039;m looking for some folks to give it a try.

Here&#039;s a link to the Alpha if anyone is interested:

http://ae.couchoud.com

It works best as a &quot;Homescreen&quot; app on iOS or Android devices. It also works on desktop in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox. It should work in IE11, but I haven&#039;t had a chance to test it yet... YMMV.

	<body>I borrowed this one from my brother as I haven&#039;t played it. (Either solo or &quot;with other people&quot;.) And I reckon thats the last play for me. 

The game was ok. But completing the adventures was very samey. I didn&#039;t have a lot of tension with rolling the dice. The game felt very random. I won in the end before the Elder One came out, but it didn&#039;t feel satisfying - more thank goodness that is over so I can play something else.

In comparison I played Ghost Stories last night, and had a great time. The rolls were tense, the ghosts coming out where exciting and painful. And Wei Feng went down (just).</body>

Hmm...there are definitely ways to improve the game if you decided to play again. It is pretty easy to win, depending on the ancient one you&#039;re fighting, which is the first problem. I play that you must combat the ancient one AFTER collecting the Elder Signs needed to win, but you only need to damage it equal to the number of doom tokens on the track at that time. If it awakens, tough cookies--that&#039;s an instant loss.

The game also becomes harder/more interesting when playing with more investigators with different abilities to call on, adding some strategy to which adventures to assign each character to. If an investigator dies while playing solo, you should remove that character from the game instead of drawing a new one, and if all investigators die, you lose. (This is how the app handles it.)

The game really opens up as you become more familiar with it and you start to more deeply consider the rewards/penalties of the adventures. It&#039;s still just &quot;okay&quot; for me, but I like it enough that I&#039;ve got the newest expansion on its way.

I like your variant, will have to give that a try.

I definitely found that the first expansion greatly improved this game for me. It is fairly light, but I don&#039;t mind that when it suits my mood. Looking forward to the Gates of Arkham expansion too.

I just picked this up at my local Barnes and Noble for $20. I&#039;ll post up my impressions after a couple of playthroughs. I already have the first expansion on my wishlist with Amazon though as I understand from reading here that it greatly enhances the gameplay.

The base game can be fairly easy. I find the Unseen Forces expansion significantly increases the difficulty. If you enjoy the base game it is worth the investment. Playing through the Gates of Arkham expansion today. Report to come.

	<body>Waking up extra early and playing this while my coffee buzz is fresh is a great way to start the day. 

This play I found myself really thinking through each choice, rather than rush myself in an impatient state. I truly think my mood has slightly improved :)

I really enjoyed this play. I took two loans but I felt that I was able to use them to their fullest extent. For example, in the first turn, I had 4 bucks remaining which is enough to get to space 3. However, if I took a loan, I&#039;d have enough to get to space 4 AND have a dollar remaining so it was a no-brainer. 

Endgame, I ended off with 18.15 minus two spaces for the loans. A 16! Still improving. Hoping my next game has me hitting the 17, which the rulebook feels is the lowest score worth mentioning :p</body>

	<body>I ran Merisiel Solo last night with the &#039;Trouble in Sandpoint&#039; scenario using themed locality decks and a deck built up slowly using an gradual deck building idea I am looking at.

Result - two tough tries at the scenario; first one she got wiped out and almost killed as a 14 Combat check for the Villain cost 9 wounds! (A d10, d8 and 2d6 threw only 9 with a penalty of 4 for the Bastard Sword.) This wiped out her hand and left just one in the deck after drawing back to five. She fled the scenario to fight another day.Â 

Second attempt was a glorious hard fought victory.

I am still not sure if playing these two variants together is just too difficult. When I tried it before on other scenarios I found it so tough going I introduced a search ability to access needed cards, i was persuaded that was too easy so I am trying the tough way again... 
I did really enjoy that hard win !

As Valeros died, he has to restart the whole adventure from the very beginning. So here he is facing Brigandoom!! again and alone. I continued, of course, with my own Pathfinder variant I describe [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312765/my-own-variant]here[/url].

I thought it would be a defeat as Valeros&#039;s life was really running low. And I had the whole Woods to visit and Jubrayl Vhiski to defeat twice as the Academy was still opened with no card in it. Hopefully, Jubrayl was the first card of the Woods&#039; deck and Valeros had a few weapons in hand and in his deck. So Valeros was able to defeat [b]Brigandoom!![/b] alone.

	<body>The quickest game of this I have ever played.

I played with 2 characters - Dispatcher and Researcher.
I only had 4 epidemic cards in the deck.
The game lasted 10 turns (5 rounds) and about 15 minutes.

The initial cities drawn were either in the middle of nowhere or, in the case of the triple marker cities, directly next to each other. At this point I knew the game was going to be tough as it would take a few turns just to get to the cities.

The starting player cards were very good (5 yellows between the players and an event card). In retrospect it was probably a bad set of cards as the Researcher spend their first turn offloading their yellow cards to the Dispatcher rather than trying to get to the infected cities. The mistake was exacerbated by drawing an epidemic card on the first turn. The infected city was next to the other ones that also had 3 markers and one of those cities was drawn for the intensify action. This led to a double outbreak and only 4 remaining black markers.

The next few rounds were just firefighting but another outbreak did occur with a different colour city. There were then 2 consecutive turns with outbreaks before drawing a second epidemic card. I thought it was game over at that point but the cards were having too much fun toying with me so they gave me some nice cities for that draw. Finally, on turn 10, I drew Jakarta which already had 3 markers. This spread the infection to Sidney which also had 3 markers and caused the last outbreak leading to me losing.

Had Jakarta not had 3 markers I would have run out of black markers on the next city draw.

[ImageID=2412909 large]
[ImageID=2412915 large]

[i][b]Edit 13/2 - Second Play[/b][/i]
This time I chose Operations Expert and Scientist for my characters. The game lasted twice as long (30 minutes) but still used just 4 Epidemic cards. I won the game with 3 turns left before the player deck ran out but could have ended it 2 turns earlier had I not have eradicated the blue disease.

This time the initial infected cities were much better positioned and no 2 critical cities (i.e. already had 3 markers) were next to each other. The scientist managed to cure blue early on but the infected cities were spread out. The Operations Expert cleared out the black markers and drew enough black city cards to cure and eradicate on his next turn. The red markers were left to spread and led to 4 outbreaks while the yellow cities had a further 2 outbreaks. The yellow disease was the last one to be cured but the red was the closest to costing me the game (only 4 markers left).

[i][b]Edit 14/2 - Third Play[/b][/i]
I decided to play with 2 characters I hadn&#039;t used together before - Medic and Quarantine Specialist. The game seemed easy as both of these characters are very strong if used correctly but I only won the game on the very last turn. There were only 2 outbreaks and they both came from drawing the Infect card a second time for the Intensify stage.

I managed to cure each disease in the order they are printed on the board (not that there are any bonus points for this).

:thumbsup: - Each game is slightly different and a challenge.
:thumbsdown: - Sometimes the draw of the city cards can make even a game with the easiest settings really difficult.
:thumbsdown: - I lost :cry:</body>

There&#039;s nothing worse than looking forward to playing a game and then losing almost immediately. At least that early into a game you can just reset and start again.

Wow, you found all four cures very quickly.

Oh, sorry. You mean you lost. Pandemic kills the world in four turns. You don&#039;t find the cures that quickly.

I think I lost a 2 player game with my wife in only 2-3 turns once.

Thanks. I recently got a new mobile and am still testing the camera.

Trying to take as many photos as I can before I climb Snowdon next month. I don&#039;t want to take my DSLR but will have my mobile for emergencies so hoping it will be good enough.

	<body>I&#039;m trying to use Vassal to play some &quot;slower and longer&quot; games.  I usually don&#039;t have the stomach to play any boardgames for any length of time while sitting at a computer, but doing 1 turn at a time is certainly feasible and fun, (I&#039;ve been playing in a 6 player game of Arkham Horror for months now) and it turns out this is the perfect game to be played on Vassel.

The board isn&#039;t huge, so you don&#039;t find yourself scrolling all around trying to see everything.  Most of the &quot;noise&quot; of the other cards on the table are in other windows that you can close so usually you&#039;re just looking at your hand and the board (and occasionally your player mat to see your army and your mana stones). And staring at the screen blankly for 10 minutes is frustrating in other games, but is kind of expected in this one!

So I&#039;m in day 3 of the solo conquest, and I&#039;m doing rather poorly.  I&#039;m Tovak at level 4.  I&#039;ve got my army of 2 with a nice skill of being able to heal one or untap one (which I sadly already had to use).  I only just now found the first (Red) city, but I&#039;m staring at it through the middle of two Draconians.  I wouldn&#039;t be too worried, but I just spent my big battle cards clearing a spawning ground for a sweet artifact (Forget what it&#039;s called...something like the golden mana orb).  Looks like I&#039;ll have to wait until the last night to do much, but I&#039;m hedged in by mountains, so I&#039;m not sure to do with what&#039;s left of the day.  A tough spot to be in...especially when I took down a Keep on my second turn of the game!

[b]Edit 2-16-15[/b]  Well, I ended up doubling back and exploring another tile and revealing the Blue city.  I also revealed some dragons I could take, so BAM, down they went and up a level I go.  Got a nice skill to get a badass unit, so I picked up some fire golems at my keep and headed back to the red city.  I took down more dragons but that used my last cards and the night was over.  With my ability to untap a unit and the deck I had, if I had another morning I probably would have been able to take both cities, but I&#039;m still new at this game (only 5 or so plays), so I&#039;ll take it.

Final score: 60.

:thumbsup: Epically big and engaging.

I don&#039;t know, when I&#039;m surrounded by enemies with Influence cards in my hand, or Siege cards but tiles away from anything to hit, there&#039;s nothing worse than that.  Or you figure out the perfect selection of moves to get the job done only to find you don&#039;t have enough movement to actually ATTACK the enemy so you have to start over from square 1.  Oi.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, I still love it, but sometimes when my wheels are spinning but getting no traction, I get grumbly.  Luckily I can walk away for a while and that always helps.  I don&#039;t think I could play this with other players (non-pbem) without rushing turns and performing horribly.

	<body>I&#039;ve had this out since the 1st of this month, played through the tutorial first and then onto the full solo game.

Randomly chose the Viet Cong. For most of the game it really was quite up and down, each faction getting ahead then pulled back, very interesting. There was quite a battle for saigon (i think is key to winning) and after the 4th or 5th coup card i managed to get a stronghold in there and get the opposition i needed. By the end of the last coup card i was the only one to get above the victory margin and that was over six, so victory!!! In my first game too, so very happy with that!!!


I have [thing=127518][/thing]coming, so looking forward to that and P500&#039;d the other three titles, but if someone wants to sell [thing=111799][/thing] to me, PM me please :D

Now, i might get a game of [thing=91080][/thing] in while i wait for ADP (yes i think i will be a COIN junkie :D)</body>

Two more are coming out in 3Q, Gallic War and Liberty or Death. There is also a revision of the bots for Andean Abyss from the designer that gave you the Fire in the Lake bots coming out in C3I Nr 28 which is just about to be released that allows the player to play Andean Abyss from any side solitaire. The original AA only allows for solitaire play from the Government side. So, it is a good time to get AA. Hopefully, they&#039;ll go back and revise the bots for all the games in series to be played from any side.

Of all the series, I found ADP to be the most difficult and involved in solitaire and tournament play where Cuba Libre was least. It is the only one with sudden death victory conditions in the solitaire game which can really make the game really difficult for some factions in some scenarios.

[q=&quot;often&quot;]I don&#039;t like the sudden death rules in ADP&#039;s solo game.
[/q]

And I made the fatal mistake of starting with ADP.  Just sold it recently because it was waaay too much and too subtle for me.  I&#039;m not put off of COIN completely, but the reason I got ADP was because I liked the theme, and I&#039;m not as interested in the others (though FitL is starting to look better).  

Funny enough, I did play one 3 player game of it, and the AA ended up winning on the third Prop card.  The other two wanted to kill me for bringing a game that was smarter than the three of us combined.

Live and learn.  The reviews said don&#039;t start with ADP, start with AA or CL.  My advice:  Listen to them.

It really is true. Like you say, there&#039;s a lot of subtly to playing the game. Too many people jump out to a big lead and get bashed, then mistakenly call the game a &quot;bash the leader&quot; game. There&#039;s so much counterplay and subtly to your actions. You need to make temporary alliances with other players knowing they&#039;re going to turn on you when it&#039;s to their advantage. 

You have to also advance you cause while not appearing to be a threat, so you can turn and take a turn or two to get ahead to the point that no one can do anything about it in time. Sometimes you even set someone else if as a threat so you can take advantage of the lack of focus on you. 

The COIN games are brilliant. ADP is my favorite. I love the interactions between the four factions. It&#039;s not quite as forced as FitL (though that&#039;s not a bad thing), and offers greater strategic depth than Cuba Libre and Andean Abyss.

The reason people suggest starting with Cuba Libre is because it&#039;s a smaller map, with smaller pieces. There&#039;s still a lot of options and choices. And decisions. But the decision tree is smaller as the map is very small and the time between the prop rounds is also shorter. It&#039;s a knife fight in a phone booth.

I don&#039;t know of one competitive multiplayer that isn&#039;t a &quot;hop on the top.&quot; In the COIN series, the penalties for not stopping a runaway are more dire. Likewise, the penalties for over prosecution of the leader are higher. One absolutely can not afford to blow one faction out of the game until the last campaign. Subtle shifts in the balance between factions mean a lot because the asymmetrical capabilities of the factions are required keep a lid on each other.

The first time that I played all the COIN series face to face was in a tournament. The experience with ADP was probably the least fulfilling of the group. I think that was probably because I played the Government and was on my second COIN game of the day. Of them all, ADP, which was the final, had the quality of trying to scratch your opponents with a knife when they were not looking while convincing them not take the knife away.  AA and CL had more of a &quot;lets you and him fight while I steal all your stuff&quot; feel. I found it easier in AA and CL to push the other factions into a box with each other like I&#039;d done with the bots in solitaire.

I feel the same way you do about ADP... Well, I agree with your assessment, but that&#039;s what draws me to it over the others! 

I think the government is the least interesting faction to play, though.

Well, there is this fine GeekList [geeklist=187244]HERE[/geeklist] where you could get players for these games.

Just sayin&#039;.

Heck, I&#039;d even play ADP again even though I sold my set.  I still have a pretty good grasp of most of the rules.

I think the government is the least interesting faction to play, though. [/q]Didn&#039;t really have a choice for the final. I think it was between the Taliban and the Government. I had always lost with the Taliban with the bots on the long campaign game, so I chose the Government. I figured I could stick really close to the Coalition and at least pull out a second by dominating the other two factions. At some point, I was planning stab him in the back before he could surge out for the win or make it such that he couldn&#039;t get out. But, the last prop card flipped early before he could escape, and I won. Sometimes, it&#039;s better to be lucky than good. 

But I do understand why you might think that Government is the least interesting faction. It&#039;s the only one where your ability to act is controlled by an another with dissimilar goals. You&#039;re not as independent as any of the other factions. The Coalition can drag you around, spend all your money, and limit your own freedom to act severely. I don&#039;t think the Coalition is as severely impacted by the lack of money. They still have the freedom to move and protect their gains while you can&#039;t do anything but play events, so you have to cooperate to some extent to stay competitive. 

At least in Fire in the Lake, the amount the US can spend of the shared budget is limited. They can&#039;t completely spend the ARVN out of action.

	<body>On the [geeklist=187063]Solo Arts Cow Geek List[/geeklist] I put up, [user=mo7189][/user] submitted [thing=37301][/thing]. I had never heard of it before but, as I looked at it, the system seems fascinating. The more I read, the more I liked it.

I ordered a deck from the current Arts Cow deal, but I couldn&#039;t wait for it to arrive. Besides I have plane ride coming up this weekend... I needed something to do. So I printing up a copy on card stock. I don&#039;t have enough sleeves but that&#039;s ok -- it&#039;s a temporary deck anyway.


[ImageID=2412819]

:thumbsup: Harder than it looks. Certainly more thought than at first glance. I like surprising depth in a game.
:thumbsup: Helps you see the patterns in the cards... like the Crown only has one suit which, in this game, becomes an important point.
:thumbsdown: Lots of luck involved

Good call, Mike.  The Decktet is a great system for traditional style solo games.  I have yet to win Adaman in about a dozen tries.

I like [thing=37097][/thing] a lot.  And [thing=39290][/thing] is cool too. 

Enjoy!

Moe -- 

based on your advice I tried a couples games of [thing=39290][/thing] and it&#039;s pretty good. Brainer than Adaman. My biggest problem in Adaman is that I can do well and then be left with Crowns in the Court and Aces in my Resources. :yuk:

I thought Jacynth would feel more like [thing=96703][/thing] (because you watch the city unfold) but it&#039;s not that immersive. However, there are tough decisions with it.

	<body>Well. After finally learning how to play this [article=18296604]correctly[/article] (Two packs come from the draw pile! :whistle: ). I decided I&#039;d break it out for my first &quot;real&quot; play. I was kind of nervous as to how I would do! I had grown confident in my veggie trading skills only to be shown that they were built on lies! Thankfully, it was only really one lie and now that that was fixed it did alter and slow my play (as one might guess). 

So, I scored a 17.6. Which I am very proud of. Glad to see that most of the veggie trading skills were worth learning as they proved very useful in this &quot;new&quot; game. 

I will say one thing about the &quot;old&quot; strategy (I like to call it my &quot;variant&quot;), I do like the advance planning that is required. If I&#039;m taking two packs from the offer, I can really manipulate the offer and make more lengthy decisions and I find that to be fun. It&#039;s why I got absurdly high scores too, but it does offer an enjoyable in-game experience. </body>

	<body>Still playing my way through the games I acquired with holiday cash and gift cards.

This time I&#039;ve broken out SotM for a whirl.

Took Wraith, Ra and Legacy up against Baron Blade in Megalopolis.

I was able to take down the Baron but only Legacy was left and he only had 3 HP&#039;s left.

The final kill was actually made by the environmental card with the train/subway on the loose.  The Baron had 5 HP and a Blade Battalion at full strength (5 HP) were the two targets with the highest HP during the environmental turn and therefore got run over and taken out.  I actually thought it was sort of funny.

I thought Wraith and Ha were pretty decent damage dealers but I&#039;m not sure I &quot;grok&quot; Legacy yet.  He seems to be more of a supporting character that occasionally does damage.  I don&#039;t remember him having any powers that do damage, just one shots.

Anyway I liked the game, especially how the environment is involved in it.  I was lucky and by mid game had two &#039;Police Backup&#039; cards in play so they kept plinking the Baron with 2 damage each turn.

[b]EDIT 2/17[/b]
Finally playing my second game.  Have Haka, Tempest and Bunker taking on Omnitron at the Mars Base.

This match is taking forever to finish.  Bunker got down to 1 HP but the Meteor Storm came out and I took a few rounds under it&#039;s protection to use Tempest&#039;s Healing Power and Bunker&#039;s Maintenance Shed to heal.

The heroes have some decent stuff out but the environment keeps getting in the way (Meteor Storm, Red Dust, Self Destruct, etc), mores than in my first game.

I am liking the game and handling all the modifiers doesn&#039;t bother me like it bothers others so I guess I am lucky there.

I did get the app but it doesn&#039;t seem to immerse me into the game as much as using the physical cards.

Now I&#039;m starting to look at the various expansions.  Goodbye $$$</body>

I have the base game plus Rook City, Shattered Timelines and Infernal Relics and a bunch of the promo packs (Scholar, Wastelands etc.). Once I filled the base game box (which is fully packed now) I have resisted any more expansions (so far at least).

I really enjoy this game and I too am lucky that I don&#039;t find it fiddly at all.

I have all the stuffs for this game.  Minus a few of the first promo hero cards.

But I bought the game when it was still the first edition with the super thin cards and the tiny box that couldn&#039;t really even fit the base game in it well.

It&#039;s a great game that I don&#039;t play near enough.  The app helps, but all the cool and interesting heroes aren&#039;t in the core set.

:thumbsup: Doesn&#039;t take too long to play (perfect for a weeknight).
:thumbsup: Somewhat moving rulebook...I appreciate that the designer dedicated each map to a unit that was involved in D-Day. (I admit I got a little teary when reading the dedication for the training exercise map.)

Suzy&#039;s description of this is spot on.

I know a lot of people were down on it when it came out, but as a solo game it really is pretty decent for a lightweight dice chucker that&#039;s not going to tax your brain.  There aren&#039;t a ton of decisions, but like other games that use dice, the reroll decision can be sort of important.  

Its fun and light.

Don&#039;t go in expecting Mage Knight, go in expecting something about the depth of [thing=89910][/thing], or maybe [thing=150658][/thing].

Some of the expansion maps are fantastic.  The double size ones (forget which one it was) were great and offered a few paths through the game.  Made for some more decision making, which is always good in a solo game.

Absolutely, there is a &#039;TAKE THAT&#039; element in solitaire :arrrh:

And of course, I never talk smack to the game during those moments. :whistle:

[b]What brought you here?
Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/b] 
I&#039;m newbie even if I&#039;ve lurked at the site for a long time.
In January I start made this GeekList (as a &#039;test&#039;) [geeklist=185156]The Lone Boardgamer[/geeklist]

Then

[user=SirWashington][/user]

comment an item with the link to the SGoYT of January and... here I am!

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
The first game I posted was D-Day at Omaha Beach and it was my second attempt to play it (I discovered today that I misunderstand one rule...).
I really enjoy the game but it hasn&#039;t hit the table as much as I&#039;d like.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I didn&#039;t know there were so much solo players out there! It&#039;s amazing and really exciting.

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
I love to browse the monthly list to discover new games to populate my long wishlist. And I feel part of a guild. A really big, enjoying, wonderful Guild.
I&#039;d like to write more and more but my bad english stops me to do that so I keep reading and lurking most of the time

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
... :cry:</body>

Just remember, your English is probably a lot better than our Italian (well, except for the other Italians...and probably most of the people who live in Europe.... what I&#039;m saying is that Americans don&#039;t know other languages, as a broad stroke generalization that can be wrong a lot).

So don&#039;t feel bad if something isn&#039;t the best grammar, doesn&#039;t make sense, or is phrased awkwardly or with simpler vocabulary.

I think I just described about 3/4 of my own posts with the previous sentence!  :)

Look forward to reading more from you!  DDaOB is a great game (though I did sell my copy, didn&#039;t play it enough), and I always love reading session reports.

Phew.  My first game I think I did this twice, then checked the rule, cursed and continued the game without that rule.  It would make things so much easier if you could drag artillery and tanks with you up the beach, but wouldn&#039;t make much sense.

The fact that you only misplayed one rule is impressive. Plenty of good people misplay rules in much simpler games. 

I hope to get my rule errors down to 0 before ten plays!

	<body>[size=24][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/b]

After getting back in to gaming at the end of 2013 and knowing it would be almost exclusively solo I spent ages looking at solo game posts here on BGG and other places. Watched some videos, etc. I came to this list a few times through google searches but I didn&#039;t really &#039;get it&#039; back then and passed it over. Too many games being played. I just wanted a few recommendations of games to get.

After a few months of playing I came back here (I think I read about it somewhere else on the site) and read the posts properly.  I then understood this was about sharing your experiences playing solo and I had been bursting to talk about mine but my wife, kids, family and friends weren&#039;t interested in how I had stormed a city or fought some genestealers.

I started writing some stuff and posting it. Some people seemed interested (at least it seemed that way) so I wrote some more and then got more and more involved.  Now I can&#039;t go a day without checking in to this small corner of BGG.
[b]
What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]

It was Legends of Andor, way back in those ancient days of February 2014.  I don&#039;t own it anymore.  I have had a high turnover of games in my first year and half of solo gaming (lack of space has been a key driver for this) and this didn&#039;t click with me.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]

Not particularly.  Within the first few days though of posting someone kindly helped pay for my first avatar.  Basically, sums up the place.  People do stuff for each other that is generous and surprising.

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]

I had a really hard time finding the toilets, which could have been embarrassing.

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]

It&#039;s the only place I really interact on the web and that&#039;s because of the people.  Their interest in my gaming, my interest in theirs and the friendly nature of the place.  You&#039;re all brilliant!
[b]
How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]

More than I expected but less than a second mortgage.  Hopefully, I&#039;ve calmed down a bit now. 
[b]
If you haven&#039;t been back since your first visit, how are you even reading this?[/b]

My wallet wishes I wasn&#039;t.</body>

That probably would help.  Or Mo(e).  Though I think one of the Mo(e)s is actually a Chris.  Or a Kevin.  Or maybe a Ryan.  But not a Gary.

[q]I then understood this was about sharing your experiences playing solo and I had been bursting to talk about mine but my wife, kids, family and friends weren&#039;t interested in how I had stormed a city or fought some genestealers.[/q]

This is the exact reason I think I enjoy it so much here.  My wife listens to my gaming stories, but I know she doesn&#039;t really care that much (she listens because she&#039;s an awesome person).  Sometimes she will come by the kitchen table and ask me about a game I&#039;m playing, especially if it looks like I&#039;m in deep thought, but I know she doesn&#039;t care.

My daughter, who turns 2 next month, basically comes to bother me into putting on the TV, or playing with her outside (can&#039;t complain that she&#039;s really active!).

So you chaps get to read my thoughts and complaints.  Though I haven&#039;t posted too much this month, I have played a few hands of Dungeon Crawler.

And my updated Myth cards should be coming in today.  Time to break that out again.

	<body>My first log for February is kind of a cheat, because it&#039;s an app-play. But, I&#039;ve been traveling a lot, and was sick last week. So not much play so far this month. I am going to do something about it this weekend though.

Got in a play with three Heroes: Legacy, Fanatic and Unity against Ambuscade in the Silver Gulch. It went really bad. I lost in pretty short number of rounds. I probably got Ambuscade down 10 points of health or something. This made me increase the Hero count for my next play. But still going for the &quot;this hero looks cool&quot;-tactic when choosing a team. </body>

I don&#039;t understand why people get so irate that other gamers log and report plays on an App.  Who cares if it&#039;s not physical, if it&#039;s the same game (in every way), then its the same game.  It&#039;d be like not logging vassal plays!

So, no cheating at all.  Hope you feel better and your travel schedule calms down.  I know I always get really sick when I travel a lot.

	<body>I have played 3 more games of [thing=126042][/thing] this week. I have chosen &quot;King&quot; as the difficulty level and played the B-sides.

[i]Game #1 with China: 31 VP
Game #2 with Egypt: 47 VP
Game #3 with Rome: 41 VP[/i]



:thumbsup: the B-sides...they give each nation a different character

:thumbsup: the variety of the cards

:thumbsdown: the randomness of the cards..if you want to play military a lot but there are no wars or no colonies in future turns..than your investments don&#039;t pay off and your game might go in a wrong direction

:thumbsdown: sometimes you feel you have not that many different actions...a few more stuff to do would be nice..maybe they add something to the game with their first expansion

Seriously i finished [thing=133038][/thing] in December and thought i would play other games before attacking S&amp;S.  So i have been playing alot of [thing=77423][/thing] and my new baby [thing=149951][/thing] both being great games.

Since December i was in a PACG S&amp;S organized play group but ther was something just not right with the S&amp;S pirate theme / class deck combo.  There was a big lack of theme in my deck. So i sadly deciding to leave the group.

This week i thought i would start S&amp;S since i already had purchased 4 adventures and was holding this back thinking it would be too much similar to RoR. And OMG what a great story so far.  This is very different then RoR if you know how to read and use the story written by [user=kittenhoarder][/user]

For sure if you just run through the game asap and dont take the time to get drawn into the story i bet all PACG game will feel similar but trust this is a great series.

Oh yeah and here is my team with 4 scenarios all completed with success.

Ha ha your first line reminded me of a cartoon I saw.  One golf guy says to his golf buddy, &quot;You can&#039;t really enjoy golf fully until you have a wife and kids.&quot; :cool:

Where is this kittenhoarder story of which you speak?  Is there one for RoR also?

	<body>So here go, my first SGoYT post!!

DotZ (2nd Edition) is currently on my table as I prepare to shoot my next episode of &quot;Hands-On Games&quot;. What? You haven&#039;t heard of my new gaming channel???  Most of the content is aimed at the solo-gamer so what are you waiting for, go subscribe!! :)

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLq5xIwl4xRgTfWalhCTNVQ

As for my latest session, all I can say is that I [i]really[/i] hate losing Pickles at the mine. You&#039;d think I would have learned by now, but no. :cry:

[size=18][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/size]

[b]What brought you here?[/b]
I think I found the SGoYT lists via a front page link maybe a year ago. Been lurking for quite a while.

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
This is my first post on SGoYT!

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I was eating a salad while making the post (crunch, crunch)

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
Likely upwards of $1000 or so by this point...

	<body>This game finally arrived from the big boat and I&#039;ve played it solo 10 times so far (it is part of my 10X10 challenge).
  
(all at normal difficulty)
Warrior + Cleric vs Demon Lord, Win
Cleric + Bard vs Colossus, Win
Ranger + Sorcerer vs Giant, Loss
Druid + Warrior vs Kraken, Win
Oracle + Sorcerer vs Dragon, Loss
Commander + Cleric vs Dragon, Loss
Warrior + Barbarian vs Giant, Loss
Warrior + Bard vs Kraken, Win
Commander + Cleric vs Colossus, Loss
Ranger + Sorcerer vs Demon Lord, Loss

I like filler games.  And co-op games.  And solo-playable games.  Every game has been on a razor&#039;s edge - the wins are barely, from-the-cusp-of-failure wins and the losses were soooo close.  With my &quot;likes&quot; and with the very close sessions, I &quot;should&quot; enjoy this game more than I really do.  I&#039;ve pondered this and think it is the random player activation mechanic.  Yes, it adds tension.  But it also makes it difficult to co-op or plan ahead.  Every one of the those games that were won, it was because the player activation cards came out early in the last round.  Every game I lost was because the activation cards came out late.  So, on the surface this should be an exciting session, but instead it feels a bit disappointing; it all comes down to how the cards are randomized on the last turn.  I really &quot;want&quot; to like this game, but so far it has been lackluster.

:thumbsup: Quick setup and play, different character abilities and boss monsters mix up the challenge

:thumbsdown:  Some decisions are obvious, randomized player turns feel lackluster, diminishes co-op elements</body>

so far this has been my conclusion as well.  On the other hand, it does take some thought to keep the game under control until then, and over the course of a game, some rounds will see activations in your favor and some against, so managing that could be considered part of the game.  

I thought this would be a pandemic or defenders of the realm killer, but seems it will fall short.

But isn&#039;t this how almost every solo game plays? Once you implement the most effective strategy and play the odds, it usually comes down to cards you draw or dice rolls.

Maybe in a shorter, lighter game the element of luck with the cards is just more obvious?

I can see how this may spoil the game, if it&#039;s so obviously dependant on the card draw that it seems like simply tossing a coin for a win or lose.

I was thinking of getting this, after Kickstarting [thing=163967][/thing] and reading a few positive reviews; not so sure now.

[q=&quot;nickbolton&quot;]But isn&#039;t this how almost every solo game plays? [/q]

True.  And with a game of Pandemic, for example, if that one city card comes up, it can spell doom.  If the wrong tile gets flooded in Forbidden Island, you can lose.  Etc.  When that happens with Pandemic or FI (or others), I feel like it was a great, close game.  But, for me, it seems unsatisfying with TED.    

I&#039;ve been pondering the difference and I think it is the mechanic of the epic foe coming out at the end.  You can&#039;t win the game until that tiggering event and once that happens, you have to neglect (to some degree) the defend/succor parts of the game, so it all comes to a head  at once.  You can&#039;t win (and seldom) lose before that, so I think the turn order at the very end seems more.. pronounced.. than in other games.

	<body>With the upcoming release of [thing=166679][/thing] I decided to break out this old chestnut (with the [thing=137479]Unseen Forces[/thing] expansion). Carolyn Fern (the psychologist) and Ashcan Pete (the hobo) trying to prevent the awakening of Tsathoggua.

[imageid=2414260 medium]

The two investigators started out strong, but eventually became undone by an adventure that added 3 doom tokens every midnight if there were any monsters on the board. Ashcan Pete was devoured trying to remove the last monster from the board, his failure leading to the awakening of Tsathoggua. Carloyn was on her own to face this ancient evil.

[imageid=2414261 medium]

Unfortunately Carloyn was also devoured with 5 doom tokens left on Tsathoggua. Sorry humanity, we are all doomed!

[imageid=2414262 medium]

Looking forward to the new mechanisms introduced in Gates of Arkham. 

:thumbsup: Moderately quick set up

I have a bunch of the Arkham investigator minis (enough to play (or proxy in a few cases) all of the investigators in Elder Sign (with both expansions) and Arkham (with Dunwich expansion)). I find they add a lot to my enjoyment of the game. The only ones I am missing (for the games/expansions I own) are (conveniently for FFG) the ones that are sold out but just &quot;happen&quot; to be available in Mansions of Madness. Thankfully there are other characters that are close enough that I can just proxy the missing ones for now (until my OCD drives me to buy MoM just for the minis).

As for music, I have a pretty extensive collection of early jazz, jugband music and tinpan alley/vaudeville stuff on vinyl that seems to work really well. Or I will break out some 12-tone stuff like Pierre Boulez which fits the non-euclidian creepy vibe of Lovecraft pretty well.

It is indeed atonal (atonal = not centered around a particular key). 12-tone music is composed around sequences of 12 tones instead of traditional keys. The pieces are centered around a phrase (or &quot;tone row&quot;) that contains all 12 chromatic notes (but from any octave). Composition involves combinations of the tone row including inversion (reversing the direction of the intervals between notes), using the retrograde (reversing the phrase), transposition and layering/sequencing of versions of the original &quot;tone row&quot;.

In a very different vein, one of my favourite pianists of all time is Abdullah Ibrahim (a.k.a. Dollar Brand). His medley of Mood Indigo/Take the A Train is mind blowing, but unfortunately not on youtube.

This is though:

	<body>Oooh! My printerstudio copy of this was waiting for me when I got home from work, and I&#039;m still spreading the cards around soaking up the quite astonishingly good artwork and flavour text/historical context. This isn&#039;t a solo game, but I&#039;ll be playing it two-handed, just to get a feel for the mechanisms, before teaching my wife. First impressions are hugely positive. Can&#039;t wait for Tristan&#039;s Fantasy Quest to achieve a similar tangibility. 

More thoughts soon.

Anywho... Navajo Wars found the table.  My first SGOYT induced purchase....

I fumbled about with the tutorial, which embarrassingly took 2 sessions, because I made sure that I could get every rule correct and understand every move, and I didn&#039;t have the stamina to do it in one session.

Finally I get the game to a point where I think I&#039;m ready to play... 

[imageid=2414328 medium]

I manage to get through the deck, managing what I hope is a mistake free game (rules-wise) and draw the final historical event...which just so happened to be the last card.

I truly had no idea if I was doing well at the beginning of the game, but I began to sense that I was getting my butt kicked towards the end... Not knowing was a bit weird.

I followed the instructions for the final victory check, and realized that I finished in a Major Defeat.

Ouch. 

However, I am glad it wasn&#039;t a victory.  It would have felt like a shot on the game if I won without really knowing what I was doing.  Unfortunately though, I&#039;m not sure I learned too much in terms of strategy... but this game intrigues me enough that I can see it staying on the table for a few more plays...

I plan on watching a playthrough to see if I find any rules errors, etc..

I do think the game is aesthetically pleasing, so I took a few more pictures with the &quot;real&quot; camera.  (The cat is just with the phone)

Edit: 2-18
Plays 4-6 are all auto victories against scenario 2: Los Duenos Del Mundo.  Time to bump to scenario 3 I suppose.</body>

We all win some and lose some.  Geekway is coming to town soon.  I will be able to dump it and recoup most of my loss (hey they would get assembled minis!) without shipping, but who knows...by then I might have tried it again and it clicked...

I&#039;ve gone 3 for the last 3 in auto victories against the Spanish (scenario 2) and I&#039;ve only played 6 games.  

[/q]

What was your strategy? [/q]

Hard to say.  I look for every attempt to reduce enemy morale. 

[o]Plan ahead for raids so that they fail (no capture and no build) every time.  This is typically achievable by putting a family with evasion +2 on the 1 spot of San Juan.

Take out missions as soon as you can, Don&#039;t worry about ferocity.  It will bump raids, but makes for a nice opportunity to ambush.  Save a low die Ceremony card for the enemy roll, and a high one for you own if you can.
[/o]
I am tempted to do a turn by turn session with my reasonings.  Maybe I will, and you might be able to glean some ideas from that, but I truly don&#039;t consider myself any kind of expert, maybe I&#039;ve gotten lucky.

The fruitless raid has led me to an automatic victory almost each time I&#039;ve played. I asked what your strategy was because I wanted to see if it aligned with mine.

Have you tried further scenarios?  I think that this is my next step before writing it off as solved...which I would hate to do.

Yeah, similar story here. I used the Culture family of cards to load up on APs and manage raids. As I&#039;ve said before, I&#039;ve &quot;learned to stop worrying and love the raid!&quot; for how I can use them to reduce enemy morale and either evade or  negotiate my way to safety.

That said, I haven&#039;t seen the rest of the game where I need to do more ambushing and combat, so I&#039;m assuming that even if I (we, it seems) may have discovered the optimal strategy for scenario 2, we&#039;ll find things different as we press on.

	<body>[b]UGH![/b]

Was on the final mission of the second scenario, when the villain decided to hide herself the second card from the bottom on the last location, so the Blessings Deck ended before my team could get to her.

:yuk: That a bad shuffle can make the whole night&#039;s quest pointless, always bums me out, for a game which I generally really enjoy.

Maybe, when this happens I&#039;ll remove one location on the next go through. I hate repeating quests just because the villains randomly land on the bottom.</body>

	<body>As I predicted, the mystery game is eating up most of my gaming time. I pushed late into the night and had my first play of this very unusual game.

I tried the solo variant listed in the rulebook with Captain Brix Berkwix. I didn&#039;t use any particular setup--I modified the 2-player setup for 2 rows by adding 12-8-12-8 cards. I think for the &quot;real&quot; solo game, I&#039;d want to use fewer cards to increase the challenge (tougher enemies and boss come sooner), but this was good as a learning game. To have the same number of rows as a multiplayer game, I&#039;d need to do 8-6-8-6. I ended with 1 Energy left and had: Engine 1, Rotary Cage 2, Generator 2, Laser 1, and Shield 1. 17 Glory.

It&#039;s too early to call this one. On the one hand, I spent a large portion of the game trying to remember if I&#039;d used my move yet this turn, looking up the different space thingies in the reference guide, and small things like that. That&#039;s not what I think of when I think of a scrolling space shooter! On the other hand, I got a lot more comfortable with the game toward the end, and I still have lots of different ways to try the game, including the unofficial cooperative variant, official solo scenarios, the smaller random deck I mentioned above, and oh yeah, multiplayer.</body>

Nice review Byron!
You signed up for the Single Player Scenario Testing a little bit too late, but after this effort of yours I will reward you with a single player scenario (check you inbox :goo:)
The scenarios are much more puzzly than just playing a one player KC game.
By the way, from the look of the upgrades you ended up with, it seems you played the game pretty defensive :)

Cheers!

Thank you! I will definitely be trying it next time I play. How secretive do I have to be? Can I post a session report here?

Yes, I was playing pretty defensively. I took the text in the rulebook seriously: &quot;Can you defeat the boss [b]without being destroyed?[/b]&quot; I took that to mean that if I got destroyed even once, I immediately lost the game! Also, near the end of the game, I would have bought another weapon instead of the Engine, but there was an Achievement available for 2 glory if I bought 3 ship mods. I take my glory seriously, too!

It does get a lot better when you can remember the space thingies!
And it doesn&#039;t take as long as you think. 
I still have issues remembering to do things, especially checking the achievements and missions.

However the game hasn&#039;t lost its replay ability yet! In fact I find myself playing it more often.

So... At the moment I am the master spammer :whistle:

But I just want you to have the opportunity to try single player scenarios for this game.

The blog is up and running for single scenarios!

We have posted the first scenario and are going to post new scenarios regularly. Check it out here:

	<body>Got this the other day and played my first game last night.

Train #1 L.A.D.A.S.
Sites -58
Track - 12
Contracts - 43
Train - 0
Surveyor - 1
Score - 114

Such simple rules but engaging turns! I really enjoyed my first game and that doesn&#039;t normally happen but the rules were so easy to remember I was able to be in the game the first time out.

I really like how the game ramps up the pace as you progress, it give the session real body.

:thumbsup: Easy to learn
:thumbsup: Strategies are apparent right from the start but deeper strategies unfold as you get more comfortable with the flow
:thumbsdown: While the card quality is very good, they are prone to arching which I find most linen cards are. Not a big deal though.</body>

Very good.  I especially like how you did the spiders.  The colors you picked just work for me.  The red mandibles definitely are a nice touch.


As for me, I just have the zombies left to paint.  Been sitting on my shelf primed and ready for almost a month.

Thanks. With my eyesight and steadiness of hand (or lack of), I can&#039;t achieve some of the brilliant results seen elsewhere, but I still find it satisfying.

My favourites are the terrors, which look like they&#039;ve got pustules of lava erupting from their skin.

Still got some washes to apply, especially on the worms.

	<body>Solo play with 2 mono-sphere decks (core set only).
Spheres: [b]Tactics + Lore[/b]
Scenario: [b]Journey along the Anduin[/b]

[b][i]Game 1[/i][/b] (without shadow card - 1 Gandalf by deck): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #10 (Lost Berevor and Thalin due to a combination of Necromancer&#039;s Reach and 2 Evil Storm) 
[b][i]Game 2[/i][/b] (without shadow card - 1 Gandalf by deck): [color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] turn #10 ; 90+48+44+6+4-11=181 points (That was very hard with 2 sniper on the staging area at the same time and 2 Gladden Fields on the end)
[b][i]Game 3[/i][/b] (with shadow card - 2 Gandalf by deck): [color=purple][b]Fail[/b][/color] (I simply forgot to deal shadow cards)
[b][i]Game 4[/i][/b] (with shadow card - 2 Gandalf by deck): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #7 (The East Blight as the active location and 2 Brown Lands in the staging and no monster to feed Legolas ability -&gt; game over on threat)
[b][i]Game 5[/i][/b] (with shadow card - 2 Gandalf by deck): [color=green][b]Victory[/b][/color] turn #9 ; 80+39+37+8-11=153 points (2 Brown Lands as setup, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible to have worse start. But it got better with a lot of Thalin&#039;s favourite food, crows)

Obviously, the starting thread of each deck are too high, which make them vulnerable to certain treachery cards from the encounter. So my 1 handed deck will be made with low starting threat. Normally it will be: Legolas + Thalin + Beravor for 26, but the willpower seems too low to handle the second par of the scenario.</body>

	<body>First SGoYT post...been lurking, thought I would throw something on the board!

[b]ORIGIN STORY[/b]

[b]What brought you here?[/b]
I was responding to a prospective solo-gamer recommendation thread about games that I have enjoyed, and someone &quot;hotlinked&quot; this list.  I followed, added to my &quot;want list&quot; and have since taken out a 2nd mortgage on my home and sold my youngest kid to fund my habit.

[b]What was the first game you posted?[/b] 
YES

[b]Do you still own it?[/b]
Yes, I will never let this one go, as hard as it can be to find.

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
I am setting up a solo run of [thing=121921][/thing] while typing this...well, not WHILE typing this, as I am not that coordinated.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
My wallet has shed a tear in anticipation...looking at a couple of new acquisitions in the very near future.

[i][b]Now...about [thing=1608][/thing][/b][/i]

I am 43.  If you can rewind the clock to the late elementary/early middle school days, hearken back to English class where we used to get the &quot;Weekly Book Reader Club&quot; order forms.  If you graduated prior to 1990, I am sure you recall that getting these was the pinnacle of your day when it happened.

[imageid=2414887]

I would instantly scan the books to find one of those &quot;Choose your own way&quot; books...you know, you would read the first few pages, then get to the bottom where you had to choose: &quot;If you would like to grab the controls of the smoking plane and attempt to fly it, turn to page 148, If you would rather jump from the plane with the makeshift parachute, turn to page 86.&quot;  Inevitably, I would die a few times, but eventually find the right route through the narrative maze to &quot;solve the book&quot;.

25 years later...

So I am playing excellent solo games like [thing=123955][/thing], [thing=62227][/thing], and [thing=121921][/thing]...but want something with a little more &quot;narrative&quot;...something that tells a story.  Someone on a random &quot;Hey, I would really like a great solo war game&quot; mentioned [thing=1608][/thing] as one of the pinnacle solo games, way ahead of its&#039; time in 1983.  Why didn&#039;t I buy this as a budding gamer in the 80&#039;s?  Because a friend and I decided to buy [thing=243][/thing], which was an adventure in its&#039; own right.

So, I searched out this little gem, paid a fairly decent premium for it to ensure that all of the chits were accounted for, the maps were in perfect shape, etc.  And once I learned the rules and began playing...fell in love.  Mix the heavy narrative of a &quot;Choose your own Way&quot; story, with individual soldiers with varied skills that could potentially survive and level-up (feeds the RPG&#039;er in my blood), SMART AI which react according to your movement, excellent fog of war mechanics, etc., excellent squad-based WWII combat, and I was hooked.  So highly recommended if you can score yourself a copy.

:thumbsup::thumbsup: Immersion!!! In spades!
:thumbsup: Fairly easy to read rules, which are implemented in layers over scenarios
:thumbsup: A great user-community ready to answer questions in minutes!
:thumbsdown: Somewhat hard to find, cost a fair amount to ensure completeness
:thumbsdown: There&#039;s no reprint!
:thumbsdown: Expansions are supposed to be fantastic, but are kind of hard to find, and may be cost-prohibitive to some people on a budget.

	<body>third try of the doomsday scenario - again on easy mode. 
this time i was very lucky again: 

first: useful planet distribution - i was able to concentrate my whole fleet comfortably at home which left only 3 planets undefendable should a doomsday machine arrive in an unfortunate location (which didnÂ´t happen):

it was a bit boring - next to none movement after having explored my sector of the galaxy - but i had a nice big fleet which didnÂ´t have any problems taking on the machines - here the final battle (VERY lucky dice rolls included):

	<body>Hello!

Okay, I finished the first test run for a randomized AI for this game. There are still some gaps and the AI is rather weak - which shouldn&#039;t be surprising, given that I am not really an experienced player of Dominant species. In the end, playing the arachnids, I won with 161 VP. The reptiles scores 124 VP while the mammals only reached 101 VP.

The basic idea for the AI seems to be fine, but the tables need some tuning and probably also a few more conditions. Each AI player needs 7 markers or cubes to show which sub table it has selected and which line it executes within the table. At the beginning of play, randomly select tables for the AIs.

 As such, AP placement uses the following rules:
If Domination and Initiative slots are vacant, roll 1d6: 1 - Initiative, 2-6 - Domination.
If Domination slots are vacant, place an AP on Domination
If all Domination slots are taken and that particular AI player has not picked a strategy for this round yet (which happens on its first turn where all Domination slots for that round are taken), roll 1d6 for a strategy. Move the cube on the strategy table next to the first line of the strategy.
If the current line of the strategy makes sense (e.g. Protect Endangered Species only makes sense if there are potentially endangered species), execute it, otherwise go to the next line.
Executing strategy lines usually results in consulting the tables below it, which also may change from round to round - a table that has not been used in a given round by a given AI player gets rolled on with a die that is larger than the number of tables available (so 1d6 would work for all tables except for Protect Endangered Species, for which I used 1d10 in the test run). Once a table is picked for a round, it is used like the strategy table, skipping things that would not work (like protecting an endangered species using abundance if there are no elements your animals can use available for abundance).

To mark which tables have been used, I put the cubes I use for markers on the tables in the top row of the selected table (where there are three squares). As stated above, during play, a die larger than the number of sub tables is used - if the result is higher than the highest number, the AI sticks to the sub table it used the last round. Sub tables are only rolled for when needed (that is, when a table is used for the first time in a given round). 

When picking options, AIs will select the ones benefitting themselves directly the most. If that is not applicable, they will pick those that have the biggest impact on the board, and if there is no significant difference, those that will harm the human player the most.

For Dominance cards, one additional golden rule is that the AIs pick AP cards first; if several are available, they pick the one that they would otherwise not benefit from.

Well, that is the basic idea. Here is also the cheat sheet with the tables I used.

[ImageID=2415029]

I probably won&#039;t get around to experiment with Dominant Species for a while, so there won&#039;t be any progress in the near future from me. But maybe it can inspire people or give ideas for AI development.

Wow, [i]Deathworks[/i] -- a brave undertaking, indeed.  And it looks like quite an initial effort!  

I&#039;ve been wishing for a viable solitaire variant for this game before I crack it open (it&#039;s still sitting there, unopened, on my shelf -- where it has been since Xmas), and this looks like a good start.  So once I do get into it, I&#039;ll definitely return here and more thoroughly check this out.  Maybe you should post this on the [i]Dominant Species[/i] &quot;Variants&quot; forum so it&#039;s easily found by those seeking it?

Hello!

Thank you. But it still needs some work, I think. Currently, the tables are mostly just putting the random results in a randomly determined order. To make it a stronger AI, those sub tables would require some more deliberate design, expressing certain approaches to reaching a given goal. Which would in turn require experience with what are good strategies and which are bad ones in the game - experience I am currently lacking (^_^;;

As it stands, it is maybe slightly more ordered than a complete random roller, but not much so.

Yours,
Deathworks

	<body>DM scenario on easy mode again. Small map.

My Home System was surrounded by minerals. Which was a very good thing. Soon I was richer than I expected I could be.

I didn&#039;t build any fighting ships until round 4. Colony ships and research was on the schedule. In round 3 I found a ship wreck which gave me +1 ship size.

My attack and defense were at +2 and +1 when the first DM finally entered the game. And it entered in the worst hex it could. 4 planets straight on it&#039;s way to my HS.

[ImageID=2415039]

I had build myself a nice little fleet which was hunting the beast. The DM was swallowing 2 planets on it&#039;s way to my HS in Round 8. I had to stop it.

[ImageID=2415040]

I took it down almost before it was able to shoot back. 5 hits! But it managed to take one ship of mine down.

My miner brought me a lot of minerals and since I had colonized a lot of planets I had rounds with 60+ resources to spent. I build some Space Yards and brought in more ships. When DM2 entered I was not afraid that I would fail to take him down.

[ImageID=2415041]

I had it down in no time. DM 3 entered in the same area and I had build myself even more ships to take the third one out. It was a bit harder since it&#039;s level is higher but with my massive fleet I handled it pretty good. Winning my first match! OSS!

:thumbsup: I love minis, but I adore markers! The more I play with markers the more I enjoy it.
:thumbsup: Finally my first win. Let&#039;s move on to the next level of the DM scenario.
:thumbsup: I am so happy with this game that I am already thinking of rating it. But after 4 games I think it&#039;s too soon. But the level of addiction I am already in is a big + for the game. Next month I will get myself the expansion.
:thumbsup: I found Arrakis! :D
[ImageID=2415038]
:thumbsdown: I had researched Carriers and Fighters this time but did not bring them in. Next time!

No name. Most of the planet names are taken from various Science fiction  TV shows, movies, or books. 

There are pictures floating around where someone give them name/used images from various places already.

There are empire advantages in close encounters which technically are named, but it&#039;s names like Giant Race or Scientists rather than Ferengi or Vulcans. 

EDIT: The names are also attached to the advantages rather than to the different coloured counters.

	<body>Libya 1984. Cut off.

Again I played with random squadron selection and drew two A10s, the F16 and all three A1s. Thanks to the additional 4 SO points I also felt that I could stretch to two scouts so I had a pretty strong looking squadron. I also randomised pilot experience (while still observing the one-up-one-down rule) and felt that I had a pretty good mix of skills.

The campaign played out like a bit of a dream. I was destroying every single battalion that I attacked and even splashed out on three SO points to call in a B52 to take down the always threatening enemy infantry formation. My aircraft did accumulate some damage along the way so I was flying some pretty beat up birds by the end. The campaign also took its toll on my pilots as their stress limits got pushed to the max.

The one downer came on day 3 when Gator (flying his Cobra) got killed by a pop-up helicopter. It was pretty galling because I had been taking a rather unnecessary risk at the time and I had not lost a pilot in any of my previous campaigns. I chose not to replace him or his aircraft because the Cut Off situation imposes a higher cost to do that and I figured I could cope without a third a Cobra. Had one of the Hogs gone down that would have been a rather different matter.

Going into the final day I only had one enemy battalion left (!) but it was a big nasty Command battalion bristling with every conceivable defence. With no other targets it was a pretty easy decision to throw my whole squadron against it but even then I had an uneasy feeling about it. Had I been feeling a bit more prudent I would probably have abandoned the mission but I figured that it is, after all, just a game. And I wanted to see what would happen.

As it was I chose to arm my aircraft with as many cluster bombs as I could manage. I had some good strike bonuses and with so many enemy to attack it seemed a certainty that there would be plenty of hexes with multiple targets. While this proved to be the case, I really didn&#039;t take enough stand off weapons to neutralise the AA threat early enough. Although I managed to steer clear of the worst of it my opening turns were really hairy but I managed to limit myself to light hits for the most part. This kept me flying but my pilots&#039; stress levels were starting to reach their limits. Ultimately I just about managed to wrestle control of the situation and I bugged out as soon as I&#039;d done enough to destroy the battalion. It had been a bruising final encounter but it was good to come through it without any further losses.

And so my campaign ended with every single battalion destroyed and with my final score comfortably in the &#039;great&#039; bracket.

On reflection I do think the 4 SO bonus for random squadron selection is way too generous. I had thought the same after my last game and now I am sure of it. I think in future I am going to deny myself those bonus points because I will welcome the additional challenge, I think.

I&#039;ve had TAL on the table for a month now so it is time to give something else a bit of attention. Still, it&#039;s been a fun few weeks and I will look forward to the next time it hits the table.</body>

	<body>[b]Origin Story[/b]

[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/b] I got into gaming a few years ago, but a year ago I went back to school to work on my doctorate, which has seriously cut into my game time. I started looking for solitaire games and stumbled onto the 1 Player guild.
[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b] You are looking at it. Though I have been lurking around here for ages, I have only recently decided to try to get more involved in the guild, since I miss the camaraderie that comes with playing games.
[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b] We will find out.
[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b] No money yet, but I assume that will change, which will be fortunate for my gaming and unfortunate for my bank account.


I recently acquired Mage Knight and got in my first play this morning while doing laundry. I ran through the First Reconnaissance scenario. 

:thumbsup:I am sure that I missed a few rules here and there, but I enjoyed it immensely. 
:thumbsup:It definitely took a few turns before things started to click, but it was well worth the learning curve.
:thumbsdown:The setup is definitely a bit of a pain in the neck.
:thumbsdown:My table is barely large enough for the game (and I have to get pretty creative), but that is more a problem with the table than the game as far as I&#039;m concerned.:)</body>

	<body>Having played the official extra layouts for a 10x10 entry, I am now working thru the fan-made layouts.

[b][i]Atoll of Apprehension[/b][/i] - Navigator &amp; Diver. Lost; Unclaimed Treasure Sank

...Flood Level was 4.  Up till now things were going well, the Fire &amp; Water treasures had been secured, but 1 Earth temple had sank.  The Navigator held the tokens for the Earth treasure and was adjacent to the remaining Earth temple.

The Diver took his turn - nothing special.  During the Flood phase, he drew the last 2 flood cards, the Earth temple plus one - reshuffled for the other 2... and re-drew the Earth temple again.  [i]Unfortunately the Diver&#039;s ability only allows him to swim over sunken tile to get to land - he can&#039;t swim down to sunken temples.[/i]

[b][i]Bermuda Triangle[/b][/i] - Engineer &amp; Pilot. Won.
Fools Landing and 3 of the temples were in the SW corner.  Both Fire Temples were the last 2 tile in the SE corner, with the Copper Gate (Engineers start point not far away).  The Fire treasure was collected early.

The Pilot worked hard to shore up the key locations in the SW corner.  However with an early Water Rise card, the SW Earth temple sank - the remaining being the Northern most tile.

The Pilot headed North, via the Engineers location to collect the Earth tokens he was holding.  The Engineer headed to the SW corner to use his double-shore ability.  It took more turns than felt comfortable to recover the other treasures - by which time most of the island was either sinking or had sunk; the flood pile was low and Fools Landing card hadn&#039;t come out yet.  

In the final turn the Pilot grabbed the last treasure and flew to Fools Landing with one Helo Lift in hand.  Luckily the first treasure drawn was a 2nd Helo Lift, so the Engineer was helo&#039;ed in and the take-off order given.

[b][i]Baleful Bluffs[/b][/i] - Engineer &amp; Explorer. Lost - Fools Landing Sank.
A game which didn&#039;t need to be lost. Fools Landing went under water on the 2nd turn - and the Explorer, at least - if not both, was in range to shore recover Fools Landing but didn&#039;t.  The game then them a lesson with an early Waters rise and an unfortunate shuffle causing Fools Landing to sink, leaving the team stranded.

:thumbsdown: Re-playability out of the tin could be limited with only 1 layout.  [i]The extra official layouts have been mentioned as being in the German Edition.[/i]
:thumbsup: Lots of fan support for this; extra layouts, characters, tools (as treasure cards) and rules for missions or gaining boosts from the treasures collected.</body>

	<body>1. [2/14] This is a great little game, somewhat similar to [thing=442]Um Reifenbreite[/thing] in its basic play, but definitely containing a number of features of its own. A variable course, which isn&#039;t completely known at the beginning of the game, is unique, AFAIK in bicycle racing games. It also has a drafting/slipstreaming method which adds an element of luck unusual in the genre, at least as far as I&#039;ve explored it. For a pocket sized game, it packs a lot of theme into it.:surprise: I&#039;m looking forward to the next two plays in my [listitem=3613646]33 x 3 Challenge.[/listitem].

2. [2/15] My second play through the game confirmed my earlier experiences. This is a very good game contained in a deceptively small package. As I note in the comment below, it looks like one where a solitaire variant could be adapted from a similar game. That would make it an even more useful portable product. The only downside is the small size of the components which can be challenging to shift without jostling. They also distribute themselves widely when the cat hits the table. :cry:</body>

Is there a solitaire variant included or have you made up a variant of your own?

There is no solitaire variant that I&#039;m aware of. There are a couple for [thing=442]Um Reifenbreite[/thing]/[thing=442]Homas Tour[/thing] that it would be interesting to adapt for this game which overlaps in many of the basic concepts. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have time to look into it before Spring, but [i]Windschatten Pro[/i] sounds like a good project.

For now I&#039;m just playing all four teams and doing my best to give each rider the best shot possible. I&#039;m often surprised by which one ends up winning, so I must be keeping fairly honest. :D

	<body>It&#039;s not War of the Ring, but does it solo better and give a similarly epic Tolkeinesque experience?

I&#039;ll know more after I play past two turns. :whistle:

[b]Update:[/b] First impression time!

:thumbsup: Another attractive game graces my table. The map is particularly striking. I can see the units marching across the fields and holing up in the settlements. The minis, tokens, dice, etc. are all nice as well.

:thumbsup: Rules are straightforward and I only found myself checking the rulebook in the interest of getting everything right. Once you nail down the flow of a turn, it&#039;s all very simple.

:thumbsdown::thumbsup: I&#039;m not sure how I feel about having a general &quot;event&quot; deck (drawn by both sides) and faction-specific &quot;story&quot; decks. I really like how WotR has completely separate cards for the two sides, even if some of the functionality overlaps.

:thumbsup: While the battle system initially felt slow and cumbersome, I came to realize that by adding a bit more meat to the process, it really gave each battle narrative significance. Every assault on Dale was memorable BECAUSE it wasn&#039;t just one simple roll to see which side won or lost.

So unlike WotR in which you are balancing military strategy with navigating the ring to Mount Doom, this game is all about the combat. This is not a bad thing as there are many leaders involved, each adding their own flavor to the proceedings. You also deal with things like terrain, delayed deployments, and a damage system that forces you to really weigh when and where to mount your assaults. Sometimes, it&#039;s better to let the army come to you because you know you&#039;ll have the upper hand on that terrain.

I wasn&#039;t able to finish the game because my wife has actually said she wants to try and play Twilight Struggle again tomorrow so that&#039;s getting set up before I go to bed to maximize time during my daughter&#039;s nap. It might be awhile before I return to this, but I think it was a good addition that will make for a few good solo sessions and hopefully several plays with my buddy who loves the Hobbit.

ADDENDUM: I should note that while comparisons to WotR are inevitable, this game really is its own beast.</body>

Just making myself ignore the fact that I know what the other guy has.

I&#039;m sure that like WotR and many other 2-player designed games, this will be much more satisfying with another brain across the table, but watching the spectacle unfold is pretty great.

	<body>It has been a busy and stressful month so far, I just don&#039;t have the time or energy to play the brain-burners that I usually enjoy (I miss Omaha Beach and Iron Bottom Sound). So I pulled this out. I still like it as it is fast, fun, sets up easily, and has a small footprint. Still one of my favorites, hopefully Silent Victory will be out before the end of millennium. 

I&#039;m using the awesome Commander cards from [user=auy2k][/user] and so far I rolled 1&#039;s on all damage rolls sinking 21,600 tons in September 1939. </body>

	<body>Played some more Pathfinder a couple times today, with a match of [thing=30549][/thing] in between.

Finished off the evil Medusa witch, [i]finally,[/i] after the first time the Blessings deck going empty. The next match versus the Ogre mother...

[IMG]http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/25573344.jpg[/IMG]

...became a fight of attrition. Valeros had to fight her off 3 times, when he finally put the Mammy Graul to rest.

[IMG]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LfI5KQ-hxms/UchpPkUQnBI/AAAAAAAAA28/jacD6KGLNSA/s1600/MammyGraul.jpg[/IMG]

In the process, Kyra got some Elven plate armor and some better Blessings, she also took the +2 Spear from the Medusa chick.

Ezren took the Medusa mask, just in case he runs into another spell immune golem.

:thumbsup: Have I mentioned how addictive this game is? Because once I start, I end up wanting to go on endless adventuring.
:thumbsdown: The draw of no win/no lose, when you run out of Blessings is kind of weak.

:thumbsdown::thumbsup:  There&#039;s a lot of balancing odds in this one. Sure you draw a card and roll some dice, but more often than not, you need to balance your options for the best chance. [thing=146021][/thing] for me is almost total random, but Pathfinder controlling your hand lessens a lot of the &#039;pure&#039; luck of the game.</body>

Mammy Graul gave me a lot of trouble. That was one of the few scenarios that I &quot;lost&quot; several times (by running out of blessings) before I finally beat it. The whole &quot;the first time you defeat this villain, the villain is undefeated&quot; thing really ups the difficulty--you end up losing blessings from the blessing deck when she escapes, which can be really bad if there are a lot of open locations. And it&#039;s even worse when you aren&#039;t able to beat her on your first try, so you end up having to fight her 3 times or more.

I hate her stupid fat face. :yuk:

	<body>Hello!

Well, I finally purchased this GMT title as well and finished my first match against the Donald. It took much longer than I would have expected, and about halfway through, it became obvious that I was seriously outclassed. In the end, Donald scored 202 prestige points, while I was glad to reach at least 126 (I was worried I would have more than 100 points less than him).

Somehow, in mid-game, the events really came pounding me - while I was mayor, all the things occurred that would result in point loss for the mayor unless ransom was paid - by myself as regularly my buildings were threatened. I probably lost 30 or so prestige points during mid-game.

I was also unlucky that the reshuffle card for the planning deck was the bottom card of the planning deck - however, I had not been paying too much attention to the cards&#039; flavour as there were so many rules to watch out for.

Despite all those hardships, I really like this game. Personally, I think its usage of cards is much better than in [thing=62219][/thing]. I really love that the trigger events are in the middle of the card stacks, ensuring that you will not see all cards in a single session (too bad that the planning deck failed me in that respect (^_^;; ). 

While I rushed past the flavour because of the mind-boggling first experience, I see that there is a lot, not only in the events, but also in the individual buildings. Too bad that there is no expansion with individualized building tokens (you know, a zoo token that really looks like a zoo).

[b]Likes:[/b]
+ Quite some randomness - The cards really dictate what you can do at a given time, and they also generate lots of action besides the building of the actual buildings (elections, payouts, events)
+ Incomplete runs - For me, it is important that a game using cards or similar flavoured randomizers does not deplete all those cards in a single session. Even if you really work hard, at least 15 metropolis cards will not be seen in any given session.
+ Flavour - It is hidden as the tokens do not look impressive, but it is there.
+ Street names - Yes, this was a positive when I looked at the game board. It is part of the flavour, but their adding it is worth extra mentioning.
+ Useful board design - The board layout may be a problem when playing with 3+ players, but for solitaire gamers, it is really ideal. All the cards go onto the board, so you don&#039;t need to find extra space for those card stacks.
+ Lots of action - When your turn ends, often the real action starts as the cards used to replace the used ones can trigger various effects.
+ No hidden information - Yep, there is not a single bit of hidden information (safe for the order of cards in the stacks, of course). So, playing a solitaire variant does not need to mess around with that.

[b]Undecided[/b]
+- AP - There is a lot of potential of Analysis Paralysis as you have to make the best of very limited resources.

[b]Dislikes[/b]
- Takes very long - Even my quick run took several hours (okay, having to check rules adds to it).
- Lots of small rules - There is nothing really complex there, everything is in the open. But there are so many small pieces working together. When you build a building, you have to get enough permits with the correct zone code, pay the block value, meet the zone restriction rules, meet any special conditions on the card, gain prestige points for neighbouring buildings of the same zone type, may gain and thereby score one or more vocations, execute the card effects, and remember that you have the district atourney who doubles the prestige you get for neighbouring zones, when applicable :) :).
- Quite a bit of US flavour - Not a big dislike, but something that feels rather weird from a Central European perspective. Wilderness at the edge of a city can be seen as forests or maybe woods, yes, but having an airport event to move from town to city? (^_^;; Not really a problem, but something I noticed.
- Lots of recalculations - During most elections, you need to calculate the value of blocks to find the most expensive building of a given zone type. And believe me, it is quite easy to miss one of those markers during those calculations (^_^;;

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

	<body>Latest VPG acquisition; another excellent title from the little game company that could do no wrong. I played a basic game, with events, two-handed competitive, just to get the main feel of the game down, but with an eye on the adaptations necessary for the solitaire variant. 

Gorgeous components, once again, and another really engaging and unusual theme. There&#039;s a few tweaks to be had, dependant on player-count, regardless of solo mode, and I was initially concerned that the yellow player, who put on a couple of early shows, took and confidently held the VP lead - even when blue far outstripped him in how infamous his shows were becoming. The game actually seems really nicely balanced; the better player (blue) cinched it on points, right at the end - which seemed fair and right. I love the thematic event cards (you draw five, randomly, per game). If two economic depressions hit, though, the game ends immediately, and the winner is decided on points at that time. This is really rare, I would say, given the randomisation and, instead, I simply chuckled my way through starving fat ladies, desperate for food; an animal stampede; the clowns all getting alcohol poisoning through some dodgy hooch. (What can I say, I have a strange sense of humour.)

Ricky Royal does a great play-through of the dedicated solitaire game, which I&#039;ll be looking at intently next time.

Another winner, it seems.

I loved the theme of this game, but I personally found the solo game fairly easy and just parted with it this week.  I liked the hand management in the game and figuring out the best logistics to a location only to complete a show and pull another event in the opposite direction from where I was headed.  For me it was a strong 7 solo, and multiplayer sadly was never experienced.  Looking at your photo definitely makes me wish I had gotten one last play.

I gave this a 3 for solo. Just didn&#039;t have the urge to play it. 

Not a bad game, but always at the end of my to play pile.

Ended up with 17-8, but I did something wrong at the very beginning. Because the harvest fields didn&#039;t match up with the timing of the home field. Will have to read the rules again to see where I errored. :(

Well, now I&#039;m impressed.

To score a 17-8 in the solo mode with an early-game dearth of regular customers, while cheating yourself out of a field along the way, is a pretty good accomplishment in my book.

	<body>Hello!

Yes, I finished another session. 

Still, the game takes too much time. I think I will try the shortened variant suggested in the rules. This should also help a little bit against the over-powering AI. Donald defeated me 221 to 153.

The one thing I noticed is that the game requires a lot of concentration. Probably more than [thing=96848]Mage Knight[/thing]. There are simply so many things to keep track of.

Anyhow, this time, things got really weird as the &#039;11&#039; and &#039;12&#039; payout markers entered the game rather early - and the 12 was opposite to the 2 while the 11 was opposite to 5/6, creating a 30 point block as well as some other valuable ones (having &#039;7&#039; opposite to 2 as well made matters even more extreme). Donald quickly claimed the lots in those expensive plots while I simply didn&#039;t have the funds. Accordingly, he got most politicians, although I was able to keep the treasurer and the mayor from him.

I also played a slight variant as far as tracking was concerned. Instead of tracking his wealth (I used the bills to do that beforehand), I immediately changed 10 wealth into 1 prestige for Donald whenever he had at least 10 wealth. This was quite interesting, as the flow of the game became more apparent. This also meant, of course, that I realized relatively quickly how Donald got up and left me behind (^_^;;

Wow, a 30 point block is tough to deal with. Good job on keeping Treasurer from him in that case. All you can do there is wait for the cards to come out that let you build over his stuff.

I played the Rum Punch scenario and it punched me back. I&#039;m playing this set with Jirelle and Feiya. Ran out of time (blessing card deck ran out) before we could finally defeat the big baddie. Probably should&#039;ve closed that one location instead of loitering around looking for more allies and items.
I left things set up so I could give it another go before the weekend is over.
I still enjoy the Pathfinder card games (more than some other games I don&#039;t have any longer). :)

Added 2/16/15: Played 2 more times today and still haven&#039;t beaten it.

Added 2/18/15: Finally beat the Rum Punch! Got some great rolls (and a few clunkers). Came down to the last blessing and the final villain, but I had 8 allies to back me up!</body>

That Pathfinder Card Game is more than interesting to me. But the german version has a terrible card quality I heard.

	<body>I am unfortunately sick so I have been poring over the SoloPlay rules for Terra Mystica. Since I&#039;m learning the game alongside learning the SoloPlay variant I&#039;ve experienced a learning curve that is [i]especially[/i] curvy. 

I&#039;ve played twice, the first aborted because I didn&#039;t understand the costs associated with improving the worker to shovel ratio, the second completed on easy mode to a game victory (one rank above &quot;easy game victory&quot;).

So far as I can ascertain, the Witches faction confuses the AI. Instead of creating a cohesive large combined town, it attempted to follow me on the board as I plopped down dwellings willy nilly all over the map. Although this behavior did effectively keep me from forming another town, so I guess that&#039;s good for the AI still.  I had to concentrate all my efforts on just making the one town before the AI&#039;s &quot;terraform within two shovel types&quot; reaction broke my fragile town structure. 

I&#039;m sad that I only built the one town, but I grabbed the one with 9 VPs. (You only get 3 possible town tiles at the beginning of the game.) 

The end game scoring is a little bit different considering that the two neutral opponents gang up on you in terms of scoring, and there are multiple bonuses applied as well if you can achieve them. 

More than other SoloPlay variants I&#039;ve tried, this one both gives limited set up player choice that really helps shape the rest of the game. Had I not chosen the two scoring tiles that boost dwelling VPs, and chosen them to happen early on, I would have lost. I&#039;m not as sure on the bonus tiles, as I removed the 6-dollar one before shuffling and randomly selecting the five bonus tiles to use, because I wanted to prioritize everything else.

I upgraded to a stronghold as soon as possible, but it was difficult to upgrade in general. There are so many levers to pull that I had difficulty determining exactly which ones to use every round. Terra Mystica is a very meaty game, no matter its incarnation. 

One thing I did do is that, towards the end, when your opponents run out of actions, they start attacking you on the cult board (basically placing priests, but only if they can change the lead). And if they can&#039;t succeed there, you just start losing 2 VPs per reaction. 

Yeah, ow. After I was nearly out of stuff to do and the -2 VPs started hitting I quit while I was ahead. I&#039;m pretty sure that also contributed to the normalish win on easy mode with the easy faction. 

I&#039;m going to try harder factions next, but maybe after some Formaggio with Viticulture/Tuscany, or possibly something else, but now I need to rest some more so I can actually get better. </body>

Playing Through the Movies: Alien[/floatleft][floatleft][u][b]Role[/u][/b]

g{Victory}g[/floatleft][/floatleft][clear]

[u]Game #1:[/u] FINALLY got around to playing this one, and I&#039;m impressed. Even though I like the theme for Marvel a lot more, the game mechanics in this one are much better in my opinion. I decided to play through the movies and started with the first one. I randomly chose Technician as my role. I breezed through it pretty easy and halfway through objective 2 paused to reread the instructions to make sure I was doing nothing wrong. Turns out I wasn&#039;t, so it&#039;s either beginners luck or past Legendary experience. I&#039;m going mostly with the later. Of course, once I got to the the 3rd objective is when things got heated and I started to worry. I dud pull out a victory in the end. I really like this one.
[o]I mostly used the card that lets you possibly kill the top card of your deck, to weed out the basic cards. Also, You have your orders, followed by Teams of Three, is a very strong combo. (providing of course you get one more same team card) I wound up getting two 7 cost cards that way.[/o]

[b][size=24]Origin Story[/size][/b]

I keep forgetting to add my origin story to my posts, so here a short version. I was a lurker back when it was a once a year thing. I was going to get involved, but I had a feeling I would possibly forget, and I liked playing solo games all year long so I never participated. Once I found out SGOYT became a monthly thing, I joined in. [listitem=2751895]Here is my first ever post.[/listitem] It was for [thing=40209][/thing] and still to this day I have yet to get around to playing the Eagle side. </body>

Luck is more of a factor when playing only one Avatar, but generally you will find it reasonably easy and only a really poor card draw will offer you any resistance.
This game doesn&#039;t scale well for the number of players.
One player is easy and five player is nearly impossible.
Three players seems to be the sweet spot but due to table space I usually only play with two Avatars and put two or three Hive cards into the complex, before the start of the game. This seems to provide an exciting game with a little uncertainty but no desparation! :D

I have played solo once with Five Avatars. It took a little longer but the adrenaline rush was fantastic. 
It felt like playing DOOM PC in Nightmare! mode.

Yea, three tends to be my sweetspot in most coop games. I was just doing one for now to get used to the game mechanics, but thanks for that incite! I will definitely consider all that with my next game. I was already thinking about playing more than one just based on the fact that I was missing out on the Coordinate mechanic. I was also even thinking of adding some advanced rules like the Alien Player and play it the best I can to try to prevent my win with heroes. Maybe even agendas too with the extra rule of not knowing what they are until revealed.

	<body>A package arrived on Thursday, and another on Saturday, bringing many fine goodies:

[imageid=2417143 medium]

I have been very busy all week with the &quot;mystery game,&quot; but that ended today and I got to look forward to playing some other games. My wife went to bed early, and I decided what the heck, I&#039;ll give XCOM a shot.

I played the tutorial mission and performed ABYSMALLY. From the first round forward, I kept overspending and having my interceptors shot down in combat. The game ended on the third round, with a score of -45!

I did really enjoy the game, though, and look forward to exploring it more. There are two major cons to solo play. One is that the board is clearly designed for 4 players, so no matter which way you rotate it, something will end up in a less-than-ideal position. I played with the base defense/mission side facing toward me, which seemed like the most crucial area to be able to access, but that meant the world map was rotated 90 degrees.

The other con is that there is just SO much to keep track of with all the cards and tech providing special abilities (especially the ones that apply to the timed phase). I think the game would definitely reward carefully reading through these cards and trying to memorize them as much as possible.

Overall opinion, though, was positive.</body>

From what I have read about XCOM, it really seems like it would be a really fun game.  However, it also seems like it would be a massive nightmare to play solo!

Looking through the forums after the game, I did play a couple of things incorrectly, which added to the difficulty.

1) The rules state that &quot;For each UFO remaining in orbit, increase panic in the continent with the lowest panic by 1.&quot; This is really poorly worded, in my opinion. I played it that you selected 1 continent and moved it up by 1 for each UFO. Apparently, what they MEANT is that the first UFO moves the least panicked continent 1 single space, then the second UFO moves the least panicked continent (which may have changed) by 1 space, and so forth. BIG difference between moving 1 continent up 8 spaces and moving 3 continents 2 or 3 spaces each.

2) When you play a card that saves an Interceptor or Soldier from being killed, you can keep rolling for that task as long as the unit remains assigned to the task. I played it that a &quot;LOSS&quot; result killed your units and ended the task, so even if you save the unit, you can&#039;t continue rolling. Again, it could have made a difference.

3) This is not an incorrect rule, but I did forget to use my timed abilities some of the time--lots of time pressure!

	<body>I finally did my first test game. Set up time alone took me 50 minutes.

[ImageID=2417156]

[ImageID=2417157]

And that&#039;s before the first reinforcements arrive. Wow!

I only played 1 round. There were already too many questions I had that needed to cleared. Anyway I wanted to go through the movement and fighting procedure and I did it. Many ??? but they will be cleaned out soon.

:thumbsup: Anyway, I think this can be a lot of fun. Placing the units alone had me in tactical mode in no time!

:thumbsdown: In solo mode you can only play the Axis? :shake:
:thumbsdown: I need to get some plexiglas! The map just won&#039;t hold still.
:thumbsdown: My markers have a bad quality! Take a look:
[ImageID=2417155]
The corners from this one were ok, they just needed to be cut away but the paper went straight off. The rest of the corners took a good time to get them in a good shape. There was not a single corner which was clean after the marker was released. I never had something like this. Some corners were ruined after I punched them out and I had to round them a little bit. They looked really bad or the paper was about to get off. I wonder how long these markers will be playable.
I bought the game second hand but unpunched. I don&#039;t know how the previous owner stored the game...

Ok more :thumbsdown: than :thumbsup: but that doesn&#039;t matter. It was a test game and the bad quality won&#039;t stop me from bringing it back on the table. I only need to find a cat-protected place where I can leave the game. This is no fast game. After I studied the rules again I&#039;ll bring it back.</body>

Some markers don&#039;t belong to the same army but it&#039;s hard to separate them. Almost the same colors etc.

I wish the fall of Berlin was done in a simpler fashion. I&#039;ve kept this game because of the rarity of the theme but I have yet to get it to the table. I guess it&#039;s time.

	<body>After a (much too) long hiatus from my table I set this up yesterday after I put Rallyman away.  Thanks to the others posting SE4X this month I was inspired to dust this one off.  

I have never played the Alien solo scenario and have that on my goals list for 2015 so I&#039;ll get to cross that off soon. I&#039;m currently set up against 2 Alien players. I clipped all of these counters last month and they are looking pretty sharp. ;)

Now I just need to refresh myself on the rules and learn how to operate the Alien opposition.

[b]2/19[/b]
This wasn&#039;t very tough to relearn at all and the AP rules weren&#039;t too hard to grok either.  I set up an easy scenario for my first try so it was against 2 AP (Yellow and Green) who I had to defeat before they combined their forces and became a massive Blue empire. (Actually, they weren&#039;t friends at all, they were from totally different parts of the galaxy, never really met each other and had little in common.)

I did not keep any session notes for this game since I was concentrating on relearning the rules and learning how to work the AP players.  I did have some confusion about determining if they were launching raider fleets or not and some other minor quibbles so I&#039;ll have to do a comprehensive read through of their rules again and maybe some forum skims before I go again.  I&#039;ll also have to up the difficulty level - though they did take me to turn 19 before I wrapped things up.

Green got off to a strong Tech start before it started accumulating Fleet and just a dab of Defense. Yellow had grabbed a few economy boosts early to help it along in later turns and made more Defense rolls early on as well.  Yellow was the first to launch a fleet at me, this happened in turn 4 and it was just a tiny 10CP fleet though it did force me to divert some resources to meet the attack. Green didn&#039;t launch a fleet until turn 8 and it was just a 10CP fleet as well (but boy did they have fancy gadgets).

I had shipyards set up on the outlying colonies so I could move more quickly to intercept incoming threats.  I started by building a small force at each location but quickly realized that it was much better to combine my forces to overpower the enemy.  I had built up my move tech to level 4 which I felt was good enough and was able to keep the small AP fleets from causing trouble.  The AP players both failed Move tech rolls the entire game - this really helped.

About half-way through I realized that Yellow was kind of falling behind on Fleet but had built up 50CPs for defense.  I decided to go after them first. After they launched a 75CP fleet in turn 12 I met them on turn 13 and then continued on to their home world.  They managed to get another fleet out in turn 14 (40CP) and then revealed a massive amount of mines as their home defense - unfortunately, I had low SW tech and just two Sweepers so they chewed up a bunch of my ships.  However, it wasn&#039;t enough and the rest of my fleet hung out and bombarded the crap out of their homeworld. Yellow fell on Turn 16.

While I was tied up with Yellow, Green AP launched a 90CP fleet on turn 14.  I was on it though having saved some CPs in preparation to generate a fleet to meet them.  With 6SY in two systems that were relatively close together and SY Tech 1 I was able to put a decent fleet on the board.  I met their fleet and it was a good battle.  However, I had done one thing I had not ever done before in my plays of this game - I invested in Fighter Tech (I&#039;m not sure why I never went for it before).  By the time I had pushed past their 90CP fleet my remaining units from the Yellow campaign were ready to join the forces at the Green front and Green launched a 50CP fleet (easily defeated). I bid my time for one turn so I could send in a small force to generate their home defense.  I sent in 2 Mine Sweepers, a lone scout and a couple of CAs - intending them for mine fodder. Instead of mines though they ended up generating Bases.  I fled that battle until my main force could come in.

I assaulted the Green homeworld with 6CVs, 16 Fighters, 2 BBs, 2 BCs and 2 CAs.  My massive Carrier fleet could not be stopped.  Green chipped away at me a bit but by sheer numbers I overwhelmed them (and I totally forgot my +1 fleet size bonus in that fight too).</body>

	<body>The Rev was good enough to lend me this one again. I played it once on Friday morning and once on Saturday morning. Both games were with 3 roles.

Since my mood has been picking up, I found that I really enjoyed this game. It didn&#039;t feel like a crapshoot, it felt like my decisions mattered. I need to replay Forbidden Desert to see if this really is worth the cost or if both games fulfill roughly the same need. Oh, I won on Saturday Morning too :D</body>

	<body>My [-]second[/-] third go at Cursed Island.... and a success! I barely got any wounds; when early on, I found the boxes to store all my food so it doesn&#039;t rot, the game went pretty smoothly after that. Just one winter die in the last five rounds meant a roof of 1 was sufficient. Also, the explorer with his shortcut managed to give me two wood a round by the 5th or 6th. 

I will add that it helped that I didn&#039;t roll a single non-success on the build-dice but I only used them about 3 times, rather I attempted to use two tokens as much as possible (limiting my actions, but still :p)

I was also a bit lucky with some card draws. A Savage arrived and stole my weapon, which was already at 0 so nothing happened. I then later found him, dead (serves him right) but he had managed to nab some candles that allowed me to build more efficiently. 

The explorer also has an ability where you discard 3 morale and can draw 2, discard one of those little round tokens that give you some benefit. This allowed me to get an extra building token more than once.

My last playthrough of this scenario I lost hard and couldn&#039;t understand why everyone was saying it&#039;s the easiest one. Now I might.

This game should be played often, when you know the rules it&#039;s a pure delight. 

[b]*EDIT*[/b] Ran myself through the third scenario, Jenny needs Help! Well guess what? She doesn&#039;t need help anymore! Cos she&#039;s dead :(

The rope is huge in this scenario and I also had the Carpenter who builds a snare with it. You need to uncover three totems to get the rope built automatically. You can build it yourself but you&#039;d need hills terrain. Well, I didn&#039;t get either until about turn 5 or 6, by which point there wasn&#039;t enough time to build the raft and use it to nab Jenny. I doubt there was anything I could have done differently to win this..... the shuffle of the island tiles was the culprit. Annoying session</body>

	<body>One of the absolute gems in the VPG line, I remain hopeful that this is allowed to blossom in a deluxe boxed edition, one of these days. A really smart - seriously, the interlocking mechanisms on this are truly impressive - political game of hunting for a conspiracy and then taking it to trial. 

Possibly. 

You see, the impressive thing about this game is the variability of it; not just in how it plays out, but in what is actually happening behind the scenes. 

You are Thomas Jefferson, keeping an eye on the worrying machinations of Aaron Burr (the so-called Hero of Weehawken). Burr may be up to something, raising an expedition that could be an invasion force, a coup, or possibly a peaceable mission to settle Ouachita Valley. There are nine conspirators in the deck; three are selected in secret at the start of the game, the rest shuffled back into the event deck. You spend action points, you flip a card, each round, and you try to bolster your political strength, prepare evidence for a trial... and then try to work out what you might be putting Burr on trial for. 

The genius of the system is that it can be one of seven end goals you&#039;re trying to discover - and you might play a game where you don&#039;t even get to trial. 

I didn&#039;t, this time. I had plenty of federal agents, out in the Midwest, searching for possible conspirators, and I kept blundering over James Wilkinson (who may or may not be in on it), making his way down to New Orleans - which can lead to him tipping Burr off, forcing an arrest, or instigating martial law and costing me precious action points. I never found Burr himself, this game, and I fell foul of several expedition cards (which add to the power of his forces and mitigate dice rolls when you do an expedition check). Today, Burr martialed his forces and managed to start his expedition, closing off my chance at a trial, despite the fact I&#039;d drawn very well with evidence cards. Flipping the conspirator cards revealed that Wilkinson did indeed have a hand in it, and he and Anthony Merry, along with James Blennerhasset, were attempting to invade Spanish Florida. 

Impressively, the local militia were able to thwart this hostile move, ending the game with me sitting there with egg on my face for lacking the power to bring Burr to justice and quell the rebellion. Minus ten points, then. (And I distinctly recall winning this one, last time.)

A historical puzzle, a detective story and a legal battle (depending on many variable factors); check it out.

This one has been on my radar for years. 
Every time I read a great post about it, such as yours, I put it in a VPG shopping cart and then never proceed to checkout because of custom taxes (plus the fact that french customs almost lost a package last time: took them more than 2 months to find it in their premises). 
I stick to VPG already imported to France. Pity.

Good luck to you!  My first game resulted in a Fiasco and immediate loss well before Election Night.  I know some things I should have done to have played better (defense is a smarter strategy, I believe), but that game is a harsh mistress.

Don&#039;t forget Dawn of the Zeds! Although with the 3rd edition coming out soon it may be worth waiting. Very curious to see what their new production model looks like. Apparently the 3rd edition of DotZ is being &quot;mass produced&quot; instead of their usual print on demand. Curious indeed!

thanks for the write up on this one Jason, I&#039;ve been mildly curious about this title for awhile but never put any time into digging deeper.  Your write up definitely moves it up my list.

	<body>I won playing 3p (Mercenary, Commander and Medic) against the 4th scenario.   The medic allowed me to come back from an early Xenomorph that wreaked havoc in the combat zone starting in the 3rd turn due to a bad event draw.  In the end, 4 of the 5 HQ slots had been destroyed by events and the last was Ripley&#039;s rare costing 9, which I had been there since the first turn and I never did buy.  Fortunately, the Mercenary was able to able take out the Queen and Newborn as he had been the dedicate Ripley card collector and was doing 13+ at least one time each trip through his deck.</body>

	<body>Lost again playing 3p (Dispatcher, Containment Specialist, Contigency Planner).   Felt like I was keeping everything under control, had cured two diseases and then the outbreaks spiraled out of control.   It&#039;s more chaotic than Pandemic which I&#039;m finding I actually view as a feature of the game.   Since you never know where the diseases are going to show up, so the keeping the spread under control part of the game is more challenging, at least so far.  Of course, I&#039;ve played 20 games of Pandemic and only 7 of this, so maybe I&#039;ll start to see more patterns.</body>

	<body>In my ongoing quest to play solo variants I find on BGG for games I own, I tried the Ticket to Ride solo variant.   It&#039;s ok, but a little too luck based for my tastes.  My tickets we all in the West, which affording me the luxury of patience and I scored a very healthy 117, I think it would have been very different if my tickets had been in the East.   Intersting that it flipped the early push is to grab the short routes you are going to need, you have the luxury to be patient and wait on the long routes.

I doubt I&#039;ll play this solo again, but it was a solid variant, I just have games I like better.</body>

Things felt a little disjointed in this game but in the end I did conquer the White City and found the Green but by then I couldn&#039;t even take out a neighbouring ramping orc with 4 wounds in my hand.  Getting better but still much to learn.

Beating all three enemies in the White City and taking three wounds was a great moment (Tremor was great!).  Score a measly 87 and a loss but as Miranda might say &#039;Such fun!&#039;.</body>

	<body>My fith game of [thing=84419][/thing]. And... [o]it didn&#039;t go so well. :whistle:[/o]
DM scenario on the small map again. This time with &quot;normal&quot; :D :D :D difficulty.

[ImageID=2417502]

First round was over and I couldn&#039;t bring home some minerals. I ended with 17 CPs. What to do? Research or build? I decided to build another Colony Ship.

The second round ended better for me. I had enough CP to research ship size 2 and build another CS.

My first Scout was swallowed by a black hole and my Miner managed to bring home 10 minerals in round 3. I researched attack level 1 plus ship size 3.

Danger! My second Scout was out in round 4. I had a lot of CP in the end of round 4 so I gained ship size 4, defense level 1 and build another CS.

Round 5 and my last Scout was out. That galaxy is a dangerous place to be. Researched attack level 2. Now hurry up! It&#039;s time to build a fleet!

Round 6 was good, I had a lot of CPs and gained ship size level 5 and build 2 BCs.

Round 7. No research now. The first DM is coming. I build my first BB and another BC.
The DM entered in area 3.

Round 8. I attacked the DM with my fleet.
[ImageID=2417503]
I destroyed the beast in the second round of battle. My rolls were amazing! But lost my BB.
In the end I researched ship size level 6, build my first DN and another BC.

Round 9. I decided to build another ship yard. Is there a limit for ship yards on one planet? I also build another DN. I really had enough CPs in that game. It was amazing! If I had more SYs I could have build much more.
The second DM entered in area 8. That was not good! There were my planets!

I had to stop that thing before it destroys too much of my colonies. Round 10 had a big battle!
[ImageID=2417504]
The rounds of combat...
Me scoring hits: 3 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0
DM scoring hits: 3 / 3 / 2 / 3 / 1 / 1 / 2
That thing took down my complete fleet! I only needed 1 more hit and it would have been destroyed!!!!!! I build myself a suicide squad! 2 DNs.
[ImageID=2417505]

Round 11 and the final battle was fought in the nebula system next to my HS! I rolled miserable. But only for myself. The DM Scored 4 hits in the first round and 3 in the second. Game over!

What did I do wrong? I didn&#039;t get myself some new dice. :whistle:

:thumbsup: What can I say? I am addicted!
:thumbsdown: Again no Fighters... totally forgot about them. :D</body>

	<body>Hello!

I did another solitaire game, this time using the shorter variant suggested in the rules and using two bots - Donald was joined by his evil twin sister Dorothy. This actually sped up the game a bit and also made it easier as Donald wasn&#039;t able to hoard all politicians. Actually, I ended up controlling most politicians in the end (Donald wouldn&#039;t release the Treasurer, though, no matter what I tried).

I decided to stick to the variant rules by the letter (save for changing all complete 10 wealth for the bots to prestige immediately), although this lead to rather stupid play on one or two occasions (Donald wasted good points when playing the Nuclear Power Plant, for instance).

Getting the union boss early on was part of the key to success. And then I got all the good event cards while the nasty ones failed to impact me (I started with the Res-3 building to get the media vocation, but early on, it got auctioned to Donald who then abandoned it as he would have had to pay prestige to keep it; in the end it was removed following the local head lines). Very few value chips got into play (thanks to shorter play variant, I guess): prestige 5 got into play fairly early, but prestige 6 was delayed once because Donald and I were tied as far as prestige went, but it returned towards the end of the game and I was able to place it beneficially for me. 

In the end, I won with 169 prestige, Donald only scored 107 and Dorothy had a misely 64 prestige. During the last few turns, I really swam in money and I had hoarded vocations (the bots had been rather unlucky, with few vocations available and the bots sometimes missing them in their dice rolls).

It was good fun, although the board didn&#039;t get filled too well (remember, each bot plays one card and discards another). When going for a big session report, I may end up doing it in a more classic fashion. Or maybe not have the bots discard contracts?

[size=18][u][b]ORIGIN STORY[/b][/u][/size]

[b]What brought you here? Was it from a subscription, or did you find it on the front page or on a specific game page?[/b]
I don&#039;t really remember it too well (^_^;; I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Google had a hand in it as I came across this list rather quickly after finding BGG itself (which in turn was thanks to [thing=31260][/thing] about which an internet review falsely claimed that they included historical information in the rules book, and which caused me to seriously get into solitaire board gaming).

[b]What was the first game you posted? Do you still own it and/or play it?[/b]
[thing=51199][/thing] was the first game I posted. While I still have it, I have yet to return to it. There are simply too many other shinies here and it is a game where I really want to dedicate some time to develop the narration and delve deeply into it. And currently, I don&#039;t really have that kind of time to spare (^_^;;

[b]Was there anything else notable about your first visit?[/b]
Not much, really, except for [user=edjrjr][/user] sponsoring my avatar slot right away. 

[b]Anything else you&#039;d like to share about your first visit?[/b]
It was really nice how friendly people welcomed me as a newbie. That is something I think we should try to keep up.

[b]What keeps bringing you back?[/b]
Well, I have the chance to tell about the antics I encounter during my solitaire gaming. In addition, I can get feedback and advice, maybe someone pointing me to an interesting new solitaire variant. And then there are the fun stories I can read here (although I have been skimming things more and more recently as time is short). And I get information about all those good games and good solitaire variants.

[b]How much money have these lists cost you?[/b]
That&#039;s difficult to tell. While many of the games I purchased during the past few years (after only buying one or two games every other year) were found on these lists, there were a few that I stumbled across on the site or simply encountered at my local game stores. But it must have been a few hundred Euros by now (^_^;; (And I have already pre-ordered [thing=157096][/thing] hoping for their announced February reprint...)

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

Whoa -- successfully taking on [i]both[/i] the Donald and Dorothy simultaneously?!  I was wondering how that might work after you mentioned it previously, wondering if it would be more a matter of them kind of &quot;ganging  up&quot; on you or of them getting in each other&#039;s way.  Thanks for  reporting on it here!

And I hope you&#039;ll enjoy [i]Historia[/i] -- I have.  I love it when games come with built in solitaire modes, and the &quot;adjustable&quot; (both in terms of number and strength) &quot;Civbots&quot; here are nicely done.

Hello!

Well, as I mentioned in the other thread, Donald does not really care too much about other players. So, there are very few instances where the bots actually have a chance to gang up or getting into each other&#039;s way. In the very few cases where a bot had to be a tie-breaker for me and the other bot, I went with the bot favouring the one with fewer prestige, although I may change that to assisting the other bot instead.

This being said, they effectively get into each other&#039;s way as their leeching at the payouts ends with one getting the good ones of some rows, and the other the good ones for the other rows, thus reducing the amount the individual bot gains.

The short game play probably also weakened them as there were not that many payouts (and I was able to get dominance in that prestige 3 + prestige 5 row, which was the one big hitter).

Yours,
Deathworks

My first play of this one. I tried to maximize the number of provinces early on and strived for the Empire-development the rest of the game. I accumulated 35 tributes during the game and maximized my military in the last turn. Trying to avoid Famine at all cost I didn&#039;t complete any monument and finished with 81 points.

:thumbsup: nice components, lots of decisions
:thumbsdown: [thing=150927]Mediterranean Expansion[/thing] not available for non-kickstarter-backers (i.e. for me :() 
:thumbsdown: seems to be quite long without being too different from its predecessor (which played faster, at least for me)

The last point perhaps will change as I explore the game a bit more.

Second play: This time I tried to go for the ports and ships. Got struck by a lot of disasters and ended up with a score of 64.</body>

	<body>Decided to go back for another try, after letting Burr get the better of me, so easily, earlier. Things actually got off to a far worse start, with few decent card draws benefiting me. The expedition was kitted out, from the get go, and I just couldn&#039;t muster the prestige points to reshuffle them into the deck. 

It looked like I was going to be trounced - again - until I pulled three conspirators from the event deck, narrowing the odds for my investigation. Using the guide, you begin to puzzle out which nefarious goal Burr might be pursing, and I was hedging my bets against a couple - but making few arrests. 

With the expedition almost ready to roll out, I gambled and played a strategy I&#039;ve never used before. I let Burr go. There&#039;s one option to explore that suggests he is actually innocent, and it only comes up if his daughter is one of the hidden conspirators. Never seen it happen before, but I was heading for a loss... so...

Let the bugger walk free, flipped the conspiracy hand... and there was Burr&#039;s daughter. Poor old dad was only guilty of trying to settle down in the valley. I earned twenty points for rightfully dropping the charges, and one extra for my remaining prestige point. 

If anyone can recommend another game with this kind of variability and just downright cleverness, I&#039;m all ears. 

(I&#039;m also, oddly, feeling an urge to sing Hero of Canton... but it&#039;s been a long day.)</body>

I went to Hamilton College in upstate NY, as in Alexander Hamilton.

We had a kazoo band that played at half-time during football games called &quot;The Aaron Burr Lucky Shot Memorial Band.&quot;

	<body>Solo play with 1 handed deck (core set only - 10*3 cards to find the base of the deck).
Spheres: [b]Tactics + Lore[/b]
Scenario: [b]Journey along the Anduin[/b]

[b]Deck:[/b]
[u]Heroes:[/u] Legolas - Thalin - Berevor
[u]Allies:[/u] Gondorian Spearman - Veteran Axehand - Erebor Hammersmith - Gandalf
[u]Attachments:[/u] Blade of Gondolin - Forest Snare
[u]Events:[/u] Quick Strike - Swift Strike - Lore of Imladris - Secret Paths

[b][i]Game 1[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #10 (Had 2 Gladden fields I had to travel to and no enemies to trigger Legolas ability to deal with them. And didn&#039;t find any Gandalf to lower my threat)
[b][i]Game 2[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #1 ; (28+2 due to the first questing phase, so the Troll engage me and one shot a hero. Game over)

As it doesn&#039;t work at all, I change my deck to:
[u]Heroes:[/u] Gimli - Glorfindel
[u]Allies:[/u] Gondorian Spearman - Veteran Axehand - Erebor Hammersmith - Gandalf
[u]Attachments:[/u] Dwarven Axe - Forest Snare
[u]Events:[/u] Quick Strike - Swift Strike - Lore of Imladris - Secret Paths

[b][i]Game 3[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #6 (Two Hill Trolls at the same time, that is too much of course)
[b][i]Game 4[/i][/b] (without shadow card): [color=red][b]Defeat[/b][/color] turn #7 (Once more, 2 Hill Trolls at the same time, that is too much of course. Especially when they attack at the same time due to 2 surge cards)

So, whether a Tactics + Lore deck is not a good idea against that scenario, whether I&#039;m very bad. The worse thing is that I didn&#039;t manage to defeat any single Troll in 4 games.</body>

	<body>This has been a regular table game for a couple of months now.
However I lent it to friend for about a week but really happy to get it back!!!
Although quite busy, I managed to get a few session onto the table.
Again ... not content with the standard game, I decided to try tweaking the rules a bit! :modest:

So here is my
[size=18][b][COLOR=#330000]St[COLOR=#660000]ar [COLOR=#990000]Re[COLOR=#CC0000]al[COLOR=#FF0000]m[COLOR=#FF3300]s[/COLOR] C[/COLOR]ha[/COLOR]ll[/COLOR]en[/COLOR]ge[/COLOR] #4[/b][/size]
[i][COLOR=#0033CC]You have been instrumental in totally destroying the new generation of Nemesis Beasts from the Cathlor sector.
However the Delta sector is demanding your help and the Trade federation has made a deal to secure your services defending their Barter Worlds.
This has lead the other factions to distrust your motives.
One of these Monsters is now heading your way.
Everyone is relying on you.
Can you continue to defend the Alliance?
Will you be able to defeat the Nemesis Beast?[/COLOR][/i]

Full rules are available here: [thread=1321948][/thread]

:thumbsup: Quick Game with simple deck building mechanic
:thumbsdown: Needs more solo options for higher replay ability</body>

	<body>Oh man... I&#039;m a bit into my first game and this is most definitely living up to the hype thus far. I believe it was [-]Often[/-] [size=18][u][i][b]MOE[/b][/i][/u][/size] who mentioned perceiving the images on the blocks to be animated or moving or something to that effect. I definitely get the same impression. I see the battle happening. The card play is quick enough that it almost feels like it&#039;s happening in real time.

I&#039;ll have more thoughts upon completion. the Carthaginians are roughing up the Syracusians pretty bad so far.

[b]Update:[/b] A Carthiginian win is in the books. Syracuse pushed with it&#039;s heavies up the center map when it had an opening and for a moment, that seemed to have Carthage on its heels. However, a devastating counterattack by Mago&#039;s heavy unit broke that effort up in a hurry.

[imageid=2418320]
Boom.

After that, it was all Carthage, culminating in a decisive final blow to Dionysius.

[imageid=2418321]
Apparently, the second die wasn&#039;t necessary, but better safe than sorry?

So I&#039;m sure I made a few mistakes along the way. I certainly forgot to &quot;Battle Back&quot; a few times. Syracuse had 3 banners in the end to Carthage&#039;s winning 5.

Recently, with big games like this, I&#039;ve rarely set them back up for a second play. Tonight is a different story. I want to play another round right now, but the wiser me knows I need to get in bed. This game has left a great first impression. Enjoyed every minute. To be continued...

[b]Update 2:[/b] Second play is in the books. I call this one the Carthage Catastrophe. I thought of taking pictures, but I got so absorbed into the proceedings, I forgot. I&#039;ll take that as a good thing.

What I loved (Syracuse loved it anyway) about this game was that Mago&#039;s battalion got stuck in their corner for darn near the entire game. Carthage couldn&#039;t get a right side order card or any leader order cards to save their life (literally). So the rest of their army just had to suck it up and push ahead, getting pretty well slaughtered in the process. Finally, Mago got his stuff together and pressed forward, quickly taking out 2 heavy units within a matter of a couple turns. Imagine what might have happened had he been active the whole game.

Thumb time:

:thumbsup: Simple but necessary: The components are awesome. I have always written these block games off thinking it would just look weird on the table. Quite the opposite. Maybe it&#039;s a novelty that will wear off, but I find the aesthetic of the blocks moving around pretty striking. Like OFTEN said, I feel like I&#039;m looking over a map plotting moves and strategies, but at the same time, I can almost hear the shouts and the pounding feet of infantry and cavalry racing across the field. Pictures don&#039;t do this game justice.

:thumbsup: The rules are well written and easy to piece together. I missed a few things here and there on the first play, but on the second, I don&#039;t think I missed anything. A rare feat for me.

:thumbsdown: Stickering is a pain in the butt, but it wasn&#039;t quite as bad as I anticipated. Only took a couple dedicated sittings.</body>

I too enjoy this game solitaire. It is even better FtF.

The thing I like about Ancients is the different options available:
1. Battle back - really makes you think twice about attacking especially against heavy infantry.

2. Evade - I love the evade technique when using light cavalry. Light Cav really becomes a nuisance which is what they were intended to be...harassers.

3. Auxilia - put them up front and use their ranged attack to soften up those heavies.

I think I need to read the rulebook to see the differences between this and Napoleonics, as those all have parallel units in it.

I still have no idea if owning both systems is worth it.

I really think it boils down to which time period you like the best. Of course, if you have the time, money, space, etc. just get them all.

I have M44, Ancients, and Napoleon. I have never played Napoleon (and won&#039;t for some time because it is in storage) but I love the other two.

Me neither. I wouldn&#039;t mind a light WWI game but not at that price! I&#039;m going to wait till it comes to CSI.

Edit: By the way, as I read this, I&#039;m listening to this most excellent WWI podcast. Each episode is 3-4 hours long, so I realize it&#039;s a huge commitment, but I cannot recommend it enough. Listen to the first few minutes and try to turn it off, I dare ya. I&#039;m on episode IV now.

I like the innovations in the Ancients system quite a bit, in fact I didn&#039;t like either Battle Cry or Mem &#039;44. I wish they had those same innovations. I had terrible luck in getting cards I needed. In the last game of Mem &#039;44 I played, I had no center cards and my opponent brought the Germans off the cliffs of the Normandy beaches down onto the beach to run around and pick me off while I was helpless. [i]Check please![/i]

I&#039;m hoping there are innovations here. I&#039;m not familiar with Battlelore but apparently there will be an artillery deck similar to the Lore one there, whatever that means.

I was thinking Heroes of Normandie could be a light wargame for me but I think it occupies the same space pretty much as Conflict of Heroes and with the CoH solo module coming, there&#039;s no reason to keep it for that reason. For someone who has no light wargame right now and is very interested in WWI, this is just what I&#039;m looking for except for the heavy price. However, I found a group order and may get in on that.

I&#039;m hoping there are innovations here. I&#039;m not familiar with Battlelore but apparently there will be an artillery deck similar to the Lore one there, whatever that means.

I was thinking Heroes of Normandie could be a light wargame for me but I think it occupies the same space pretty much as Conflict of Heroes and with the CoH solo module coming, there&#039;s no reason to keep it for that reason. For someone who has no light wargame right now and is very interested in WWI, this is just what I&#039;m looking for except for the heavy price. However, I found a group order and may get in on that.[/q]

I never play vanilla M44. The Overlord format rules and scenarios really hit the sweet spot for me. Ancients is a poor third to Memoir &#039;44 Ovelord format and Battlelore first edition for me. The card &#039;issue&#039; doesn&#039;t crop up in them.

I have Battle Cry, Battlelore 1st ed, and C&amp;CA. Love Battlelore, haven&#039;t played Battle Cry in a while but I loved that one too (but may be a touch too simple now). I haven&#039;t stickered C&amp;CA yet. 

Oh -- Battles of Westeros is sitting on mu dining room table as we speak.

	<body>I&#039;m not dead! And I played a solo game, too.

I&#039;m still working my way through expansion 4 of last year&#039;s game, and it&#039;s still a great game. Amiri and Merisiel were not seriously challenged by the lamia clerics in this game, and I won easily.

I was planning to attack the next scenario, but I was interrupted by a visitor from Porlock then had to go play squash.</body>

	<body>[size=24][b]HA![/b][/size]

After a ridiculous number of plays, it finally happened.

[size=18][b]I WON THE COMBINED SCENARIO.[/b][/size]

I&#039;m not saying it was pretty, but I won.

With about 12 cards left, the Austro-Hungarian empire got invaded by the Italians, thus causing them to fall.

With that added pressure against the Balkans (Salonika front in Ottoman), I was doing ok. Why? [i]Because the Salonika front hadn&#039;t even entered yet![/i]

So I draw War Weariness and continue to plow through. The Caucus were hanging back; Gallipoli had already fled; and I had dealt with the Mesopotamians, pushing them waaaaaay back to the #5 space. 

I just had to hold on...
The Arab front crept closer, but I was able to push them back.
Using Yildrim, I kept the Sinai front at bay.

Finally, last card: Enter Salonika.

[b]Final score:[/b] 16 (Marginal Victory), but per the combined rules I nabbed an [b]Operational Victory![/b]

The irony in all of this is I still have yet to win Hapsburg Eclipse. You&#039;re next though, Hapsburg, you&#039;re next.</body>

Ottoman Sunset &amp; Hapsburg Eclipse are two states of siege games from Victory Point Games. They deal with the incoming threat of various forces into the Ottoman &amp; Austro-Hungarian empires around WW1. They are both small footprint, card-based, dice rolling games that seem a little tower defense. And they&#039;re both pretty tough to beat.

When Hapsburg came out, Leviloff (the designer) found a way to combine both of these solitaire games into one big one, that could be played solo or even co-op. Many of the cards drawn affect the other player and there is even a way to give the other board more actions. 

In this combined scenario, ultimately you want both sides to win, BUT if one side fails, the other side can still win but with a pretty tough handicap. I, for the first time ever, actually made it to the end of the combined game and won, but the Austro-Hungarian side of the battle lost, which made the Ottoman side winning more difficult and much sweeter.

	<body>Gave this one another shot, playing on easy. As expected, familiarity with some of the cards made the game a lot easier. I also really took my time, during the &quot;Commander has access to emergency funding&quot; step, to count the pieces already on the board and estimate how many more I&#039;d need to place. The app gives you enough time to do this, roughly 30 seconds if I remember correctly, and this is your chance to avoid going overbudget.

I played the Infiltration mission, which throws more Crisis cards at you than usual, but I found those pretty easy to deal with--it&#039;s a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; choice rather than &quot;OMG I don&#039;t have enough money to defend all these places at once!&quot; I balanced my budget well (this really is the key to the game) and completed the final mission on Round 5. Here&#039;s a picture of how it looked in the end:

[imageid=2418339 medium]

I ended with a score of 82 points (perfect is 100), which is not bad at all. None of my continents were in the red, and the base was on the last yellow space. I completed 2 missions over the course of the game, plus the final one.

As you can see, I tried a different board layout today, and it worked really well. Everything was in reach, and I didn&#039;t get that awkward feeling of looking at the world sideways. I did play all of the timed rounds standing up, but I do that for [thing=38453][/thing], too.

:thumbsup: The game looks really good on the table, with the minis and board gelling together well.
:thumbsup: I love the real-time challenge in games like this. And unlike some reviewers, I find the game mechanics interesting even without the time crunch.
:thumbsdown: It does get pretty overwhelming to remember all the cards in play and use them opportunistically.
:thumbsdown: Certain roles get a lot of clock time, and others seem to get less than they should (esp. the scientist).
:thumbsdown: Most real-time games are lightning fast. This one isn&#039;t--this game took 2 hours. It&#039;s like playing a regular real-time game multiple times in a row, except this one [i]forces[/i] you to keep playing until you&#039;ve resolved the mission, which took 5 rounds for me.</body>

I agree with everything you said. I&#039;m hoping that getting more and more familiar with the science cards help me play faster. Getting organized in a way that works for you is critical. I&#039;m enjoying it solo, but I&#039;d really like to try it with four.

	<body>The chosen were: 

- The Valkyrie (Skewer, Sprout Wings, Visions of Death)
- The Crusader (Wrath, Defiance, Annointed)
- The Monk (Chi Burst, Clarity, Quiet)
- The Scholar (Foresight, Preperation, Thoroughness) 

So the plan was half good fighters, half searchers in the hopes of getting at least one relic (and thence into the hands of the Crusader). 

But we got two relics early on (by which I mean, a little before halfway through the darkness track). We should have, I feel, with two searchers turning up keys, pressed for a third relic. I mean, we were even turning up keys in the castle, and with the Monk&#039;s Clarity&#039;s Chi Bonus, we could pull keys just about anywhere. 

Instead we started fighting the Necromancer. Everything seemed ready. Relics in the Valkyrie&#039;s and Crusader&#039;s hands, but our searchers were not up to fights and had lost most of their secrecy. We did draw the necromancer into the mountains where there was only one blight, and hit him with everything we had. Even the Scholar took out a blight, but the Monk risked a search when he shouldn&#039;t have and died to a Dead (Dread?) Servent event card. 

The Crusader wrathed a lot, but without secrecy he was vulnerable in the end, due to not being able to fuel Defiance&#039;s trade of secrecy for grace. Even with Bottled Magic we couldn&#039;t pull the win once the Scholar had luckily knocked out a shroud, and a Valkyrie attack had killed the other blight, whatever it was. 

The Scholar died next. I play without replacing heroes, by the way, because I feel after a certain point in the game there&#039;s very little reason to. This is possibly &quot;hard mode&quot; but if so it&#039;s not much harder than normal mode. The Crusader then went to the Promised Land, with one last die roll with no blights that did nothing. The Valkyrie lasted quite a bit longer, but without people to kill blights, and 1s and 2s being rolled by the Necromancer, she succumbed. At the time there were two blights in the monastery, with two more likely delivered quite soon. 

In the end, the dice weren&#039;t with us, and I was left thinking about how unfair that is. Beyond unfairness, it&#039;s also tedious as heck. [-]I&#039;ve decided to go with the following house rule, which I shall call &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;: 

[q]
The Necromancer is automatically defeated when: 

- There are no blights in his location, and
- The hero fighting the necromancer would be rolling at least (5 - (number of heroes in location)) dice, and
- Said hero has a relic.
[/q]

This rewards due preparation, teamwork and logistics, gives a better reason for replacing dead heroes, and reduces the inevitable excess rolling of dice. These are also basically the conditions for an average win through combat with the Necromancer during a normal game.

Because really, if you have managed all that, you deserve to win. 

Arguably this will result in more wins, in which case you can pull out the Darkness deck at long last to increase difficulty. [/-]

I fully encourage you to use whatever rules make the game most fun for you, but I want to point out those conditions are quite a bit easier than the &quot;average win&quot;.

Statistically, under the normal rules, you need to roll an average of 6 dice against the Necromancer to kill him (which usually entails multiple attempts with your strongest fighter); under this rule, your weakest fighter can automatically kill him on the first try as long as the entire group is together (5 - 4 = 1 die, which is the minimum you roll regardless of all penalties).


You also may want to note that fighting bonuses are more common than searching bonuses, so a &quot;half fighting, half searching&quot; party is actually weak in fighting and strong in searching compared to the average--an excellent candidate to go for the ritual victory, as you suggested.

Thanks for the insights! Also I am humbled. :blush:

I hadn&#039;t thought this through completely. Now I understand the reasons behind some of the design better. I&#039;ll play normally in the future and keep in mind the divide between combat and search. 

Probably would have won, sticking with the ritual win condition. We only had two keys to go.

	<body>I&#039;ve got this all setup on my table and ready to go tonight - we&#039;ll see how this plays solo and will report back.

UPDATE:
First impressions are quite good - the artwork is amazing, and has a &quot;Flying Frogesque&quot; type of characters / crew cards, while the encounter, peril, and resource cards have a nice artistic style.  The location cards look gorgeous, and the die that I received in the box is quite unique, having a 3d texture to it.

The player boards are ok - mine are experiencing warping on the first day out the box, and the back does not have any artwork on it (plain white) so that was a little disappointing as I thought that either a plain black backing or some artwork would have added a nice touch (although admittedly you don&#039;t look at those when they&#039;re flat on the table)

I also received 2 additional encounter packs (I didn&#039;t open yet) and a cool USB drive which has the artwork from the game - I did check out that file today and that also looks like a lot of effort and love was put into the game.

Now for the gameplay...
I played 2 solo games, changing my character for each play through, and I only used 1 ship (which perhaps I will try to manage 2 next time).  When you play the game you&#039;re deckbuilding to help you get through location and encounter cards.  The tough part is that resources are hard to come by - you can use your characters for resources, but then they exhaust and you can only make them available again by resting, or by playing a card that allows you to make them available.

There&#039;s a catch though... you need to find 2 keys which are positioned on 4 cards (2 have keys, 2 have blanks), and you don&#039;t know where they are.  When you move to a new location, your peril increases.  Once you hit 10, it&#039;s immediately game over!  Just under 50% of the peril cards are a &quot;3&quot;, so there&#039;s some luck involved if you&#039;re going to complete your game (although you can mitigate some of the peril by playing a set of 3 resource tokens).
Each time you lose an encounter you also need to pay a penalty, which for me was to lose a crew member (randomly by rolling a D6). 

My first time through I cleared 3 locations, but couldn&#039;t get the peril down, and lost before I could secure my second key.  The second time I played I was able to secure both keys and get to the final destination card.  On the last location you need to clear 2 encounters in the same turn, and the card also makes it a +5 difficulty.  So.... lucky me my peril card stated that the first encounter doesn&#039;t count towards the number I needed to clear (which was 2), so I needed to try to clear 3 different encounters.  I cleared the first 2, and had 3 cards in my hand that let me ready 1 of my crew (each card). I drew the worst possible encounter I could have which resulted in a toughness of 20 to complete.  

I had to look at the rules to see how the location effects would take place, and then my modifiers, which I believe I got right and dropped it to 18.  Looking at my crew I only had 16 points to use, but I had 2 money resources in reserve and a card that let me convert money into the other resource I needed for the win.  By the skin of my teeth I completed the scenario.

Overall, I think the game is quite challenging, even by using 4 rest tokens instead of 3 (rules state you can use 4 to make it easier).  I&#039;m thinking that using more than 1 ship would really help even out the difficulty; so I&#039;m going to try that again tonight!

Hopefully I can get some pictures on here, but it takes me too long to upload them :(

- that&#039;s all for now - </body>

	<body>Ok, I swear I didn&#039;t leave the house intending to buy a boardgame... but popped into the usual local spot to browse and read up on some box covers. Picked up both Sail to India and Star Realms, but put them down when I found this increasingly hard to find game, on a top shelf, in a dusty corner. Seemed like a cheaper than regular retail price, too, so figured I needed to give it a home. 

Just checked and it&#039;s on Amazon for Â£100! What the hell? Is it another gone for good title, or just between runs?

Came home to find [thing=125936][/thing] just arriving too. Productivity levels aren&#039;t looking good for this afternoon.</body>

Wow. I lucked into my copy at Target one day a couple years back. It was sitting there in shrink with no price tag. I took it to the front and it rang up as Deadwood something or other. I asked if I could just have it seeing as it was not in the system, but they made me pay 15 bucks. Yeah... I could have argued, but I figured 15 was a pretty good price.

	<body>Decided to take a break from my fantasy 10x10 challenge, and dusted off this absolute gem.  Played the Agincourt scenario to get back into the swing of the rules.

Since I&#039;ve been listening to Hardcore History&#039;s treatment on the Mongols (&quot;Wrath of the Khans&quot;), I&#039;m setting up a few Mongol battles next :)

:thumbsup: Awesome game -- really fast, fun, and playable.
:thumbsup: Gives a real feel for how the conflict *might* have gone, but is far more gamey than simulationy.  That&#039;s a plus for me -- I game to enjoy myself, I read to educate myself.  Not that I don&#039;t enjoy deeper sims, but this one is about the only tactical-level simulation I enjoy.
:thumbsdown: I don&#039;t own King of Kings or Imperator (yet).  That&#039;s being solved soon -- just placed an order on the &#039;geek for Imperator. :)</body>

	<body>A few nights ago I set aside some time to take care of the three Rallyman Challenges for the month.  The first two took a little longer than expected, so I did the third a few days later...



First up was the primary challenge for the month:
[imageid=2399049]

[floatright][imageid=2413374 medium][size=8]That went well.[/size][/floatright]SS1:  [bgcolor=gray]V9-V6[/bgcolor]/[bgcolor=cyan]J11-J14[/bgcolor]
SS2:  [bgcolor=cyan]J13-J12[/bgcolor]/[bgcolor=gray]V5-V0[/bgcolor]/[bgcolor=cyan]L12-L13[/bgcolor]
SS3:  [bgcolor=cyan]L14-L17/C15-C14[/bgcolor]

This set started out well and I was able to find a way to thread through the double hairpin quickly, but then all hell broke loose, when somehow all seven dice came up with hazard symbols at once.  Ouch.   Deep in the woods and rocks, there was no way that could end well so I had to use the SISU card.   That made the rest of the run more risky, but it ended up not being a big problem.   The remaining two sections both went smoothly without incident, aside from a spin crossing the line right at the very end of the third section.

Est. Total Time:
[o]The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota[/o]

----------------------------

I followed that up with a run through [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/18195767#18195767]Mud Challenge 5[/url], a mixed-terrain setup where everyone was forced to use Soft tires with no assistance between section.

S3: [bgcolor=cyan]B17-B10[/bgcolor]/[bgcolor=gray]A22-A23[/bgcolor]

I had to use my SISU card in the first stage again which never bodes well, but the second went lightning fast.  The expected losses of control happened in the third near the end, but with the second-to-last one I was able to push the car just far enough down the track that I was able to get across the finish line on the final roll.

Rallyman was still sitting on my desk from a few nights ago, so I took the opportunity finish off the third SGOYT challenge for the month:   [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/18204419#18204419]Rally Challenge 5 - &quot;Wriggle Room&quot;[/url].

Route:  [bgcolor=cyan]C18-C13/L16-L15/C14-C15/J15-J16/L14-L17[/bgcolor]

Even though it was set up to be playable with the base game only, double downshifting was allowed which turned it from a grueling slog through the snow into a grueling sprint through the snow.    The double downshift was used numerous times throughout, and twice I even did a double-double where you drop from 5th to 1st in just two spaces.  Not much room for error in those, but the clutch held out both times.   Trouble came a little later when I had to use the SISU to avoid a bad shift, only to skid off the road on the very next move.

Snow runs usually feel slow, but this one actually seemed pretty quick despite that loss of control.  Fortunately the rest of the course was mostly only short throws, and they went off without incident.

I&#039;ve had several times where hazards came up on five dice at once, but this was the first I&#039;ve ever seen all seven.   Taking a picture of it was pretty much mandatory.

Man, I can&#039;t believe the month is more than half gone already and I haven&#039;t had time to make my Rallyman runs yet.  Better try to get it done this weekend so I don&#039;t forget.

Our kids were given a set of [url=http://magnatiles.com/]MagnaTiles[/url] for Christmas this year, and they&#039;ve been playing with them almost every single day since.   It&#039;s a really awesome building toy that is made up of flat plates with magnets on the edges so they stick together and can be used to build some really impressive structures.   A couple weeks ago while helping them build something, I realized that the gridlines created by the square tiles looked remarkably close to the size of a Mage Knight &quot;Clix&quot; dial, and a quick check showed that they were a perfect match.  That got the wheels turning, and last night I had enough time try it out by building a dungeon layout.  The biggest limitation ended up being the table itself, but aside from that they worked awesome, and made a fantastic alternative to the ridiculously-expensive 3D Tile sets that were once available for the game (not that MagnaTiles are exactly cheap, but you can do so very much more with them).

Mage Knight Dungeons tends to go a couple months between plays, but this will make a great new option for future plays.

I am going to have to respectfully ask you to stop posting this game :p. (you are making me want this OOP game.)

Love the pictures and the creative use of the MagnaTiles.

	<body>Hello!

Well, I went down to town today since I had seen a game on the shelves of my game shop the other day and after checking BGG found that there were several attempts at providing it with a solitaire variant. So, I intended to make it mine.

But I usually check both game stores while I am at it, to see if there is something new.

And in the other store, there was Dungeon Roll on the shelf. Okay, it had been there already quite a while ago, but that had been the German version and thus definitely something I would not buy. So, nothing of interest.

As I idly looked over it, I noticed that the Pegasus mark was missing. Odd. I turned it around. English text on the bottom. Still no Pegasus mark. Could it be? I asked the shop owner, and he also figured it was the English version.

...
Insta-buy.
...

Well, getting the components all ready was rather quick, but some of the rules sounded rather ambiguous. I had to consult BGG a bit to be sure I got everything right.

So, I sent the Enchantress to venture forth into the dark depths of the dungeon. Right on the first level, her party encountered nothing - except for some rotten shelves that made a lot of noise that was probably heard far below. But after reaching the second level, foes like goblins and oozes attacked the party.

I was a bit worried after concluding level 4 as my resources were strained and there were already two dragon dice in the den. But I wanted to get that level up before the second delve. Go figure, level 5 did give me the third dragon die, but somehow, the enchantress emerged victorious. Yay! 6 XP, allowing her to level up.

The second delve also reached level 5, this time without encountering the dragon.

And the third delve also saw the beguiler and a crowd of three summoned companions defeat the dragon handily at level 5.

All bonus points added in, I reached 20 points, which is probably not bad for a first try. (Although I also think the enchantress is probably one of the most powerful heroes you can have since hoarding scrolls makes her unstoppable)

[b]Likes[/b]
+ Fast game - Fast to set up, fast to play
+ Well-hidden push-your-luck game - I am not that fond of push-your-luck-games, but this one does have enough steps and decisions to add more to the experience than just throwing the dice
+ Nice bits of flavour - Okay, there is not that much flavour in it, but there is enough to make it enjoyable.

[b]Dislikes[/b]
- Ambiguous/hard to understand rules - The game&#039;s core rules are really simple, but the individual rules for heroes or treasures are sometimes difficult to understand. And re-checking things, I found that the overview card of the treasures describes the ability of dragon bait different from what the rule book says (and I used the dragon bait in one run in combination with the ring of invisibility to get past a level).
- Not stackable - While the box is nice to set the mood of the game, I don&#039;t think I could put anything on top of it (^_^;;
- A bit more flavour would have been nice - Like a background story for the dungeon (okay, it needn&#039;t even be as basic as the one of Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord)

Yours,

	<body>Hello!

As I mentioned in the Dungeon Roll entry, I went to the stores actually with a definite game in mind. And that game was Tokaido (æ±æµ·é). I had noticed the game when I last went to the stores to buy [thing=62220][/thing] (a very good game in my eyes) and I checked it on BGG at home.

=&gt;Native language of designer: neither English nor Japanese =&gt; Good (the store only had the German version of the game)
=&gt;Solitaire variants available: 3 different variants suggested =&gt; Good
=&gt;A casual game =&gt; Very Good!

Sum: Go for it!

This time, I also checked the sleeve size beforehand and bought the proper sleeves right away.

Back at home, I found that the components were quite nice, although I was surprised that a game pointing to traditional Japanese aesthetics doesn&#039;t have a pink pawn (think cherry blossoms) or a white pawn (plum blossoms).

After punching out the coins and sleeving the cards (and deciding to go with Satsuki for my first game), I had to pick the solitaire variant. I admit that after reading the rules (first on BGG and then on paper), I was still a bit puzzled about where exactly the strategy came in (I had a vague idea but felt that seeing the scoring in action would help), so I couldn&#039;t judge the variants based on that. Since only one variant had the AI players function with all rules in place, I chose [thread=934988]that one.[/thread]

While the AIs did a good job keeping me from getting money during the first half of the game, they kept jumping ahead so far that I was able to get a lot of things. Thus, I got all three panoramas completed as well as having the most valuable souvenirs and the most encounters. Donations at the temple were a draw, and, funnily enough, the gourmet bonus was a three-side draw (each of us had 9 coins worth of food, but all with completely different combinations (^_^;; ).

In the end, I scored 101 points, Umegae 53 points, and Zen-Emon 51 points with neither having much to show for their efforts (although Umegae&#039;s start was quite funny, as he(?) initially picked the encounter field and met a kuge adding even more coins to the already impressive starting wealth.

The game is nice, but the variant as is is not really good at simulating other players.

[b]Likes[/b]
+ Nice artwork - The drawings are rather beautiful in my opinion and set a nice mood
+ Some good design choices with the box tray - How many boxes come with the tray being a bit bigger than the folded game board and then having dents so you can easily get the board out of the box without bending the box?
+ Interesting mechanism - With a more powerful AI, I can see interesting choices in there. The core rules are deceptively simple, but once players interact, things can get interesting.
+ Got the facts right - At least I didn&#039;t notice any big mistakes in the kanji and having all items named individually is also nice (especially since I am not good at food vocabulary - I rather eat food than talk about it (^_^;; ).
+ Lots of different items at the souvenir store - This actually surprised me as skimming the rules implied that it was a set collection mechanism. They cleverly based the set rules on the item type, allowing each card to be a different item
+ Lots of good design aspects - having a hole in the character cards where you can put a coloured chip to mark the player colour is really nice and especially useful for solitaire play. Having all card stacks (except for the bonus cards) on the game board is also very nice.

[b]Dislikes[/b]
- Some bad design choices with the box tray - Sleeved cards won&#039;t fit into the spaces intended for the cards, which is a shame. But what is worse, why does the box contain 80% thin air? Seriously, the box tray is maybe five centimeters tall while the deepest space doesn&#039;t go beyond two centimeters, I think.
- No pink or white? - As I mentioned above, I would have expected those two colours for player colours in such a game
- Colour confusion - Speaking of which, the German rule book talks about cards with a brown back referring to the souvenir cards which have a back that is mainly black and do not contain any brown at all
- Weak solo variant - The variant I tried was rather weak, but there are others and also suggestions for tweaking it.
- Eater of table space - Especially if the AIs actually got better at getting panoramas and things, the table could get rather cluttered
- What are the places? - With all that love for detail and atmosphere, it is kind of disappointing that the names of the individual locations are not given on the board

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

Pretty much got destroyed in this game as all factions started terrorising every other faction including me. It gave way to a lot of action, but made it difficult for me to build support back up once lost. I made some rubbish strategy moves that didn&#039;t work. In the end FARC won as they built up enough resources to remove teror markers and get their support up!!!

Look forward to receiving the new flow charts for the bots and playing a different faction. Should have [thing=127518][/thing] coming any time now, another COIN game to get into :D </body>

	<body>An enjoyable if tense game, and I earned my first 17-point score (17 points and 7 cash left over). 

I had a difficult time satisfying my casual customers so I just did regular customers... with one casual customer at the end so that I could pay 17 cash for the 17th point. 

Wonderful game and game session. I have a hard time trying to remember certain points to hang a session report off of, though. I never seem to remember the tipping points in most pure Eurogames, whereas I will never forget certain points in more story-orientated games. </body>

	<body>I received the game this week, and decided to get it out and give it a go today. There are a couple of solitaire variants on the forums already, but I took the bones of those and created my own variant today! [thread=1322518][/thread]

I had three games using one of the existing variants, then 6 games using my own variant. I won 2 out of 6 of the games with it, and each game was interesting and challenging.

I liked it a lot. We tried it two-player but would love to play it with like 4-5 people.

I also like FFG&#039;s new small box. Makes it super portable.

	<body>ORIGIN STORY

I&#039;m as bit late to the origin story game, and in fact the origin of the path that led me to this website goes all the back to the early 1970s.  A friend brought his copy of SPI&#039;s Phalanx to school and I was drawn into wargaming.  I subscribed to S&amp;T, and in 1973 a momentous event in solitaire gaming occurred: the release of [thing=8326][/thing].

[ImageID=293526 medium]

[ImageID=974916 medium]

As far as I can tell, this was the first purpose-designed solitaire game released, at least in terms of the games we all play.  I played the heck out of that game, despite a huge amount of errata.  

Since then, I&#039;ve been a huge fan of solitaire games, enjoying the First Golden Era from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, when games such as [thing=1608][/thing], [thing=3202][/thing], [thing=1681][/thing], [thing=1669][/thing] and [thing=1425][/thing] were released.

As far as I&#039;m concerned, we are now living in the Second Golden Era, and I couldn&#039;t be happier to see that solo gaming has now branched out into non-wargames.

I don&#039;t recall exactly how I heard about this site; my guess is that I followed a link from a specific game&#039;s BGG page.  My first post was in August 2014, for [thing=147747][/thing], an interesting game that has since been surpassed in my gaming preferences by the likes of [thing=140519][/thing], [thing=149241][/thing], [thing=146791][/thing] and, in light of this post&#039;s subject, [thing=104162][/thing].

I like almost everything about this site.  I like the structure, where game-specific info is attached to the item, and more general info is on the bottom.  I like the new info I often pick up.  And most of all, I like the game-centered, friendly atmosphere I find here.  At times I feel like a refugee from Consimworld, where a few loud and nasty voices can drown out the rest.  In terms of money, I&#039;d say where this list has cost me the most was in making me aware of solitaire variants for games I had earlier decided not to get (e.g., [thing=124742][/thing], [thing=47185][/thing], [thing=103886][/thing]). 

But on to today&#039;s post.

I had a great time last Saturday playing the first two missions in a [thing=164153][/thing] campaign with a friend and his two sons (they were the Rebels, I was the Empire).  I had so much fun the next day I visited a local game store to pick up some mini-painting supplies, and while there I noticed on the &quot;new&quot; shelf this: [thing=170959][/thing].  Realizing that SW:IA and Descent 2.0, share the same DNA, I picked it up, but decided that before I played the second Descent coop expansion I should really play the first, which had been sitting on my shelf.

So I started a game tonight, choosing one character each from the core game and the two Descent expansions I own.  I ended up with Grisban the Thirsty (Knight), Augur Grisom (Prophet) and Logan Lashley (Beastmaster).  Not sure it&#039;s the most well-rounded of groups, but I figured this is a learning campaign.

[imageid=2419257 large]

The way the Descent coop expansions work is that you have a deck of Exploration card, with each card laying out a room and populating it with monsters.  The card will have certain conditions and timers on it.  You start Forgotten Souls on the Onset card, but after that they will be somewhat randomized in that three main encounter cards will come up in order, you&#039;re just not sure when.

[imageid=2419259 large]

The rules for Hero activation are pretty much the same as the core game, but the monsters use special Activation cards to determine what they do on their turn.

[imageid=2419263 large]

You can get loot when you kill enough monster &quot;steps&quot; (each space they occupy is worth one, so a Barghest gets you two steps).  With three players, as soon as I kill five steps worth of monsters (e.g., two Barghests and a Zombie), I get to choose an Item.  There is a Doom and Fate marker that travel down a track toward each other; if they ever meet, you lose.  In my game, Grisban picked up a very nasty crossbow, which means I now have someone with a ranged attack.   

[imageid=2419264 large]

My sense is that this will end up a puzzle solving game, as you often don&#039;t have much time to do all you need to do in each room and then make it to the next one (when you open a door, you flip over the next Exploration card.

I&#039;ve just cleared the first room.  Lashley&#039;s wolf familiar helped to take down the first Barghest, while Grisban made full use of his abilities to take out the final Master Zombie.  By the way, it only occurred to me later that one of the zombie dog minis from Zombicide would be perfect for the wolf familiar.     

[imageid=2419265 large]

The next room looks like it will be more of a challenge.

[imageid=2419270 large]

Enjoying this very much so far.

If FFG ever comes out with a similar coop/solo expansion for [thing=164153][/thing], you can bet that I&#039;d do a Costanza and knock over an old lady to be first in line for it. :D

Thanks for describing [thing=153235][/thing]. It&#039;s on my radar but did not really know how it would work. 
This sounds great and my girlfriend and I are really looking foreward to try it out. Would be great if FFG would make a whole campaign expansion for this co-op style approach.

Kurt - copies can still be found on e-Bay for good prices.  There is a new set of rules that consolidates all the erratas on the game&#039;s BGG page.

Sebastian - if you already own Descent, then adding these coop expansions is a no-brainer.  You can read the special rules for Forgotten Souls here (they don&#039;t come in the little plastic box):

That is great news.  

I&#039;m on to my third room, with Grisom and Lashley severely wounded from the Shadow Dragon&#039;s flame attack, and Grisban now sporting a new longsword (he gave the crossbow to Grison).  I&#039;m starting to realize it was a big mistake not to choose a dedicated healer.

But the wolf mini looks great!  As Carl the groundskeeper said, &quot;So I got that going for me, which is nice.&quot;

	<body>Another one that doesn&#039;t get to the table as much as it should. Had an epic evening with this, in the longest game I&#039;ve yet played. (Almost survived the second battle, against the Goblin Shaman. Yeah... almost.)

Took a ridiculously armoured Paladin and unstable Rogue into the fight, this time, drawn at random. Managed to level them up once, apiece, with a Black Poison and Regeneration skill, respectively. 

First encounter was the Exploding Tomatoes, which I didn&#039;t find too taxing, at all... but it was the next, super tough, bunch of thugs that finally did for me. The Goblin Shaman is able to spawn reinforcements, as well as kill one of his own to embolden the posse. I managed to get them down to two grunts and the boss, but - in the end - the Rogue couldn&#039;t roll for an attack to save his life, even with a Dagger of Doom working its bonuses from the shadows.

:thumbsup: A fabulous adventure and a better time-based puzzle than the likes of Legends of Andor. The feeling is of my old D&amp;D days, working to build up a party, but also having a few laughs with it. The fact that I find this so amusing, even solo, is testament to its quirky, knowing brilliance. 
:thumbsup: I actually really enjoy the combat, now. It&#039;s abstracted, but it&#039;s far cleverer than early reviews have suggested. I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s that far removed from a minis game - and the stacks of life tokens are making me hungry for [thing=124839][/thing]. 
:thumbsdown: Time to play. The adventuring feels brief to me, but the combat, especially on the tougher bosses, can really draw out. 
:thumbsdown: The expansion isn&#039;t out yet!

[imageid=2419276medium]
For such small decks of cards, it can be a bit of a table hog. 

[imageid=2419287medium]
My unstable rogue is starting to look more stable...

[imageid=2419288medium]
The combatants enter the arena...

[imageid=2419289medium]
Might be time to start rethinking that victory dance...</body>

	<body>I gave Mage Knight another try tonight. I attempted the solo conquest mission. I thought things were going well initially, but things quickly fell apart as I assaulted the first city. I took one of two, but couldn&#039;t finish the job. Still, I ended with 103 points and loved the game.

Every time I go to grab a game and play this one shouts at me but I just never have enough time for it.

I look forward to a day when I can have a dedicated gaming space that I can set things up and leave them without fear of being destroyed.  Then, games like this and [thing=146021][/thing] would definitely get more love.  Hopefully when we move in a year or so.  

That, or when my kids all move out.... :cry:

	<body>Picked up the [thing=166679]Gates of Arkham[/thing] expansion for this recently. Finally got a chance to break it out tonight.

Trish Scarborough and William Yorrick vs. Yog-Sothoth.

[imageid=2419425 medium]

A rocky start saw Trish pile on a few Elder Signs before being devoured in an Other World.

[imageid=2419426 medium]

As Yog-Sothoth opens a new gate every midnight, William spent an inordinate amount of time in Other Worlds.

[imageid=2419427 medium]

William&#039;s power to spend a monster token to add the red and yellow dice came in very handy, especially in this mission at Ma&#039;s Boarding House.

[imageid=2419428 medium]

The board was littered with gates in the late game.

[imageid=2419429 medium]

With two spots left on the doom track (and a mythos card that would fill those two spots at midnight), William acquired the last two Elder Signs just in the nick of time.

[imageid=2419430 medium]

:thumbsup: Interesting expansion that uses the base game components with new adventure cards to provide a very new experience
:thumbsup: Adds new mechanisms and increases the difficulty
:thumbsup: Having to choose adventures while they are face down prevents obvious min/maxing
:thumbsup: More investigators and Great Old Ones, plus items, allies etc. that can be used with the base game adventures
:thumbsup: If you were almost sold on the base game but needed a little more, this may do it for you
:thumbsdown: If you really don&#039;t like the base game, it is unlikely that this expansion will change your mind
:thumbsdown: 8 more Investigator Miniatures to buy to keep up (assuming you are using miniatures like me)!</body>

[q=&quot;repairmanjack&quot;]Love those minis... :zombie:[/q]

On one hand they seem like a ridiculous indulgence, on the other they add a ton of aesthetic value to my plays of this and Arkham Horror. The only regret I have is not picking up some of them sooner as they are getting harder to find. 

Maybe it makes me somewhat shallow, but I like my games to look good on the table (they have to play well too of course). If I am going to spend an hour or more looking at a game I want it to be attractive. I love the sprawling and thematic Arkham Horror board, and I have spent a significant chunk of money pimping it out (investigator minis, gate holders, dice (regular, blessed and cursed), Dunwich horror mini, homemade elder sign tokens for sealed gates, etc.). Fields of Arle, a recent acquisition, is gorgeous on the table too.

I feel the same way brother. we can be shallow together!

I wish I discovered Arkham earlier so I could have slowly purchased the mini&#039;s over time. There are just to many of them and they are expensive.

I never planned on picking the minis up, but my FLGS (God bless them) actually carries them in store! Started out with a few and now I have quite a collection. I picked up a few more this week for the Gates of Arkham expansion for Elder Sign (most at my FLGS and a couple directly through FFG). I have Arkham with Black Goat and Dunwich, and Elder Sign with both expansions. I have minis for all of the available characters in everything I own except for 4 of them that have been sold out forever (I did find other investigators that work as proxies). The minis I am missing are (conveniently for FFG) available in Mansions of Madness (and nowhere else). So far I have been happy with the proxies I have, but sooner or later my OCD is going to lead me to pick up MoM for the final 4 minis I am missing.

	<body>I&#039;m getting more into building my own decks from scratch (previous model was to &quot;borrow&quot; someone else&#039;s list and modify it) while working chronologically through the LOTR LCG adventure packs.  I built an Elrohir/Elladan/Glorfindel (S) deck tonight, not exactly building for this quest in particular, but at least flipping through the encounter deck before making final card decisions.

It might be because I&#039;m working with a full deck pool and this is a very early adventure pack (back when the card pool was much smaller), but I thought this was a pretty easy quest solo.  I used A Very Good Tale three times in my first 5 turns (very lucky draw there) and I seemed to have good luck with the encounter deck.  I pulled mostly treacheries and they weren&#039;t that nasty.  I only failed an Escape test once.  

Gollum had four resource tokens on him when I quested through 2b and made the final Escape test.  I committed 12 willpower and the test revealed 8.  I think the massive amount of allies I had out helped a lot.  My final threat was 27.  I enjoyed the quest overall.

I&#039;m glad I&#039;m going through the adventure packs chronologically.  I think if I had played some of the current APs first, the Mirkwood series would probably feel somewhat disappointing.  Either way, I&#039;m still questing around Middle Earth, so it&#039;s all good.</body>

	<body>Hello!

I have run another very quick session of Tokaido (about 30 min.), this time using [thread=938827]this variant[/thread]. It differs by making the dummies move a bit slower and removing money from the dummies completely.

The absence of money kind of simplified things as there was less to keep track of. I am wondering, though, how much it limited the usage of temples (in my first session Umegae was so rich as to repeatedly donate 3 coins) (^_^;;

The slower movement of the dummies really improved the experience significantly. They forced me to jump ahead a few times to secure important resources and all in all, I wasn&#039;t able to rush ahead with the panoramas.

In mid-game, I was able to finish the mountain panorama as the first (and in the end only) one. No other panoramas were finished (I admit that I also helped that by blocking one of the later sea panorama spaces). 

I was kind of surprised that I did so well with the end of game rewards, although the gourmet bonus was really a nail-biting experience till the last inn as Sasayakko kept getting the most expensive meals (while Umegao preferred the cheaper ones). I also liked how I was able to collect rather fitting souvenirs for Satsuki, although the Manju in the end were among a not so good choice available.

Actually, Satsuki and Sasyakko were drawn until, as the very last step, the temple donations were checked. This was another strategic decision of mine - going for the last temple and donating exactly enough to be 1 coin in the lead (I needed my money for another souvenir, so I needed to minimize the investment).

In the end, Satsuki (I) won with 76 points, closely followed by Sasayakko with 73 points, while Umegae only scored 51 points. (Although I might have missed adding points once in a while during the session).

[ImageID=2419543]

This variant was real good fun. Removing the gold does not really reduce the feeling of authenticity of the game, while the shorter movement of the dummies makes them more challenging.

I may consider modifying the movement rules a little bit, though, in order to encourage usage of special abilities and also using the &#039;free&#039; spaces that may appear towards the end (if there is one or more empty space between the last and the one before them).

Even though I rushed through it, the atmosphere was feelable (and I really liked the souvenirs Satsuki collected. 

Although this variant also shows that while the game seems tranquil, especially towards the end-game, it is one of rather intense interaction and possible attacks.

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

	<body>Hello folks, did you miss me? I missed posting here, though I read a lot of the posts. I had an almost two months long streak of gaming with people, instead of using my multiple personalities, so I&#039;ve been absent for the only good reason there is.

Anyway, yesterday I took this off the shelf, for a quick initial scenario, to refresh rules and game flow. I recently bought the three first adventures from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, so this was a must.

Anyway, I lost horribly due to strong enemies entering soon, and no allies in sight. I used [user=xanalor][/user] killer deck, but it didn&#039;t matter, I got crushed.

A rematch is due today, I&#039;ll inform on how it went.

Feels good to be back!

My origins story is rather bland, I&#039;m afraid. I simply saw on the front page one of the lists, clicked there, and got caught. This has cost me some money, and many sleepless hours trying to resist the temptation of buying more and more. Recently I was at a local FLGS, and [thing=146791][/thing] was there, on the shelf, luring me. And, during one of my costumary searches online, a Spanish retailer offered [thing=149951][/thing] with several expansions and promos in a very tempting package.

I didn&#039;t pull the trigger, but it costs me a lot of effort.</body>

	<body>I setup my own learner&#039;s variant of this game. 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3JDHLkq.gif[/IMG]

Yup, on my 17th play I thought I needed to play a simpler version. The version is: No dice rolling and no abolitionist cards, good or bad. Everything in the game is predictable except the order the slave market cards are revealed at. 

I honestly think this is the game Mayer designed, adding in the dice and cards later to add in some variability. I&#039;ll tell you that to a nub like myself, the game felt almost identical to when playing the normal way, with regard to directing traffic and how it gets seriously clogged as the game goes on. I used the Preacher so money was no problem (as usual). I lost when too many slaves got lost in the late game (as usual). Setup to game end, 35 minutes. 

I think I will use this variant indefinitely until I start winning regularly. 

I also used the kickstarter slave catchers I just bought, for my first time. I&#039;m sad to say I don&#039;t think they make the game better, just different. I also feel that they have the added con of sometimes blocking your view of cubes in a given location, due to their height. I&#039;d rather they were Robinson Crusoe Player token size than the skyscrapers they are. 

I&#039;ve gotta wrap my head around this game already!</body>

	<body>In early January, I was browsing Geeklists (though I rarely spend much time on them), and ran into the &quot;2014 Peoples Choice Top 100 Solo Games&quot; list.  I wasn&#039;t sure if that had anything to do with the Dice-Tower, but I figured it didn&#039;t matter.  I like Solo games, and peoples&#039; choice sounds like a popular voting kind of thing.  I&#039;m primarily a wargamer, but I&#039;m always on the lookout for a good solitaire game of any kind.

I had previously never realized you guys existed!  Despite my regular posting to the &quot;Monthly Wargames on Your Table&quot; geeklist.  Since I live in the jungle (southern Borneo...look up Banjarbaru and you&#039;ll get an idea), there are few gamers around (that I haven&#039;t gotten into gaming anyway).  So, I solo game a lot.  

So, I joined the guild, subscribbed to the new geeklists, and then became rather daunted by how much more extensive your reports are!  However, I realized, I can probably post as much as I want and if people are interested, they can ask questions!

Here&#039;s my first post:

I borrowed this super-expensive game (a 1st edition, but still ridiculous) from my friend in Yogyakarta, Adhika.  He has played only about 15% of his current collection.  I&#039;m sitting closer to 70%, but wanted to get this played so I could either remove it from my wishlist, or bump it up (a $200 game sitting more than halfway down a wishlist is just preposterous).  

First, I discovered that the two board map backs were coated in mold.  I took some vinegar and lightly wiped them down, then let them dry really well.  The smell was gone when I started playing.  

This is a game about the Falkland&#039;s War from the British perspective.  I&#039;ll keep my report short, since there&#039;s not a ton to say.  I got zero cease fire events, Foreign Support got hammered early and often, causing a tougher enemy.  I advanced my taskforce too far too fast and took more damage than I needed (didn&#039;t realize the landings had to be done later).  I was surviving ok, but was never able to add to either my domestic or foreign support, and 4 turns before the end, another one of my ships was blown up and domestic support for the war collapsed, resulting in a loss for me.

Assessment:
:thumbsup:) You really get into the feel of the war!  Historical events cause you to pull your hair out.  Most raids are feints/duds (at the end of an attack, no one is dead).  Lots of fear of Exocet missiles and what the Argentinians [i]could[/i] do.  Great immersion (which is what I&#039;m primarily looking for)!

:thumbsdown:) MEGA-OVERPRODUCED!  Usually this is something that I don&#039;t even notice or care about, but, the board could have easily been half the size, with counters half the size, cards half the size, and money half the amount.  One reason it is so expensive is that it&#039;s just so freaking huge!  Also, it barely fits on my game-table, which is a big negative!  My baby (2.5 years old) found it rather irresistible because I couldn&#039;t put anything between his line-of-sight.

:thumbsdown:) The learning curve was brutal.  Everything was so easy, and then very quickly it went from great to dead.  In hindsight, I can see ways that I could have played more cautiously (or gotten different events), but that was very unclear at the time.  Also, the game has a great virtue which is that you can learn while playing, but you will likely miss some important restrictions/rules and will take a serious beating (like Operation Sutton not being able to be launched until the 23rd, or ships in the defense zone being able to detect and deter attacking Argentine vessels).  I&#039;m going to try again in March and see if I can do as much better as I think I can.</body>

This caused me to sell it.  The board and counters are too big and the gameplay doesn&#039;t justify the cost.

And the learning curve was high, I think, in part by some strange choices in organization of the rulebook.

This is, in my opinion, one of the most over-rated board games out there.

I enjoy and adore this game and shall continue to over-rate it! :p

We wargamers need the equivalent of an over-produced Ameritrash game with ridiculous amounts of minis and huge card board tokens. This is it!

By the way, glad to see you here, Lars!

	<body>I&#039;ve been working my way through this series of games this month.  I&#039;ve played the first 3 games in the series, [thing=75292][/thing](x3), [thing=93867][/thing](x5), and [thing=101628][/thing](x2).  I still have to play [thing=101629][/thing], and then I&#039;ll play the combined game: [thing=131874][/thing].  I&#039;ve won as the Americans and Germans in every game, but, the Americans have won 60% total of the games, and in some ways I&#039;m spending less of my &quot;brain juice&quot; on them in the first place.

Assessment:
:thumbsup:) They are great!  Accessible, short, and very easy, but still intricate, engaging, and part of a great series!  I deeply enjoyed my plays of this, and since it can be printed out and created for very little PnP effort, this is a big hit!

:thumbsdown:) The game is basically a huge luck-fest because standard cards are the primary randomizer.  Not just the card draws for combat (which is an issue of massing fires effectively), but since activations also come from card draws, sometimes a player can receive very few activations in a turn.  Ultimately this may balance out, but there is usually a turn or 2 of heavy hitting and getting passed over time and time again can feel frustrating.  In addition, sometimes one side can shoot 10 times at the other, and achieve no hits, only to be quickly destroyed by massed fires because a series of Aces are drawn.  Usually this kind of thing doesn&#039;t happen, but when you play these games as much as I have, you start to notice bizarre occurrences.

:thumbsdown:) This doesn&#039;t make a very competitive game.  Now, I played this solo, so it&#039;s not a huge deal, but usually you can tell who is going to win by the end of the first turn (because of beginning power of units or ability of the Germans to make progress before American Reinforcements come up.  A short first turn is always a killer to the Germans.  However, this can be somewhat mitigated by putting yourself in Peiper&#039;s shoes (the SS German Commander), and trying to think about how to overcome the American obstacles.  The Americans have challenges and can try to do a lot of really interesting things, but most of their moves seem somewhat obvious (getting on good terrain, blocking the German advance, and cutting German supply when he passes), which sometimes leads to a less than stellar game experience.  I have had a serious rally and win as the Germans once (my first game of The Bagged Peiper), and the lucky swinginess of it keeps the game interesting, but a lot of times you&#039;re just putting nails in the coffin.  Luckily, it doesn&#039;t take much in terms of time to finish the job.</body>

I did mix in the characters and locations but only played with the Unseen Forces expansion.  It went well.  I played against Yig and won easily.</body>

Lini retrieve the brand new Valeros to fight the alchemist. This is still with my own Pathfinder variant I describe [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1312765/my-own-variant]here[/url].

And that was close. I really though I&#039;ll regret the exploration of the closed General Store. Especially when Valeros hit a Trapped Passageway on the Guard Tower. But hopefully, Pillbug Podiker was the next card on the Tower and Valeros managed to make it flee into Sandpoint Cathedral. And as he was one of the first card of the location, Valeros could defeat him definitively.

	<body>Got in a couple of games last week, just now getting a chance to post them up here.

[size=10][u][b]02/10[/b][/u][/size]
Setup for a solo game while Denine was getting ready for bed.  Using the randomizer app, I had Black Widow, Captain America, and Rogue attempting to stop Dr. Doom from opening Portals to the Dark Dimension with the help of Hydra and a few Hand Ninjas.  My team of heroes fought the good fight, but ultimately failed to stop Dr. Doom from opening the final portal.  I think my main problem this time around was a combination of recruiting Maria Hill to up my recruitment points a few too many times, and barely being able to KO anything out of my deck.  I think I only managed to KO one Agent and one Soldier the entire game, so my deck was way too bogged down to get any decent attacks in by the end.


[size=10][u][b]02/12[/b][/u][/size]
Took another pre-bedtime crack at it, this time with Elektra, Iron Man, and Nightcrawler against Magneto, the Emissaries of Evil, and the Savage Land Mutates.  The villains were attempting to Steal the Weaponized Plutonium, which calls for an additional villain group, so Magneto enlisted the Brotherhood as well.  After my the debacle which was my deck in the last game, I focused on buying heroes for recruitment instead of Agent Hill.  I particularly enjoyed Nightcrawler&#039;s card that gave me +2 recruit with the &#039;Teleport&#039; keyword so I could save it for later, which let me easily recruit some high-cost cards mid-game.  The heroes were successful on this outing, managing to soundly defeat Magneto while preventing any villains from escaping with the plutonium.  Things were going so well, in fact, they actually delayed the final blow to Magento so that they could clean up the streets and recapture all of the plutonium that the villains had on-hand (and raise my final score).  My penultimate hand was one of those beautiful combos of drawing and chaining chaining cards which resulted in a truly obscene total attack, allowing me to almost entirely clear the board.  It&#039;s moment like those which make me really love this game.

:thumbsup::Combos!  Really makes one feel like a badass superhero.
:thumbsdown::Hard to KO basic/recruitment cards once you&#039;re done with them.  I haven&#039;t played enough to know if this is universal or only with certain setups; in my first game, with the recommended setup, I had no problem KOing, but have been virtually unable to do so in the two games since.
:thumbsdown::Needs more Henchmen groups, I can see myself getting tired of seeing the same half-dozen henchmen all the time.  Then again, they are just anonymous fist-fodder.</body>

	<body>It took me a week, but I finally finished another solo conquest.  It&#039;s so night to have my [-]office[/-] Mage Knight room completed.  I can have big games setup as long as I want with no risk of kids/cats interference.  I played as Goldyx and did well finishing with 186.  I can definitely tell I&#039;m still a little rusty having this sit on the shelf for over 6 months last year.  It took me until the end of Day 3 to reveal the first city.  I did end up conquering both cities during the last night.  At the expense of wounding 4/5 units.

I really dislike the fame/reputation track.  It&#039;s too big for what it does.  Takes up too much table space.  And on top of that, if you bump it pieces slide.  I decided to do something about it.  I took an old dry/erase magnet board (about 1/16 inch thick).  cut it a little smaller than the track and glued it to the back.  I clued some spare pieces to magnets.  Walla!  My track is stand up reducing need for space on the table.  I can actually move it and pieces don&#039;t slide anymore.

This is is a BIG game, but no bigger than [thing=146791][/thing] and smaller than [thing=17223][/thing] and it fits on my dining table so what the hey. But a good solution for you though.

Yeah, I&#039;ve played bigger, but I just find it... messy. Would be nice to have a mounted board with spots for where everything goes or whatnot... might feel a bit more &#039;organized&#039;, heh.

I have more than enough space for this game.  But for some reason I just never liked that board.  I always felt it was either placed too far away or in the way.  Either way, I&#039;m happy now!

	<body>Tonight was 5 simultaneous games - overall I have had better scores.

Abe: 84
Bob: 90
Carl: 82 (Personal Worst)
Dave: 120
Evan: 112

Combined with 2nd &amp; 3rd games from the last Bowl-Sol session, gave 5 straight games under a Ton :(

:thumbsup: A frequent go-to filler when minimal thinking is required.
:thumbsup: Only needs a poker deck, pencil &amp; paper.
:thumbsdown: As today&#039;s scores show: Luck - [i]but it IS a simple patience game, so that&#039;s built in[/i].</body>

	<body>Playing one of the simple solo variants, creating a max 7*7 grid and scoring as much as you can, and any discarded tiles count against your score.

Layout at game end (before I deducted points for discarded tiles and holes left in the grid):

Final score: 126

This finished off a pleasant evening of solo gaming, where I also played some [thing=139899]VivaJava Dice[/thing] (with both solo coasters) and [thing=121297]Fleet[/thing] (adapting the [thing=144811]Arctic Bounty[/thing] solo rules a bit (as I don&#039;t yet own that expansion so don&#039;t have the official rules to go by), playing against both AI captains; went pretty smoothly considering!).</body>

	<body>I happened to have another free night tonight, so I I got in my third play in less than a week. I gave the solo conquest scenario another try. I definitely did better this time around and actually conquered the second city on the final turn of the game for the win. There are a ton of things to keep track of, and I know that I missed one or two minor things. I think I could play this every day if only I had the time.

With 2 quartz on the wheel and 2 glass that left me with a whopping 17 points. That&#039;s a good score in Loyang, but not here. 
I did have a couple bad card draws where my builders came out before I could pay for them and the turn was wasted. A wasted turn is extremely costly in this game. Every turn absolutely counts. </body>

Yeah, I&#039;m becoming unsure about it. The tableau doesn&#039;t change as rapidly as it does in Loyang to make it as dynamic. I like having to &quot;make do&quot; with what I&#039;ve got, but sometimes if you start out with not much, or if you don&#039;t have the brains to &quot;make do&quot; (as is likely in my case :P ) then you end up with an unfulfilling game. Which this sort of was. I should just stick to world building with it since I liked that more when I played the other times.

Nice use of Village Church for 8 points and looks like a good 6 points from Glassworks.

Village Church can be tricky, as it forces you to keep a bunch of spots free that can&#039;t get you points in other ways (the Bonus buildings left on your Building board all would have rewarded Landscape tiles).

I try to avoid putting in my hand a card that I can&#039;t pay for if I draw it first - but I know that&#039;s easier said than done when you&#039;re also trying to build buildings to get points!

Your opening Building board looks really awful:  two 4-point Immediate buildings that require Glass ... when your best Bonus building is Glassworks, meaning you don&#039;t want to build with Glass if you can avoid it.

I would cross my fingers and hope to get a better mix next time!

	<body>Haven&#039;t played as many games this month as I have been sloooooowly working my way through panting my Zombicide miniatures(I find it to be very Zen).
I had this one sitting on my dining room table with intent of playing it at some point.
That point came tonight, and I actually got my first win, albeit on Bacterial Mode. A win nonetheless! It was one of those gaming sessions where everything clicked and I think being a bit more agressive with buying cards(I usually am reluctant to) helped give me the extra &quot;push&quot; when I needed it. Really dig this game.  </body>

	<body>I&#039;ve had the itch to play Mage Knight for a while now, so I decided to play a Blitz Volkare&#039;s Return scenario. Played on Heroic Combat Level and Tight Race Level. I&#039;ve never played Blitz Volkare&#039;s Return before, so I was shocked to see I would only have 5 countryside tiles. I couldn&#039;t see how that could possibly be enough. I randomly chose Wolfhawk and started the game.

The first round went well enough. I took out a keep turn 1 and recruited a Thug turn 2. Volkare stayed to the west of the map, away from me, but he was really moving at a fast clip. He explored, revealing several monasteries, which I unfortunately could never make it too. I was worried the game would end before I got strong enough to even take on the city.

Round 2 saw me taking out a Mage Tower in the middle of the desert. My thugs were injured by an Ice Mage, but I healed them with the Refreshing Breeze skill. The thugs having 5 armor for a level 1 unit is very strong. The spell I got from the Mage Tower was Mana Bolt, as I had a Frost Bolt I had picked up a couple blue crystals from, so I figured I had crystals to burn. Meanwhile, Volkaire explored the non-city core tile. I recruited a peasant, and got into position to reveal the city. I also attacked a double orc ruin with my new spell. I wounded my peasants and spent 2 crystals, but gained 4 crystals and some fame.

Round 3 I revealed the Blue City. Unfortunately, I had to fight a dragon to get to it. Fortunately, it was fairly weak, only a Storm Dragon. I blocked it, (using Swift Reflexes for an effective 8 block) then was easily able to kill it. Then I went into the city and  faced about the scariest thing possible, a Freezers in the Blue City! 5 Swift Cold attack is no laughing matter, especially when it has paralysis. That killed both of my units. Fortunately, I was able to kill all three enemies in one turn. Unfortunately, Volkare moved next to the city immediately after I conquered it, forcing me to declare end of round.

In the final round I spent my first turn recruiting Catapults, and was immediately attacked by Volkare. I killed two enemies in the ranged phase, then my newly purchased Catapults died to another Freezers! I was able to kill all but one of his units, thanks in part to a Howl of the Pack allowing me to play a card sideways for 7 attack! On my next turn, I rested, then moved to attack Volkare. I then realized that he was on a mountain, so I couldn&#039;t attack him. I spent 3 turns just discarding cards until he decided to move again. In the meantime, he had recruited another unit! Fortunately, I was able to kill both of them in the ranged phase, thanks to Agility.

Counting up my final score, I realized I scored a zero in both Greatest Loot and Greatest Leader. This was the first time I&#039;ve ended with no Crystals, Artifacts, or Units! Despite that, I ended up with a respectable score of 194. This play really reminded me of why I love this game, and I&#039;m eager to play it again soon!</body>

	<body>Currently on Kickstarter, but has a full preliminary PnP. 52 cards, but that&#039;s nothing to the right paper cutter, 110 lb cardstock, and a box full of sleeves. They fit standard sleeves, as for Magic: the Gathering and Pokemon cards. 

It&#039;s harder than it looks on first glance, and has a small table footprint and is quite fast. I think it would be perfect to take on planes or to waiting rooms with tables, moreso than many other games out there. 

Basically the idea behind Project Dreamscape is to play cards, using special abilities to create chains of specific dreams together. Every card has two different abilities (and each ability is linked to a specific dream type). Being able to pull different card combinations to create links is vital, and I still haven&#039;t figured out how to score above 38 points. 

I like it. </body>

The art on this one is gorgeous too! Curious to try it out.

	<body>I&#039;ve posted before about my initial thoughts on the game. Now that I&#039;ve played several 2-player games, working through most of the modules, and a 4-player basic game, I decided to return to the solitaire experience and see what I could make of it.

I&#039;ve been working on the variants described in this thread: [thread=1313932][/thread]

However, I&#039;ve also started removing things--especially curses, plus some treasures--that either don&#039;t work very well solo or just don&#039;t interest me. For curses, I found that having 7 dice makes it stupid easy to get rid of a curse with a few seconds&#039; work. To compensate for this, I weeded the Curse deck so I would be more likely to draw one of the physical curses or one of the incurable ones--my favorite is one of the Queenies that says that if you don&#039;t make it back to the safe room during the first or second countdown, you automatically lose the game. I also took out some treasures that I didn&#039;t care for, including the shortcut, which wastes more time than it saves. And I have decided not to bother with the two new characters for now.

I think that I&#039;ve explored the possibilities of this game enough now that I can start working my way through the Challenges the next time I break it out.</body>

Good idea about weeding the curses for solo play.  I&#039;ve always considered doing that (but never bothered, mainly due to laziness :)).  The no-talking curse is obviously fairly useless in a solo game, for instance!

I agree, having 7 dice makes things a little too easy.  I always play solo with 5 dice now, otherwise it&#039;s just too easy to win.

	<body>This is a game that I&#039;ve been wanting to try since I first got turned on to modern board games almost three years ago.

I used the official solitaire variant. At first, I was opposed to their solution for havng another player choose things for you, but once I saw how often that mechanic was used for choosing destinations and other things that couldn&#039;t easily be decided by dice, I chose to go with it.

I chose the familiar Aladdin for my first game. My three randomly drawn skills were Seduction, Weapon Use, and Bargaining/Evaluation...yep, sounds like the Disney version.
Though poor, I felt the the Pull of the Sea.

From Mecca, I sailed south. My first day at sea, I encountered a terrible storm. I tried to avoid it, but my actions resulted in the death of every other person aboard, and I became grief-stricken.

Visited an island, saw some big snakes.

Sailed to Serendib, met a talking horse. Asked him to accompany me on my quest. He politely declined.

Traveled south of P&#039;an P&#039;an. There, I met a trapped &#039;Efreet. I decided to try to trick him--being grief-stricken, I didn&#039;t feel capable of bargaining. However, I soon learned that the senile &#039;Efreet couldn&#039;t remember a single magical trick to help me.

Having seen plenty of the southern seas, I decided to trek north across India and eventually reach the Mediterranean. I returned to Serendib, where I ran into a malicious band of mermen! I decided that if I honored him, he might leave me in peace. However, I was unable to pay the tribute they required, so they sank my ship. I drifted on an empty barrel until I washed up, lost, on an unknown island.

I sailed east, meeting an impudent prince. I followed him, hoping he would lead me to civilization, but he and his crew merely scorned me.

I reached land and examined my surroundings. I was in India after all!

Found an &#039;Efreet bound to a cliff. Tried to free him, but I was not pious enough.

Traveled north to Asia. Found an old musty tome, but it fell apart in my hands. Decided to take a pilgrimage and get over this whole grief-stricken thing. Lying in wait for a ghostly beast, I learned determination. Wounded by a hungry gooleh, I traveled to Samarkand, where I met a girl and soon married. However, she died a week later, and the locals wanted to bury me with her corpse! Too wounded to fight back, I chose to accept my fate. Drawing on my determination, I survived by slaying the others who met my fate and eating the scraps and water they&#039;d been provided, until a secret exit led me to the fabled Valley of the Diamonds! Taking as many as I could, I soon attained princely wealth.

Traveling west to Shiraz, I encountered a toothless hunchback and decided to hire him. He appeared unwell, but I was lucky enough to avoid his illness. Discovered a crystal palace in Basra, but the guards turned me away. I became temporarily grief-stricken. I haven&#039;t mentioned this before, but every night I&#039;m terrorized by the baying of a great black dog, making me quite good at enduring hardships.

At the end of my pilgrimage, in Mecca, I bought a crafty slave who drew unwanted attention to my wealth, leaving me accursed. Finally close to the Mediterranean, I hired the finest boat to sail to an unnamed island and complete my quest. Through my determination, I hired an enchanted beggar to help me lift the curse.

I now felt that I had tested my seamanship sufficiently, and sought a new quest. Hearing of a giant inhabiting an island to the north, I set out to slay it. However, I soon found myself in the Palace of 100 Closets. Passing through the 100th door, I beheld the Jeweled Fortress in Africa. As fabulous as it was, I knew it paled in comparison to the works of Allah, and I undertook another pilgrimage to spread this lesson.

At this point, I had already been playing (and typing this up) for over two hours, and it was getting very late, so I decided to call it a night. I took some pictures so that I can easily resume at a later date.</body>
